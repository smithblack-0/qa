'' \\n▁ as i walked forward , feeling the sand between my toes , the violent wind rushed past my ankles , lifting the long cotton dress away , revealing things i did n't want him to know - things i could n't let him see ; all the damage that had been done , all the promises made and broken , showed in every mark on my skin . \\n▁ i squatted down beside him , letting the waves roll up and soak my toes , the cool , fizzy tingle reminding me how it felt to be human . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , reaching to touch his shoulder , but stopped . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i have to make it right , '' he said , his whole body shaking with the force he used against his hand - his arm straight , disappearing at the wrist beneath the water . \\n▁ ` ` how can you make this right , after everything that 's been done ? '' \\n▁ ` ` death . '' \\n▁ he frowned , his eyes fixed on nothing . \\n▁ ` ` if her heart stops beating , the pain will go away . '' \\n▁ i looked past the whitewash to the hazy figure beneath . \\n▁ her lips sat parted , her eyes rolled to the back of her head . \\n▁ there was no sorrow or regret there . \\n▁ not anymore . \\n▁ she opted out - ran away and left him to deal with this pain alone . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll help you , '' i said , dropping to my knees , my dress flaring like a parachute in the waves around me as i placed my hand to her skull . \\n▁ david turned his head , his green eyes meeting mine . \\n▁ ` ` you 're going to help me ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , knowing this was wrong , but knowing also that if i did n't ease his pain , he 'd leave with that creature under the waves , and he 'd return as something darker than he was now . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what will you do without her ? '' \\n▁ he looked up sadly at the ocean , somewhere past the edge of the horizon , but his gaze returned with a smile . \\n▁ ` ` die . '' \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ i shot bolt upright in my bed , a mess of sweat cooling my face as the sea breeze whispered past my curtains and touched my brow . \\n▁ ` ` you okay , ara ? '' \\n▁ david pushed up on his elbow , his hand appearing on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` god , you 're soaking . '' \\n▁ he sat up more . \\n▁ ` ` what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' i touched my lips . \\n▁ ` ` i had another dream . '' \\n▁ ` ` the one where i kill you ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ he shifted closer and hugged me , rolling us both back onto the pillows . \\n▁ through the dome window above us , the pale light of a moon in its first quarter shone down with the coming dawn , leaving dull , coloured patterns across the white sheets . \\n▁ i was safe here - comfortable in david 's arms , the world i woke to now no longer startling me in the first few seconds i opened my eyes . \\n▁ my mind and body had finally adjusted to my giant new bed , airy new room , and crowded , busy new life . \\n▁ but the nightmares i suffered the past week were stirring things up , making me uneasy , afraid to go to sleep . \\n▁ the song of crickets outside carried along the breeze through the open balcony door and filled the silence with familiarity as the edginess in my limbs fizzled away . \\n▁ i listened carefully to david , though , for any thoughts i might catch . \\n▁ his breathing was shallow , while his fingertip made one line over my shoulder blade repeatedly . \\n▁ he was worried . \\n▁ but i was n't sure if my dream or something else had stolen his mind to thought . \\n▁ ` ` nothing could ever bring me to harm you , ara . \\n▁ you know that , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' i said , but the nod i attempted failed . \\n▁ my eyes sat wide , staring into the dream . \\n▁ ` ` it just felt so real . '' \\n▁ he kissed my brow , snuggling down a little lower in the bed . \\n▁ ` ` bad dreams usually reflect inner - turmoil . \\n▁ maybe you 're feeling guilty for something . '' \\n▁ ` ` guilty for what ? '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ ` ` perhaps … for my brother . \\n▁ for being forced to deny his friendship . '' \\n▁ ` ` it does n't affect me that much , david . '' \\n▁ he kissed my head again , wiping his hand down the sweat between my shoulder blades . \\n▁ ` ` liar . \\n▁ i know it does , ara . \\n▁ it would affect anyone , but you - you 're so careful of other 's feelings . \\n▁ i know it eats you up . '' \\n▁ ` ` then why ask it of me ? \\n▁ if you know how much it hurts me , why keep us from being friends ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because he 's in love with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` so what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you 're young . \\n▁ impressionable . \\n▁ spirit bound to him - '' ` ` david , i ' m a vampire . \\n▁ that bind is so broken now it 's not even worth mentioning . '' \\n▁ ` ` still , '' he said softly . \\n▁ ` ` best keep you both away from temptation . \\n▁ not to mention - '' he huffed a breath out through his nose , '' - i still have n't forgiven him for binding you in the first place . '' \\n▁ ` ` fair enough , i suppose . '' \\n▁ i nodded against his chest , biting the tip of my thumb . \\n▁ ` ` and , so , you think that 's it - that i ' m having these dreams because i feel guilty about hurting jason ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i hope so , '' he said , brushing my hair back . \\n▁ ` ` because the only other conclusion i can come up with is that you think i might hurt you . '' \\n▁ ` ` for what reason would you ever do that ? '' \\n▁ he exhaled , his chest sinking under my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` none … hopefully . '' \\n▁ chapter one the hum of voices down the table melted into the soft sound of the piano being played in the corner . \\n▁ i watched the pianist 's deft fingers move across the keys , wishing i could trade places with him . \\n▁ i 'd much rather be playing piano - not a care in the world - than sitting at breakfast addressing things i spent all day either discussing or thinking about . \\n▁ there really was no escape from being queen . \\n▁ david caught my gaze and glanced over his shoulder to follow it , smiling back at me gently after . \\n▁ and for that split second , nothing really seemed that bad in the world . \\n▁ he was here , right across the table from me , just as i 'd wanted for so long . \\n▁ and after dinner tonight , i could sit by that piano until dawn if i wanted , maybe even beside my king , playing a duet . \\n▁ nothing in the world would grant me better reason to smile than to hear him play again . \\n▁ ` ` and how is our new king faring after his coronation ? '' \\n▁ xxunk asked , breaking david and i from our locked gazes . \\n▁ ` ` very well , thank you , xxunk . '' \\n▁ he bowed his head . \\n▁ ` ` any new developments with your powers ? '' \\n▁ walt asked . \\n▁ ` ` our queen 's powers flourished remarkably after her own coronation . '' \\n▁ david looked at me , holding back a smile . \\n▁ ` ` none yet , but it 's only been a week . '' \\n▁ i sighed into my plate . \\n▁ so we 're not telling them you can read my mind ? \\n▁ or that you can read mine , he thought back . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong , ar ? '' \\n▁ mike asked quietly , leaning across the corner of the table toward me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just tired . '' \\n▁ i dropped my spoon into my porridge , slumping my elbow down by my napkin . \\n▁ ` ` why 'd you come down for breakfast then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , you never eat breakfast with the people , '' morg added . \\n▁ i looked down the table to watch david talking with arthur , his eyes bright , his hands moving like he was speaking in sign . \\n▁ ` ` he said i had to - that it was my ` ` queenly duty '' to eat with my people . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's right , '' morgaine said , sitting back to sip her juice . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but i just feel so … i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i leaned on my other hand . \\n▁ ` ` ever since his coronation last week , i just feel so under the weather . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you sick ? '' \\n▁ mike asked , pressing a hand to my brow . \\n▁ i shrugged , sitting back in my chair , looking up quickly when i heard my name . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ david asked aloud , but his voice came through with a strong warning - holding the weight of everything we 'd discussed this past week about my duties as queen . \\n▁ i smiled , laying the napkin gently across my lap . \\n▁ ` ` i feel very well , thank you . \\n▁ amazing what chef 's porridge can do for a little fatigue . '' \\n▁ ` ` very well . '' \\n▁ david nodded once in that kingly manner of his , and went back to his chat with arthur . \\n▁ beside me , mike 's eyes shrunk from the roundness of confusion to tiny slits under a frown . \\n▁ he leaned in and whispered , ` ` since when do you perk up for the sake of appearances ? '' \\n▁ ` ` since david 's been giving me a few lessons in royal etiquette . '' \\n▁ mike and morg exchanged glances , and emily , so bright and fresh at this hour of the morning , offered a gentle smile . \\n▁ i looked away . \\n▁ her special immortal ` ` connection '' with david that allowed her to sense his feelings did n't give her right to think she knew what was going on with me . \\n▁ but from the corner of my eye then , i noticed her and david looking at each other ; david 's gaze was quick , and emily 's response - looking into her plate - made my spine straighten . \\n▁ david ? \\n▁ i thought . \\n▁ what ? \\n▁ are you holding a private conversation with her ? \\n▁ who ? \\n▁ emily ! \\n▁ ` ` yes , uncle . \\n▁ now that the castle is vacant , i was hoping to head out there this week , '' he said , ignoring me . \\n▁ ` ` we have over two hundred prisoners in those cells , your majesty , '' walter said . \\n▁ ` ` you will need more than the five men you ' ve got to go through their files and determine their right for parole . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been through most of the cases myself already , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` in fact , i sentenced at least a quarter of them , and my uncle the rest . \\n▁ it should take five men only three days to complete the task . '' \\n▁ david ? \\n▁ he kept his eyes on walter , giving vague details about the members in his ` clean - out - the - prison ' team . \\n▁ david , i huffed , slamming my palm onto the table . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ yes , what ? \\n▁ i shot the thought at him with enough force to almost burst a blood vessel . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ she asked me a question . \\n▁ i answered , he thought . \\n▁ what question ? \\n▁ i asked , cursing the day i ever found out that david could still read emily 's mind , despite her being a vampire . \\n▁ it 's not relevant . \\n▁ my breakfast suddenly hit my gut like an iron hammer . \\n▁ why ? \\n▁ because . \\n▁ david , you ca n't have private conversations with emily and expect me not to wonder what it 's about . \\n▁ what if i did that with mike - or jason ? \\n▁ i waited , getting madder by the second . \\n▁ she just asked if everything between you and i was okay , he finally responded . \\n▁ and … why would she ask that ? \\n▁ she thinks i ' m being cruel . \\n▁ he smiled across at me . \\n▁ that i forced you to come to breakfast . \\n▁ what makes her think that ? \\n▁ he laughed to himself - his secret smile stealing my heart . \\n▁ because she knows you . \\n▁ knows you 'd never get out of bed this early without a fight . \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ can she read your thoughts now , too ? \\n▁ no . \\n▁ are you going to tell her i can ? \\n▁ he turned his head and replied to arthur 's question . \\n▁ i half expected to have to wait for his answer , but it came through while he was talking , a skill i had not yet mastered . \\n▁ i sighed , picking up my spoon to eat the porridge again . \\n▁ he was right . \\n▁ it could be dangerous for anyone to be aware that he and i had any more power than they already knew about . \\n▁ in this society , i was starting to understand why everyone kept their secrets . \\n▁ it seemed less lonely , though , knowing i was n't the only one who did n't know who to trust . \\n▁ and i was glad david did n't even trust emily with the secret of his new powers . \\n▁ she was already two steps too deep into david 's circle of trust . \\n▁ arm 's - length was the best place to keep her . \\n▁ ` ` what is with you , ar ? '' \\n▁ mike caught the bitterness in my turned lip , reaching across to take emily 's hand , despite that she had n't actually seen me look at her that way . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ i picked up my spoon again and gracelessly shovelled the slop into my gob , stealing myself a moment inside my own head . \\n▁ the morning light moved across the glossy floorboards of the great hall in giant rectangles , spilling over the table and the vampires like they were nuisances in its path , warming one side of the room , giving halos to the heads closest to the giant windows . \\n▁ i turned my gaze to the painting behind me - the giant oil depiction of lilith mounting the fireplace - and gave her a weak smile , wondering if she 'd hated keeping up with appearances as much as i did . \\n▁ she did n't smile back - not any more than she usually did and , even then , it was fake - a waning smile frozen in time , as if she 'd sat for that portrait on a day that had broken her heart . \\n▁ now , it sat gloriously overlooking the great hall and all its occupants , but i got the feeling she just wanted to be covered over and stored in a dark room - away from it all . \\n▁ a bright flicker of white light flashed across her nose for a second , blinding me as i turned back to face the front . \\n▁ i put my hand up to shield my eyes , frowning at jase until i saw his smile , saw his gaze flick to the silver culprit , floating a few inches into the air above the table , shining the glare in my direction . \\n▁ what are you doing ? \\n▁ david looked up . \\n▁ what do you mean ? \\n▁ i was n't talking to you . \\n▁ his head turned slowly to look at jason . \\n▁ ` ` brother , '' he said in a tone so sharp the spoon fell onto the tabletop with a clunk . \\n▁ only a few people in their immediate vicinity noticed , but respectfully averted their eyes and attention until david drew his murderous gaze back from jason . \\n▁ but the sheepish smile jason flicked my way then made me smile , and now i could n't quite drop it . \\n▁ it might have been an unofficial , albeit firm , ruling that he and i could n't be friends , but that did n't mean he was gone . \\n▁ he was still here for me , and i felt that , even if i was n't allowed to . \\n▁ ` ` yes ? '' \\n▁ i said , turning to the person who tapped my shoulder , but there was no one there . \\n▁ i looked behind me , beside me , frowning in morg 's then mike 's direction every few seconds , wondering if they 'd tapped me . \\n▁ and as i turned back to the front , something tapped me again , this time on my left shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` stop that , '' arthur whispered gruffly , and metal clanged loudly on the ground by my foot . \\n▁ jason laughed , catching my eye , making the burning stare i could feel from my husband hotter as the room silenced . \\n▁ ` ` that 's two , brother , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` apologies , my king . '' \\n▁ jason stood , clearing his throat , and looked down at me . \\n▁ ` ` can you pass my spoon , please , your majesty ? '' \\n▁ all eyes slowly drifted from jason to david to me . \\n▁ the shoulder - tapping offender lay on the floor by my feet , hesitation rising off it like stilling fumes , turning a simple metal kitchen implement into a do or do n't . \\n▁ i bent down , grasped it softly and sat straight again , the spoon flat on my palm . \\n▁ ` ` you want it ? \\n▁ get it yourself . '' \\n▁ jason grinned , accepting my challenge , but instead of using his mind to carry the spoon , defying all laws of gravity , he pushed his chair out with the backs of his legs and walked calmly past each head , defying his king . \\n▁ ` ` my lady . '' \\n▁ he bowed , scooping the spoon right out of my palm before turning my hand and brushing his lips across my knuckles in a very polite , but ultimately cheeky , kiss . \\n▁ blade and nathan were the only two brave enough to laugh . \\n▁ everyone else practically held their breath , and when i looked upon david 's tight jaw as the table chatter slowly resumed again , i feared a little for jason 's well - being . \\n▁ he 's just teasing you , david , i thought . \\n▁ a grey cloud of irritation passed over him . \\n▁ he exhaled , going back to his conversation with a coating of less - than - amused paint reddening his face . \\n▁ even he knew it was all in fun . \\n▁ those two had been stirring each other since conception . \\n▁ it was just so funny to see it firsthand . \\n▁ you should n't press him that way , jase , i thought , not really sure if david could hear it , too . \\n▁ but if he did , he did n't bother to look up . \\n▁ jason offered an apologetic half - turn of his lip , lifting one shoulder slightly . \\n▁ he looked so cute and boyish then that i laughed , stifling it quickly before david could notice we were ` interacting . ' \\n▁ then again , he seemed quite distracted with being king . \\n▁ i could tell from the way he smiled , the way he sat so tall and straight , the way he moved his hands in a slow , regal manner , that he was having the time of his life . \\n▁ he was born for this role , and i was merely a bystander in the awe of his radiance . \\n▁ his people had fallen at his feet , showering him with their love and respect from the moment he came back from the dead . \\n▁ they did n't really need a queen to guide them out all this time . \\n▁ they needed a king , but not any king . \\n▁ they needed , we all needed , david . \\n▁ he looked my way for a second , a glance that made me curious about which thoughts he could access in my head . \\n▁ so far , according to him , it was only projected thoughts he could hear , but with that look he just gave me , it seemed as if maybe he was hearing more than he let on . \\n▁ i smiled to myself , coming up with a clever way to test it , then looked over at jason and focused only on him . \\n▁ jase ? \\n▁ he slowly set his eyes on me , his head staying forward . \\n▁ i ' m going to think something for the purpose of a test . \\n▁ they 're not my real thoughts , okay ? \\n▁ i said . \\n▁ he turned in his seat , intrigue lighting up his eyes and the sudden smile that slipped across his lips . \\n▁ i tried not to smile back , making my jaw tight as i leaned on my hand and , without sending the thought to anyone at all , told myself how lovely jason looked in that white shirt , with his hair smoothly brushed back , one thick lock falling against his brow , his bright green eyes casting beams of excitement across my heart every time they met mine . \\n▁ but david did n't even flinch . \\n▁ nothing . \\n▁ there was no way he could hold the anger in if he heard that kind of thought . \\n▁ it was confirmed . \\n▁ he could n't hear me unless i projected a thought . \\n▁ okay , test done . \\n▁ i smiled at jase . \\n▁ he bowed his head , touching his heart . \\n▁ the midday sun sat over the manor , offering more shadows in the corridors than light . \\n▁ i pushed the library door open and my eyes went straight up to the top of the bookshelves wrapping the windows on either side of the fireplace . \\n▁ they were normally decked out , packed tightly with brown spines and a party of dust motes dancing in the sunlight . \\n▁ but , today , the shelves were mostly empty , the books piled up on tables and chairs , making small cities over the wood floors throughout both levels of the room . \\n▁ the new librarian looked up from her pile and bowed her head once before going back to her all - important task of cataloguing and labelling . \\n▁ she had n't been made immortal yet , and the sound of her very human heart caught me off guard a little , a part of me wondering then if she was safe in here without a knight on watch . \\n▁ then again , she was still alive , was n't she ? \\n▁ no one had eaten her yet . \\n▁ so , i shrugged it off and grabbed the gold railing , my hand sliding over it on the way up the stairs to the second floor . \\n▁ as i reached the top , though , a cold palm cupped my mouth , gagging my scream . \\n▁ the mighty force of my elbow went into the person 's ribs , but he just laughed , dragging me by the waist into a nook between two shelves . \\n▁ ` ` so what was that all about ? '' \\n▁ he said , releasing me . \\n▁ ` ` jase ! '' \\n▁ i slapped his chest lightly , not really able to pull my hand back far enough to do it hard in this tiny space . \\n▁ ` ` you scared me . \\n▁ and what was what all about ? '' \\n▁ ` ` at breakfast this morning . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` that sweet train of thought you went off on . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ um . '' \\n▁ i poked my head out and checked down both corridors of the balcony , peering into the lower level as well before sliding back into our little niche . \\n▁ ` ` david has a new power . '' \\n▁ ` ` broader mind reading . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he ran his hand through his hair . \\n▁ ` ` i knew it . \\n▁ i just knew it . '' \\n▁ ` ` why do you say that ? '' \\n▁ we walked out of the space and into the openness of the library again . \\n▁ ` ` and you were testing if he could read random thoughts ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' i said with a bit of irritation . \\n▁ ` ` but you did n't answer my question . \\n▁ what do you know about all this ? '' \\n▁ he sat down on the armchair by the shelf , sighing . \\n▁ ` ` he ca n't read random thoughts . \\n▁ but he can read projected thoughts , and not just your projected thoughts , either . '' \\n▁ ` ` yours too ? '' \\n▁ my eyes widened . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . '' \\n▁ i sat down on the lamp table beside him . \\n▁ ` ` are you serious ? \\n▁ i mean , how do you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was walking the labyrinth the other day , and our paths crossed . \\n▁ he greeted me as usual and , in my solemn state , i thought how nice it 'd be to punch him in the jaw . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped a little . \\n▁ ` ` anyway , it was weird . \\n▁ he kinda … he smiled like something was funny , then continued on his way without saying anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you think he heard your thought ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ well , yeah . \\n▁ i pretty much screamed it to the gods . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you hate him - david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ his shoulders slumped and he looked down at his thumbs , running one over the other a few times . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't . \\n▁ but i wish i had his life . '' \\n▁ i smiled softly . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't take you for the kingly sort . '' \\n▁ ` ` not his life as king , ara . '' \\n▁ he bumped me softly with his elbow . \\n▁ ` ` if i were david , i would have run away with you , lived a normal life , free of all this . '' \\n▁ i placed both hands gently in my lap , looking around at all this . \\n▁ ` ` it 's safer here . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , it 's not . \\n▁ and david knows that , but he cares more about the throne than he does about - '' he swallowed his own words , almost physically choking on them . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i should n't speak that way about him . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ i stood as he walked across the room . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , really . \\n▁ you - '' ` ` i better go , '' he cut in , turning around to face me again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not supposed to be alone with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 're not alone . '' \\n▁ i motioned to the librarian downstairs . \\n▁ jase gave her a quick smile , which landed on his feet after . \\n▁ ` ` this is too alone for my brother 's wishes . \\n▁ i 'll see ya at dinner . '' \\n▁ he patted my shoulder then disappeared , and i stood for a few moments among the shelves and the smell of old pages trying to remember what i came into the library for in the first place . \\n▁ the housekeeper said he was in the study , the librarian said he was in the garden , and the gardener told me to look in the throne room . \\n▁ but as i climbed the stairs of the great hall after searching all those places , i heard him call my name . \\n▁ ` ` arthur , there you are . '' \\n▁ ` ` you were looking for me ? '' \\n▁ he caught up on the midway , casually leaning on the railing when he stopped . \\n▁ he looked like human - arthur today with his hair still wet from a shower , a white t - shirt over denim jeans , sporting that unshaven look that suited his nephews so well . \\n▁ ` ` everywhere , '' i said , leaning beside him . \\n▁ ` ` we must have been on a wild goose chase . \\n▁ i ' ve been looking for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he balanced his elbow on the railing , cupping a hand over his wrist . \\n▁ ` ` there was a pregnancy test in the infirmary storage closet . \\n▁ did you take it ? '' \\n▁ i held it up . \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ did you want it for something ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why are you doing a pregnancy test ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i still have n't got my … '' i paused on the word , knowing arthur was old - fashioned . \\n▁ ` ` my , uh - '' ` ` period ? '' \\n▁ i laughed a little . \\n▁ ` ` um , yeah . \\n▁ so , i thought i 'd just see if some miracle had occurred . '' \\n▁ arthur stood up . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i stood up , too . \\n▁ ` ` my dear , a pregnancy to my nephew would not be a miracle . \\n▁ it would be a tragedy . '' \\n▁ my shoulders dropped . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i just … a part of me just - '' ` ` wants his baby . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i looked at my feet . \\n▁ ` ` i love him . \\n▁ i want to carry his child . \\n▁ is that selfish ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , my dear . '' \\n▁ he touched my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` and to be excited about the miracle of life , even if it meant your husband 's death , would not be a sin , either . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ it was wrong of me to say that . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you were right , arthur . \\n▁ if i have a baby with him , there 's no one else that can use the - '' i covered my mouth to whisper , ` ` dagger of xxunk on drake . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but i was quick - tongued , amara . \\n▁ all life is a miracle , no matter the consequence . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , in this case , also means death . '' \\n▁ i toyed with the small box . \\n▁ he cupped his hands over mine and the box . \\n▁ ` ` please do n't do that test . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , arthur , if you and i are going to … you know , go all thanksgiving and get happy with a turkey xxunk , i need to make sure i ' m not putting myself through that for nothing . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but … please wait . \\n▁ david will journey to elysium this weekend to free the prisoners , you can do it then . '' \\n▁ ` ` why then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if he 's around when you … if you were to discover that you were pregnant , and he , with his ability to read your thoughts again , discovered this , he would not waste time . \\n▁ he would leave immediately to kill drake . '' \\n▁ ` ` you think ? '' \\n▁ i looked at the test . \\n▁ ` ` i am sure of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i handed the test to arthur . \\n▁ ` ` hold onto this for me then . \\n▁ i 'll do it on saturday . '' \\n▁ arthur smiled , bowing a little as he backed away . \\n▁ ` ` oh , and , arthur . '' \\n▁ i reached out for him . \\n▁ ` ` yes , my dear ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um , there 's been a new development . '' \\n▁ i folded my arms and walked closer , half checking for sly ears . \\n▁ ` ` with … with that new power i told you about . '' \\n▁ he cleared his throat , stepping close enough to be accused of wanting a hug . \\n▁ ` ` david 's mind reading ability ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ i checked over my shoulder then leaned in to whisper in his ear . \\n▁ ` ` he can read jason 's projected thoughts . '' \\n▁ arthur 's spine straightened . \\n▁ ` ` good god . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ he 's pretty damn powerful . '' \\n▁ he leaned on the railing again , looking down at the test before tucking it in his back pocket . \\n▁ ` ` the left - handed child . '' \\n▁ ` ` huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david . \\n▁ he was always the left - handed child , so i was n't surprised when jason - the right - handed - turned out to have a broader range of skills than his brother upon being turned . \\n▁ but with david having taken his oath , the added power of mother nature is like gaining another layer of immortality . \\n▁ his left brain will be developing at a rapid rate , giving him skills on equal to , possibly greater than , his brother . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` only half of that made sense , arthur . '' \\n▁ his lips spread in an easy grin . \\n▁ ` ` the powers one gains when becoming immortal are based greatly on which side of the brain they use more . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , left - brained people get more power ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ it 's not about greater or weaker powers , but which powers . \\n▁ i was ambidextrous in my human life . '' \\n▁ he held out both hands . \\n▁ ` ` when i turned , the function in my brain which allowed me to use both sides simultaneously also gave me the ability to think at a higher level of consciousness - to see past the impossible , bypass the rules of physics and control things others could n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , if david 's brain is essentially becoming ambidextrous , could he end up with powers like yours ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure . \\n▁ the strength of his coronation can not change his brain 's imprint . \\n▁ he can not suddenly gain power that was never possible ; it will merely open his mind to what it was capable of before . \\n▁ whatever jason is capable of - '' his eyes narrowed , his gaze distant . \\n▁ ` ` david may be very soon , also . '' \\n▁ ` ` so i should watch to see if he starts writing with his right hand ? '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ watch your thoughts , and i will make sure i watch mine . '' \\n▁ i felt a chill pass through me . \\n▁ ` ` what if he found out about … '' ` ` he can never find out what happened between us in that training hall , amara . \\n▁ ever . \\n▁ because it will not just be my head on a spike - '' he turned and looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll be yours . '' \\n▁ i wanted to object , tell him david would never do that to me . \\n▁ but arthur was right . \\n▁ he did it to pepper , he tried to do it to jason , and being his wife did not place me above the law in david 's mind . \\n▁ he 'd even said as much . \\n▁ if i broke the law by fornicating or even plotting to xxunk with his uncle , he 'd punish me to the full extent of the law . \\n▁ unless … ` ` wait ! \\n▁ are n't i allowed to have more than one husband ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ but that wo n't protect you from what we ' ve done in the past , my dear . \\n▁ and , in order to marry another man , you must submit your intent to marry with the lower parliament and it must be approved by the people before you can so much as think about touching him . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ our laws on fidelity are ironclad . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you think we should … ? '' \\n▁ he laughed , his sweet smile warming his blue eyes , showing the younger , human version of arthur . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ absolutely not , my dear . \\n▁ that would be suicide , and i do n't fancy explaining to my nephew why we ' ve suddenly developed a love enough to marry . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . \\n▁ sorry . '' \\n▁ i screwed my face up in awkward frown . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't really thinking . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's quite all right . '' \\n▁ he wrapped his arm over my shoulder and pulled me close for a second . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll figure this out . \\n▁ for now , mind your thoughts and bide your time . \\n▁ and hope to god you 're not carrying his child , or this fight will be over before it 's begun . '' \\n▁ i nodded , sighing out my disappointment as arthur walked away . \\n▁ court was packed . \\n▁ more bodies had crammed themselves into that throne room since david returned as king than they had on the day of my coronation . \\n▁ i glanced at my husband on his throne and offered a smile , standing taller as i walked across the platform in front of the hundreds , all waiting for an appointment with their king . \\n▁ i could smell the tasty blood of those who had come over from the dark side - a number that far outweighed the amount of heartbeats i could hear in the room - and rather than making me hungry , it made me uneasy . \\n▁ if all those vampires suddenly turned on my people , it would be a slaughter without chance for a war . \\n▁ ` ` now there 's a sight for sore eyes . \\n▁ where have you been all day , my love ? '' \\n▁ david reached for my hand as i sat down . \\n▁ ` ` i asked after you , but no one seemed to know where you were . '' \\n▁ ` ` i had business to take care of . '' \\n▁ ` ` business ? '' \\n▁ his brow arched . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what business does a queen have that she can not share with her king ? '' \\n▁ the noise of the people had a gentle kind of hum to it , enough that i almost felt like a human in a room full of humans - like none of the people in the first few rows could hear our private chatter if they wanted . \\n▁ ` ` talk about it later ? '' \\n▁ he smiled , squeezing my hand gently . \\n▁ ` ` this suits you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what does ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this . '' \\n▁ he nodded to the adoring masses . \\n▁ ` ` being queen . '' \\n▁ ` ` you think ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he leaned a little closer , closing the gap between our chairs . \\n▁ ` ` wan na know a secret ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm - hm . '' \\n▁ i smiled , loving the burn of excitement my heart felt every time he came back down to earth long enough to be my david again . \\n▁ ` ` i always dreamed of this . \\n▁ always wanted to be king . \\n▁ but , in all my fantasies , had never imagined such a queen beside me - could never have crafted such a beautiful creature as you . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , shucks . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not kidding , ara , '' he said , his voice soft but firm . \\n▁ ` ` i know we give you a hard time . \\n▁ i know i ' m on your back a lot lately about being a perfect queen , but you rise to every challenge i set , and i ' m proud of you . \\n▁ and i ' m proud to sit beside you as your king . '' \\n▁ i held very still , taking a moment to bask in the warmth of his words . \\n▁ ` ` so , nice - david got out of bed today ? '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` he does that … on occasion . '' \\n▁ i squeezed his hand back . \\n▁ ` ` i miss you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he sat tall in his chair again as walter banged the stick , settling the room to silence . \\n▁ ` ` high lord of the court , please present the first case , '' i said . \\n▁ chapter two the house of the damned had grown since we first built it . \\n▁ in only a few months , the rectangle building , with enough space to sleep ten children comfortably , now had its own observation wing , secure section , adoption offices , and staff cafe - for the xxunk and humans . \\n▁ its expanse of one - building - tall , fifteen - cars - long , had grown to two stories high on the west wing and sat in an l shape at least thirty cars long , shining like a glorious shrine under the daylight among the green fields . \\n▁ it was a place anyone would be glad to call home , and i felt a pang of pride for making it all happen . \\n▁ we 'd come a long way from those days i sat merely thinking about the children , recording the nightmares they caused me in my diary . \\n▁ i wandered down the hillside , stomping my feet a little harder than necessary for a light - footed immortal , driven toward the damned house like a child on her way to a play - date , but stopped when i heard my name . \\n▁ ` ` oh , hey , jase . \\n▁ did n't see you there . '' \\n▁ ` ` come ` ere a sec ? '' \\n▁ he curled his arm inward , waving me over . \\n▁ i detoured toward the square of cement , catching the basketball that bounced in my direction . \\n▁ ` ` when did we get a hoop ? '' \\n▁ he looked up at the glass - backed board . \\n▁ ` ` mike just had it installed . \\n▁ i ' m testing it out . '' \\n▁ ` ` cool . '' \\n▁ i ditched the ball and watched it slip through the hoop without touching the sides . \\n▁ ` ` why 'd he put it out here ? \\n▁ this group of kids are n't allowed outside . '' \\n▁ ` ` yet . '' \\n▁ jase grinned . \\n▁ ` ` well - '' i tossed him the ball , half aware of the little faces watching us through the window behind me . \\n▁ ` ` hopefully , they 'll just be cleared for adoption soon and we wo n't need an institute for them . \\n▁ or maybe we 'll just find that cure instead . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , actually , i have a few theories on that , '' he said , bouncing the ball as he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` i wan na test out your blue light - see exactly what kind of electricity it is , because that whole heart - starting thing has my head going round in circles . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , it seems to be made up of static energy , but that should n't cause such a dramatic effect when shoot - '' ` ` ara ! '' \\n▁ jase stopped talking and looked up the hill . \\n▁ ` ` great , '' he muttered under his breath . \\n▁ i spun around to watch david approach at a fast , human pace . \\n▁ ` ` hi , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's tuesday , '' i said flatly . \\n▁ ` ` i always visit the children on tuesday . '' \\n▁ ` ` how convenient . '' \\n▁ he stood beside me , eyeing his brother . \\n▁ ` ` and you both just happened to cross paths . '' \\n▁ jase sighed , tossing the ball away over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` whatever , man . '' \\n▁ ` ` i believe the title you were looking for is your majesty , '' david called after jason , who just shook his head , walking slowly off over the hill . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't have to do that . '' \\n▁ i glared up at my king . \\n▁ ` ` he was here before i got here . \\n▁ i ran into him . '' \\n▁ ` ` like i said . '' \\n▁ he turned away . \\n▁ ` ` convenient . '' \\n▁ ` ` you really do think the worst of people , do n't you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he headed toward the house . \\n▁ ` ` i think the worst of him . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's your brother , david . '' \\n▁ he turned around and walked backward . \\n▁ ` ` and i love him as such . \\n▁ provided he stays away from my wife . '' \\n▁ i imprisoned my smile , shaking my head , watching the bright sun turn to shadow over david 's brown hair as he disappeared under the eaves of the house , flicking a quick grin my way before heading inside . \\n▁ how could that man irritate me so much , then blast it all away with one look ? \\n▁ i groaned , running after him . \\n▁ ` ` would you wait up ? '' \\n▁ he held the door open with his foot , signing both himself and me in to the logbook . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just giving him a hard time , ara . \\n▁ you know that , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you 're doing everything you can to make sure he 's afraid to even look at me . '' \\n▁ the door closed behind me , locking into place as it shut . \\n▁ ` ` can you blame me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i said , folding my arms . \\n▁ ` ` but do n't try to play innocent when i accuse you of being nasty . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ i ' m being nasty . \\n▁ get over it . '' \\n▁ he handed me a visitor 's pass . \\n▁ ` ` if he 'd never spirit bound you , we would n't have a problem . '' \\n▁ i groaned , rolling my eyes , then held up the badge . \\n▁ ` ` what 's this for ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i want you to come to the restricted block - see max . '' \\n▁ i lowered the pass , toying with it for a second as the image of max on the day i first met him flashed in my mind . \\n▁ he was so small and so thin , and his eyes were so hollow and dark . \\n▁ but it was n't the eternal sadness of his little soul that haunted me the most . \\n▁ it was the way the keeper 's metal stick speared his ribs and broke his skin , the child screaming then just laying there - all instinct to fight dead inside him . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ david cupped my hand and steered the badge up to my chest , pinning it to my blouse . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't remember anything now . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i heard it took several sessions with jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but last night , max actually slept . '' \\n▁ i smiled at my feet . \\n▁ ` ` what about joshua - his brother ? '' \\n▁ david hooked a finger under my chin to roll it upward . \\n▁ ` ` they 're both fine . \\n▁ come see . '' \\n▁ when we cleared the second security gate and locked it behind us , i heard a little voice squeal my name and a flash of gold hair tied with a pink ribbon caught my eye across the room , appearing beside me a second later . \\n▁ ` ` look what i can do , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m watching , lacey . '' \\n▁ i stood back , folding my arms , a smile holding a certain amount of excitement and interest across my face . \\n▁ ` ` one , two , thr - '' lacey grunted on the last word , tipping herself forward as both hands came down to the ground and her feet went vertical , the cuffs of her jeans sliding up her skinny ankles a little . \\n▁ i clapped . \\n▁ ` ` yay ! \\n▁ well done , lacey . \\n▁ and did you practice with the hula hoop today ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yep . \\n▁ i can do it for three minutes now , '' she said , holding up four fingers . \\n▁ ` ` aw , well - '' i reached out and pulled her close for a hug ; her tiny arms wrapped my waist , her head sitting just under my ribs . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you can show me when i come back from visiting with max and xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ she pulled away and placed both hands behind her back , smiling up at me . \\n▁ she was the most adorable child out of this group - her blond hair and bright smile lighting my every visit . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ david said softly , closing the security gate behind himself and a sharp - faced man with dark , receding hair - the kind of man who looked like he 'd spent too long working in an office and not enough time in the sun , enjoying things , like a smile . \\n▁ ` ` go play , lacey , '' i said softly , touching her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll come by later . '' \\n▁ she toddled off and sat in the art corner beside her little friend . \\n▁ ` ` this is ross johnson , '' david announced , and ross offered his hand . \\n▁ ` ` he 's come by to assess charles . '' \\n▁ ` ` great . '' \\n▁ i shook his hand and dropped it quickly , fighting the urge to wipe it on my jeans . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry we had to call you in , but we ca n't really send our head psychologist in with charles , because she 's lilithian . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , i ' ve been made aware of the basics of the case . \\n▁ now , i understand this is the second group of children to come through the house ? '' \\n▁ he motioned around the room . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i said , taking a half step away from the other children in the hopes mr johnson might follow . \\n▁ this was n't really the place to discuss this . \\n▁ ` ` over there we have lacey and harry , and the other two from this group were charles and a three - year - old girl we ' ve named sophie - both in the secure wing . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what of the first group ? \\n▁ where are they now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` four kids have been adopted out to loving lilithian and vampire families , and it seems they 're all doing remarkably well . \\n▁ the other two are in observation . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ ross typed something on his tablet , nodding as he did . \\n▁ ` ` max and josh , correct ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i said , remembering back to the first day i came to the damned house and saw max playing in the sunbeams by the window . \\n▁ ` ` we 'd held high hopes for max . \\n▁ but , at night , when we had no control over the sunlight , he 'd become monstrous and hard to handle . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , we had to restrain him after he tore the hair from a little girl 's scalp on his first night , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` he was just too traumatised , and it seemed the dark only aggravated his torment . '' \\n▁ ` ` right , '' mr johnson said . \\n▁ ` ` and katy , your head psychologist , mentioned that charles and sophie showed signs of dissociative personality disorders . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , which may actually have been present before they were turned . '' \\n▁ he wrote something else down , and i checked over my shoulder to see if lacey and harry were listening . \\n▁ ` ` why do n't we take this discussion into the secure section ? '' \\n▁ david suggested , winking at me . \\n▁ ` ` yes , of course . '' \\n▁ mr johnson looked up then at harry and lacey , realising finally that we were n't alone . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ harry called , holding up a large rectangle page . \\n▁ ` ` look what i did . '' \\n▁ i left david and mr johnson by the security door and wandered over to the art corner , my eyes going wider when i got a closer look at harry 's picture . \\n▁ ` ` i love this , harry . '' \\n▁ i squatted down and pointed to the house sitting under a sunny sky . \\n▁ ` ` you 're using so many colours now . \\n▁ and , can you tell me - '' i aimed my finger to the red apples in the tree . \\n▁ ` ` what colour is this ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um . '' \\n▁ he considered the apple for a moment , scratching just beside his nose . \\n▁ ` ` purple ? '' \\n▁ i looked over at david . \\n▁ his smile grew . \\n▁ ` ` very close , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` but we call that one red . '' \\n▁ ` ` argh ! '' \\n▁ harry folded over his page , slapping his brow . \\n▁ ` ` stupid ! \\n▁ stupid ! \\n▁ stu - '' ` ` hey , '' david said gently , appearing suddenly beside harry , gently taking both his hands . \\n▁ ` ` do you want to know something , harry ? '' \\n▁ harry looked at david . \\n▁ he xxunk his king and wanted to be just like king david when he grew up , which saddened my heart immensely , knowing the damned might never actually grow up . \\n▁ but his love for david had allowed them a certain connection neither had with anyone else at the house , and david could always get through to him . \\n▁ ` ` when i was a little boy , '' david started , ` ` i always got the colour red and purple mixed up . \\n▁ they look exactly the same , do n't they ? '' \\n▁ his eyes slowly drifted onto mine , sparkling with a grin , asking me to play along . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m never gon na get this right , '' harry said , dropping his head between his hands . \\n▁ ` ` you will . '' \\n▁ david lifted his face again . \\n▁ ` ` because all you have to remember is that the colour red - '' he pointed to the apple , '' - is the same colour as blood . '' \\n▁ harry sat up straight . \\n▁ ` ` and you like blood , do n't you , harry ? '' \\n▁ david finished . \\n▁ harry nodded . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ david stood up , tousling harry 's orange curls . \\n▁ ` ` and if you keep getting the colours wrong , guess what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ harry said . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . \\n▁ no one 's going to hurt you , son . \\n▁ we like it when someone makes a mistake around here because it means they ' ve got another chance to learn . \\n▁ and what do we get when we learn something ? '' \\n▁ harry 's eyes lit up . \\n▁ ` ` chocolate ! '' \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ david reached into his pocket and pulled out a hershey 's . \\n▁ ` ` here you go , buddy . \\n▁ you learned that blood is red today , did n't you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , then you can have this . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , king david . '' \\n▁ he jumped up and threw his arms around my husband . \\n▁ and my eyes watered . \\n▁ i loved seeing the children happy . \\n▁ it was just so easy to make them smile . \\n▁ all they wanted was a little love , a little encouragement , and when given anything - didn ' t matter if it was a flower from outside , a pin from my hair that one of them liked , or a new pack of pencils - they were just so grateful it was heartbreaking . \\n▁ david patted harry 's hair , holding back his own tears . \\n▁ ` ` okay , see if you can draw me a picture of a puppy , and i 'll come back after i ' ve taken queen ara to see max and xxunk , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ harry sat back down and tore open his chocolate bar , leaning in to share with lacey . \\n▁ ` ` come , my queen . '' \\n▁ david draped his arm over my neck . \\n▁ ` ` i believe we 're invisible in the presence of sweets . '' \\n▁ my head turned as we walked away , my eyes staying on harry long enough to see him enjoy his first bite . \\n▁ ` ` you 're good with kids , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` kids are easy . '' \\n▁ he waved a dismissive hand . \\n▁ ` ` just feed them sugar and they love you . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure those principles will change when we have our own baby . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ he tugged me closer and kissed my hair . \\n▁ ` ` because she wo n't be allowed any sweets . '' \\n▁ ` ` any ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if she 's anything like her mother , no amount of sugar could possibly make her any sweeter . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw . '' \\n▁ ` ` charmed , i ' m sure , '' mr johnson muttered flatly . \\n▁ david shook his head , ignoring it , for the most part , and keyed in the code to the security door . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * the tall , lanky boy with sandy - blonde hair stood up as we approached . \\n▁ between us , a glass window sat as a divider from the hallway : a bullet proof , smash proof , and soundproof one that was mirrored on one side . \\n▁ max could n't see us , but we could see him . \\n▁ josh , however , had the finely tuned instincts of an adult vampire , a very old adult vampire , turning his gaze directly on us before we even stopped walking . \\n▁ ` ` how is he ? '' \\n▁ david asked , and only then did i notice katy had popped up beside him in her long white coat , clipboard in hand . \\n▁ ` ` he 's showing progress , david . \\n▁ we closed the curtains today while he was playing in the sunlight , and he looked up , but he did n't screech or back into the corner this time . '' \\n▁ david smiled , his eyes staying on max . \\n▁ ` ` jason asked to do one last session with him . \\n▁ what are your thoughts on this ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i have to say , i agree . '' \\n▁ she took one step closer to the glass , her loving eyes on the two boys as if they were her own children - the very reason we hired her and made her immortal . \\n▁ ` ` he has no memory of his past before he came to the house , but he 's showing signs of repression . \\n▁ i ' m worried it might all come back to him at once if we do n't dot every ` i ' , so to speak . '' \\n▁ ` ` and this present behaviour is what he commonly exhibits now ? '' \\n▁ mr johnson asked , peering into the room like max was some science lab monkey . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ she turned her head and smiled warmly at him . \\n▁ ` ` it 's almost like he 's a normal little boy . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what about joshua ? '' \\n▁ the stern man asked . \\n▁ josh looked up again . \\n▁ there was no way he could hear us , but i got the sense that he just ` felt ' us talking about him . \\n▁ ` ` we 're looking at giving him a position in the rehabilitation organisation , '' katy said . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i almost squealed . \\n▁ i 'd never even thought of that , but it just seemed like such a perfect position for josh . \\n▁ ` ` i think he 'd make an excellent carer . '' \\n▁ ` ` we think so too . '' \\n▁ katy nodded . \\n▁ ` ` he shows deep empathy and compassion with the children , and seems to have a good rapport with them , too , even with charles and sophie . '' \\n▁ ` ` with sophie ? '' \\n▁ i said slowly , my head reflexively angling toward the other two windows across the hallway . \\n▁ the lights were out in those rooms - the children preferring total darkness as they huddled in the corner , staring blankly at the walls . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ i watched him yesterday : he stood in front of the glass and placed his hand against it - '' she pointed to charles ' room . \\n▁ ` ` and charles walked over , slowly , at first . \\n▁ but then , he placed his hand against josh 's . '' \\n▁ david and i looked at each other then back at joshua , while mr johnson took more notes . \\n▁ ` ` does josh want to be adopted when we find a family to take max ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ he 'll stay here in the organisation 's employ until such a time . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and max ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we 're predicting another few weeks of counselling and training , but if mr johnson xxunk - '' she presented him . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll move max back into the house next week . '' \\n▁ i thought about lacy and harry . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure he 's stable enough ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i would n't move him if i thought otherwise , '' she said reassuringly . \\n▁ ` ` i love those kids as much as you do , my queen . \\n▁ i 'd never put them in jeopardy . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i clasped my hands and took a look around . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve done really well here , katy . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she smiled , looking in on max again . \\n▁ ` ` i think we all have . '' \\n▁ the gentle hum of david 's lungs expanding took my mind from thoughts of the day ahead to a peaceful state of sleep . \\n▁ the silence in the cavity where a heart should beat , and the warmth of his arms around me after my blood had fuelled his body , were two of the things i would never take for granted - having spent too many nights just trying to imagine what it felt like to lay this way with him again . \\n▁ but , despite the tight embrace i fell asleep in , as my mind rose from deep rem , i suddenly felt too much space around me . \\n▁ i opened my eyes and blinked until the blur wrapped the corners and the featureless walls of a dark room - the space decked out with a single bed , a table and a lamp , with curtains hanging over what victims who came here would assume was a window . \\n▁ it was n't . \\n▁ this room was designed to contain the screeching terror they 'd express when they realised this would be the last room they 'd ever see . \\n▁ but the cement walls and iron door could n't lock away the screams of the past . \\n▁ i could still hear them - hear every cry ever muttered , every whimper and every plea . \\n▁ the quiet prayers for mercy were embedded in the bloodstains on the walls - deaths by the hundreds having occurred in the one tiny space . \\n▁ and there were twenty more rooms like this , each one authorised by signature of the queen . \\n▁ with xxunk being so far away from towns or cities , we 'd approved for the vampires residing here to have their particular dietary needs shipped in , provided they disposed of the bodies thoughtfully and quickly , keeping all kills discreet and private . \\n▁ but , unless i 'd been xxunk on the menu as ` meal of the day , ' i really had no reason to be down here . \\n▁ i sat up fully and tucked my legs to my chest . \\n▁ the iron door was closed , probably locked , making the room as dark as it was cold . \\n▁ i always imagined these rooms were a little more inviting , maybe pleasant . \\n▁ but , then , how was a room of death supposed to feel ? \\n▁ being immortal had n't made accepting the death of humans any easier , and that was precisely why i had never come down here . \\n▁ ` ` hello ? '' \\n▁ i called , but it seemed like everyone had gone to bed . \\n▁ except for the shapeless figure i spotted in the corner . \\n▁ i held my breath , waiting for it to move - praying to god it was n't a dead body . \\n▁ not that a dead body would move , but … you know what i mean . \\n▁ it 'd be pretty darn scary if it did . \\n▁ my life story had gone from normal to vampire in just a few weeks , and i was n't about to start adding zombies . \\n▁ ` ` hello ? '' \\n▁ i said again , this time a little quieter . \\n▁ and the figure moved - just once , just a breath taken and held , then , it turned its head and looked my way . \\n▁ i pressed my back to the wall , making myself smaller . \\n▁ ` ` who 's there ? '' \\n▁ it said , easing my rapid pulse . \\n▁ ` ` jason . '' \\n▁ i exhaled his name . \\n▁ his eyes narrowed , searching the wall , his gaze sweeping past me several times . \\n▁ he shook his head at himself then and turned away . \\n▁ ` ` please ? '' \\n▁ a small voice muttered . \\n▁ my eyes focused on a balled - up shape between him and the wall - its skin reeking with the sweat of fear . \\n▁ ` ` please , do n't hurt me , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` shh . '' \\n▁ jason squatted down , brushing her thick , dark hair off her face . \\n▁ ` ` i promise , no harm will come to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you want with me then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing you ca n't handle . '' \\n▁ ` ` where am i ? '' \\n▁ she said , her voice calming a little under jason 's spell . \\n▁ ` ` where 's jeff ? '' \\n▁ the vampire looked off to one side . \\n▁ ` ` he 's … at peace now . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ her eyes went wide enough that i could suddenly see the whites . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's taking a walk through purgatory , '' jason said , cupping her ponytail . \\n▁ ` ` he 's looking for you there . '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ her voice quivered . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not going to hurt you . '' \\n▁ he yanked her hair , angling her head sideways to lengthen her neck . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just going to kill you . '' \\n▁ a scream split the seconds into minutes , the realisation of her own death sinking in only as jason 's teeth did , breaking her skin and severing the windpipe until the cry became nothing but a gurgled whimper . \\n▁ the thick , warm scent of blood filled the air , burning my nose and throat . \\n▁ i rolled onto my hands and knees and pressed my wrist to my nose , heaving . \\n▁ if this was a dream , it was an awfully real , awfully vivid one . \\n▁ i could smell the dirt on the floors , feel the chill of death fog the wintry air ; hear her screams like they were right in front of me . \\n▁ but it did n't fit - jason did n't look right in here - killing that way . \\n▁ i always imagined him to be the compassionate kind of killer - one who 'd make love to his victims and kill them gently , so they did n't know . \\n▁ i just never pictured him as an attack killer . \\n▁ but , for some reason , i found it oddly sexy - in a very twisted , xxunk kind of way . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ that thought just crossed the line , ara - rose , '' i said , pinching myself . \\n▁ ` ` wake up . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ jase stood suddenly , his arms falling by his sides as he slowly turned at the shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` in the flesh , '' i muttered awkwardly , sinking my neck into my shoulders . \\n▁ he checked all four corners of the room , his brow furrowed . \\n▁ ` ` ar ? \\n▁ you here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` over here , dummy . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ he walked slowly toward me , his eyes small . \\n▁ ` ` is … is that you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course it 's me , '' i said , but as i went to slap him , my hand went right through his . \\n▁ ` ` whoa . '' \\n▁ he stepped closer , the green in his wondering eyes reflecting the glowing orb of blue he was staring at . \\n▁ ` ` look at you , pretty girl . \\n▁ so lovely in blue . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my own hands , seeing them as ghostly fog . \\n▁ ` ` what 's happening , jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're dreaming . '' \\n▁ i waved my hands through the chilly air . \\n▁ ` ` some dream , huh ? \\n▁ it feels so real . '' \\n▁ he glanced back at his kill , echoes of her screams shadowing his eyes , and humbly lowered his head . \\n▁ ` ` you were never supposed to see me like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ he exhaled , wiping his wrist across his bloodied mouth . \\n▁ ` ` like a killer . '' \\n▁ ` ` you were n't that bad . \\n▁ besides … '' i looked over at the limp girl . \\n▁ ` ` this is only a dream . \\n▁ you do n't really kill like that , right ? '' \\n▁ his jaw went tight . \\n▁ ` ` what if i did ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what if you did ? '' \\n▁ i repeated playfully . \\n▁ ` ` would you hate me ? '' \\n▁ i laughed , rolling my head back . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ silly . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why would i ? \\n▁ i know what you are - i always have . '' \\n▁ he scratched his head and looked down at his shoes , taking a sharp breath through his teeth . \\n▁ ` ` then , i uh - i better tell you … '' ` ` this … is n't a dream , is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he shrunk into himself a little , as if my hand were waiting in the air with a giant slap at the ready . \\n▁ ` ` you 're outside your body right now . '' \\n▁ ` ` i am ? '' \\n▁ i looked at my hands again . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ you 're … you 're a wandering soul . \\n▁ you do n't even have a face . '' \\n▁ i touched my face . \\n▁ ` ` freaky . \\n▁ so , what do i look like ? '' \\n▁ ` ` blue light . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? \\n▁ 'cause i look pretty normal to me . \\n▁ just kind of see - through . '' \\n▁ ` ` like a ghost ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i looked back up at jason , but his eyes kept flicking over my entire body , not really fixing my gaze like they normally did . \\n▁ ` ` but i feel normal . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he smiled at me . \\n▁ ` ` but i really wish you had n't ended up down here . '' \\n▁ we both glanced slowly at the dead girl . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m really not that sensitive anymore , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` still … '' he said , and left it hanging , switching again to the light , carefree jase i loved so much . \\n▁ ` ` why do you always end up with me when you escape your body ? '' \\n▁ ` ` did n't know i did . '' \\n▁ ` ` well … '' he looked down at his shoes , stuffing both hands in his pockets . \\n▁ ` ` you do . '' \\n▁ i shrugged , but he would n't have seen it as a shrug . \\n▁ ` ` guess i just miss you . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i miss you too , little glow bug . '' \\n▁ he reached out and brushed his hand affectionately through my arm ; it felt warm and tingly , kind of like standing right next to the air vent on a heater . \\n▁ ` ` but you better get back , your colour 's fading , and i have a body to dispose of . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay then . '' \\n▁ i nodded , peeling my eyes away from the thumb he aimed at his kill . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll come see you later . \\n▁ i wan na talk more about this . '' \\n▁ ` ` you wo n't remember it , '' he said factually , turning away . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nope . '' \\n▁ he bent down and looped the dead girl 's arm over his neck . \\n▁ ` ` you never do . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * what david and i had done in this bed with each other over the past few weeks had surely ruined arthur 's turkey xxunk plan . \\n▁ i 'd held off as long as i could , but could n't exactly tell my husband i did n't want to have sex with him in case i fell pregnant and ruined his uncle 's and my plan to save him from certain death . \\n▁ so , i let him have me last night , all of me , and prayed now , as i laid here in his sleeping arms , that we had n't conceived . \\n▁ i wished it did n't matter . \\n▁ i wished i could imagine his life force moving through me , inside me , electrifying things to existence within my body . \\n▁ i wished i could cup my hand over my belly and imagine the colour of her hair , or if she 'd have his eyes or mine . \\n▁ what kind of smile she 'd have , whose temperament she 'd have . \\n▁ but all of those dreams belonged to normal people - to people who were human and not immortal weapons , whose vampire - hunting child was foretold to be powerful enough that one of the oldest immortals in the world wanted her dead before she could even say her first word . \\n▁ ` ` morning , '' david said sleepily , and all my thoughts halted , my hand falling away from my belly . \\n▁ ` ` hey . '' \\n▁ i rolled slightly to look up at him ; his stubble had grown in thicker overnight , making him look gruff and sexy , covering his dimple just enough that it looked like a ditch in the ground covered by grown - in grass . \\n▁ and under his thick , dark brows , pulled together slightly as he studied my eyes , those shining green emeralds stood out , brightening my day . \\n▁ ` ` i love the feel of your hand on my back first thing in the morning . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that so ? '' \\n▁ he spread his fingers wider , waking each inch of my skin he touched , firmly cupping my hip and moving his fingertips just into the rim of my underwear , a naughty millimetre away from my butt - crack . \\n▁ ` ` and i love feeling you in my hands first thing in the morning , '' he added . \\n▁ i giggled , pressing my head into his kiss . \\n▁ ` ` woke up on the right side of bed today , huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when i wake with you snuggled into me like this . '' \\n▁ he squeezed me . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't possibly wake in a bad mood . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , you ' ve woken up late today . '' \\n▁ i patted his chest and pushed off it gently to sit , tucking my legs to one side . \\n▁ ` ` breakfast is in ten minutes . '' \\n▁ he rolled onto his side , his body going long as he grabbed his watch off the nightstand and checked it . \\n▁ ` ` lucky i ' m a speedy vampire and can break records for getting showered and dressed . '' \\n▁ i copied his lively smirk . \\n▁ ` ` yes , but it 's a pity you 're not the king and can just decide breakfast is n't all that important today . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what , pray tell , is more important than dining in community with our people ? '' \\n▁ i moved one shoulder up shyly to my ear , and david 's smile spread across his face , his white fangs gleaming in the early light , warming my blood with a pang of hunger . \\n▁ but not hunger for the kind of food we 'd have in the great hall . \\n▁ ` ` you , my girl - '' he cupped my chin and slid his thumb down it , '' - are insatiable . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , insatiable and still bound to my queenly duties , right ? '' \\n▁ i said , knowing he was about to throw the covers back and get up to break that record . \\n▁ ` ` just as i am bound as king . '' \\n▁ he winked , and disappeared behind the bathroom door , leaving my bed empty , aside from the mound of proverbial duty i could n't escape . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * i 'd not heard a guitar being played in so long i could n't remember the last time . \\n▁ and i knew david 's style , knew before i even heard his voice rising above it that he was playing . \\n▁ but i was n't exactly sure who the second guitarist was . \\n▁ i wandered down the stairs to the great hall and crossed the room , hugging myself . \\n▁ the dining table was empty now , all the breakfast dishes removed and the people disbursed , but a small group was still lingering , settled on chairs in a disorderly circle beside the fireplace under the great picture of lilith . \\n▁ david smiled up at me , and i stopped dead , my jaw dropping when i saw jason sitting beside the king , the two of them in white t - shirts and dark jeans , entertaining the staff with their musical talents . \\n▁ they were actually laughing and joking with each other , the air around them charged with a very radiant kind of energy . \\n▁ and it seemed that , when it came to me , those two could tear each other 's throats out , however , take me out of the picture , and it was as if no conflict had ever arisen between them . \\n▁ which , i guess , was the way they had to be after a hundred - and - twenty years under the same roof . \\n▁ it kind of made me feel bad for coming between them . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' david said , tuning the e string . \\n▁ ` ` let 's try some jeff buckley . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine , but i ' m singing this time . '' \\n▁ jason elbowed his brother . \\n▁ ` ` otherwise we 'll get a pack of curious cats in here wondering what all the crying 's about . '' \\n▁ david reached out and flicked jason playfully across the back of his head . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ let 's do this . '' \\n▁ jason strummed once , getting a nod of approval from david , then started plucking the strings . \\n▁ i leaned my butt against the dining table , keeping my arms folded , trying my hardest to hold the grin back . \\n▁ i always knew david could sing , but jason was right - not about david sounding like a dying cat , but that he was a little better . \\n▁ jason had a better mid - range and his voice flowed easily from chest to falsetto . \\n▁ david had a more gruff , kind of sexy voice . \\n▁ both of them great , but also surprisingly different . \\n▁ the staff sang along with jason , clapping and dancing , united as equals for this small moment in time . \\n▁ right now , david was not their king , and jason was just his brother - the past we all shared just an inconsequential thing that happened once . \\n▁ the song ended to a round of applause , david and jason taking overly theatrical bows . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , folks , we 'll be here all week . '' \\n▁ david placed his guitar in its case . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' jason said quietly to a maid who took his guitar for him . \\n▁ ` ` good to see you two getting along . '' \\n▁ i clapped a few times as i walked over . \\n▁ both boys stood , and the staff quietly went back to work , tidying the chairs before they left . \\n▁ ` ` it happens from time to time , '' david said , kissing my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , when there are n't any girls to come between us , '' jason added lightly , winking at me . \\n▁ ` ` well , it 's nice to see . '' \\n▁ i rolled myself into david 's embrace , wrapping my arms all the way around his chest . \\n▁ i knew that scene - seeing the boys play guitar together like that - would stay in my memory forever : a rare file in the ` happy memory ' column . \\n▁ ` ` speaking of see , have you guys seen em or morg ? \\n▁ i ' m supposed to have another politics and boring stuff lesson today , '' i added . \\n▁ ` ` nope , '' david said , breaking away to close his guitar case . \\n▁ ` ` but if you find one you find the other . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , they 're pretty much glued at the hip , are n't they ? '' \\n▁ jason picked up his guitar case . \\n▁ ` ` you mean fused . '' \\n▁ david laughed , snapping his locks closed . \\n▁ ` ` i think mike 's got cause to worry there . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i asked , sitting on the last remaining chair . \\n▁ jason and david looked at each other then at me . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i repeated . \\n▁ ` ` you know what girls are like , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` uh , no . '' \\n▁ i blinked a few more times than necessary . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` once they get talking , a relationship problem becomes gossip , girls unite , and then a simple mistake sees us guys in the dog house , '' jason added . \\n▁ ` ` relationship problem ? '' \\n▁ i stood up . \\n▁ ` ` who 's having problems ? '' \\n▁ ` ` em and mike , '' jason said . \\n▁ david glared at him before looking at me . \\n▁ ` ` that 's her business , ara . \\n▁ do n't get involved . '' \\n▁ ` ` how can i not ? \\n▁ mike and em are my best friends , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he touched my shoulder and leaned in to kiss my cheek again , maybe marking me in some immature display of ownership . \\n▁ ` ` but it 's not our place to interfere . \\n▁ we 're not in their relationship , so we ca n't pass judgement . '' \\n▁ ` ` who 's passing anything ? '' \\n▁ i said . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m more worried about what morg 's saying to em . \\n▁ i think she has thing for mike . \\n▁ what if she 's advising emily out of the relationship ? '' \\n▁ jason gave david a smug grin . \\n▁ ` ` told ya . '' \\n▁ i looked at david . \\n▁ ` ` told you what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i told him you would n't get caught up in the drama of it all . '' \\n▁ jason stuffed his capo in his back pocket . \\n▁ ` ` we 're worried about the same thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` then i should go find them , '' i decided . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ david grabbed his guitar case . \\n▁ ` ` just … remain objective , okay ? \\n▁ do n't listen to too much of what em says about mike . \\n▁ you know what he 's like . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i know he loves her . \\n▁ i know he 's … '' i thought about it , having a laugh to myself for a second , '' - downright stupid when it comes to girls sometimes , but i ' ve also known him longer than she has . \\n▁ she ca n't xxunk him in front of me , i wo n't let her . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ david nodded . \\n▁ ` ` because that kind of chatter is infectious . \\n▁ before you know it , an argument she had with mike will become a full - scale cause for hatred . \\n▁ do n't let morg get inside her head . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , she 's good at that , '' jason added , and both boys walked away , side by side . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` hey , what 're you guys doing ? '' \\n▁ i asked , catching them on the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` sleepover , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` sleepover ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ morgaine stepped past emily . \\n▁ ` ` mike and em had a fight . \\n▁ she does n't want to sleep in the same room . '' \\n▁ i noticed em 's red eyes then . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay , em ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' she said , her voice still shaky . \\n▁ ` ` i just … you know what he 's like . '' \\n▁ ` ` um , no . '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he just does n't get it . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara wo n't either , em . '' \\n▁ morgaine wrapped her arm around emily . \\n▁ ` ` she 's his best friend . '' \\n▁ ` ` try me , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't listen to me , '' she started , and it all came pouring out with tears . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't understand what i ' m trying to say . \\n▁ he thinks i ' m being needy and bitter , when all i want is for him to want to spend time with me . \\n▁ that 's all . \\n▁ i just want him to want to . \\n▁ he does n't even have to , that 's not what i ' m after , you know . \\n▁ and i know he does n't have time , but … it 's just , maybe if he 'd meet with me for a coffee every morning , or even invite me , or maybe if he 'd spent time with me last night instead of going fishing with the boys , then i would n't be so upset . \\n▁ i do n't want all his time … '' she took a few jagged breaths . \\n▁ ` ` i just want him to want to be with me , even though he ca n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` how do you know he does n't want that ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ emily wiped her cheeks , angling her face away from me . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't show it . '' \\n▁ i sighed , dropping my arms . \\n▁ ` ` for what it 's worth , em , i do understand . \\n▁ and i also understand why mike does n't understand how you feel . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` he 's just … that 's just how he always was with girls , before he and i were together . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i ' m not just some girl . \\n▁ i ' m his fiance . '' \\n▁ she held up her ring hand . \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ if she thought she would be any different , she was kidding herself . \\n▁ she knew mike only for the curse - captured , obsessed version of himself he was with me . \\n▁ but that just was n't who he was . \\n▁ morgaine hugged emily close , rubbing her back . \\n▁ ` ` where 's david , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um , he 's on the phone to national security , dealing with some human issue . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , come on then . '' \\n▁ she grabbed my hand , keeping an arm around em . \\n▁ ` ` you 're having a sleepover with us . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` but no scary movies . '' \\n▁ emily and morg exchanged grins . \\n▁ ` ` knock , knock , '' david said softly , peering into the dark room . \\n▁ ` ` shh . '' \\n▁ morg scowled at him . \\n▁ he pretended to zip his lips , then tiptoed in slowly and crawled onto the bed between emily and i. ` ` what are you doing here ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` missed you . '' \\n▁ i reached down and linked my fingers through his , cupping my other hand over his wrist . \\n▁ ` ` what are we watching ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` shh . '' \\n▁ em jammed her elbow in his ribs . \\n▁ ` ` ow . '' \\n▁ he laughed and poked her back . \\n▁ ` ` chick flick , '' i whispered . \\n▁ he turned his head to look at emily , then morg , and laughed quietly , swiping a tear from em 's cheek . \\n▁ ` ` sad movie ? '' \\n▁ ` ` shut up , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` just because you lack the ability to show any human emotion . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m beginning to see why i stopped in the first place , '' he said playfully , then wrapped his other arm over emily 's shoulder and pulled her ear to his lips . \\n▁ ` ` what happened ? '' \\n▁ i was about to fill him in on the plot line , when emily 's lip trembled , and i realised quickly that he was n't referring to the film . \\n▁ my gaze went back to the tv set . \\n▁ i knew anything she had to say would be said in thought - not for my ears , clearly . \\n▁ she was so upset tonight , which could only mean there was more to this story than she 'd said . \\n▁ but , of course , she was n't about to xxunk mike with me in the room . \\n▁ i think she knew , deep down inside , which side i 'd take . \\n▁ but she was kidding herself to think david would side with her , either ; he and mike were two peas in a pod . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll talk to him for you , '' david said in that deep , whispery tone . \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` do n't bother . \\n▁ i ' m not sure i care anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course you do , or you would n't be crying . '' \\n▁ ` ` this would be so much sadder if they were vampires , not humans , '' morg cut in , her mouth full of popcorn . \\n▁ ` ` just pretend they are , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not crying , ara , '' david stated , removing his arm from around emily . \\n▁ ` ` you always cry in these movies . '' \\n▁ ` ` guess i ' ve done my fair share of crying for the next decade or so . '' \\n▁ he sat forward and looked at my face , sinking back again with a sigh . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you sorry for ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just … '' he scratched his chin , leaving his hand just under it for a second after . \\n▁ ` ` i just wish i 'd taken better care of you . '' \\n▁ my words were lost , and i think morg and em were so shocked by it , even they held their breath . \\n▁ i felt the awkwardness saturate the air then , as both girls slowly turned back to watch the movie , and david looked on with a certain amount of trouble behind that gaze . \\n▁ he was n't watching the movie at all ; he was lost in whatever picture of the past he 'd just apologised for . \\n▁ but we all looked up , morg pausing the film , when a loud rap came down on her door , and before she even got off the bed , the tension rose in the room with the scent of mike outside . \\n▁ ` ` hey , '' morg said , opening the door only a crack . \\n▁ ` ` hey . '' \\n▁ mike 's arm appeared on the doorframe above morg 's head . \\n▁ ` ` you got a sec ? '' \\n▁ ` ` uh , i ' ve got … company , '' she said , opening the door . \\n▁ mike 's mouth popped open a little . \\n▁ ` ` em , there you are . \\n▁ i was wondering where you 'd got to . '' \\n▁ she looked into her lap . \\n▁ i leaned over and whispered in em 's ear , ` ` what 's he doing here if he 's not here to see you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome to join us . '' \\n▁ morg 's voice rose over mine in an obvious attempt to shut me up . \\n▁ ` ` no , he 's not , '' emily said , coldly . \\n▁ ` ` aw , em , come on . '' \\n▁ mike took a step into the room . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be like that , you know i - '' ` ` mike , just go , please , '' she said , holding a hand up . \\n▁ ` ` you 're serious ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ what did i do ? '' \\n▁ morg , emily and i huffed loudly . \\n▁ mike stopped walking , looked at david , then me , then morg , and turned around , leaving the icy welcome behind . \\n▁ ` ` just give it time , em , '' david said as morg closed the door . \\n▁ ` ` he 's got a lot going on . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ the tension in her shoulders eased with david 's fingers softly tangling in her hair , rolling her head toward his lap . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just not sure i can always wait for him to care . '' \\n▁ i placed my hand over david 's for a second , then stroked emily 's forehead . \\n▁ ` ` we 're here for you , em . \\n▁ okay . \\n▁ you can come move into my room if you want . '' \\n▁ she laughed softly , closing her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll be okay . \\n▁ we just need a break . '' \\n▁ ` ` a break ? '' \\n▁ i said . \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i think he needs to lose me to know what it 's like to miss me . '' \\n▁ david looked up from emily , the deep concern remaining in his eyes . \\n▁ he really cared about her , and i always knew that , but now i could really see it too - could really see the connection they 'd formed through months being alone together , sharing blood . \\n▁ and he thought nothing of the fact that she was lying in his lap , her lips just inches away from a place only i should go . \\n▁ but it did n't feel as wrong as it should . \\n▁ it felt like … i do n't know , maybe like they had some deeper , untainted connection . \\n▁ morgaine sat on the chair again , leaning forward a little as though she was listening to me whisper a secret across the room . \\n▁ i 'd seen her do that before , when she was trying to get a feel for a situation , so i gave her a soft smile , which she returned . \\n▁ ` ` we ready watch the movie again ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ready , '' david whispered . \\n▁ morg pressed play on the remote , then came to snuggle up behind em , her head on david 's shoulder like he was some universal pillow . \\n▁ he 'd been a part of each of our lives once - in some way deeper than friendship - and we all owned some small claim to him . \\n▁ he was n't bothered by the closeness or affection of em and morg , and he did n't even seem to notice it bothered me , which probably meant i was looking into it too deeply . \\n▁ so , i rested my head on emily 's , and fell asleep with david stroking my hair . \\n▁ despite falling asleep in morgaine 's bed last night , david tucked tightly between me and emily , i woke in my own bed , with a pair of radiant green eyes smiling down from the vampire standing above me . \\n▁ ` ` what 's this ? '' \\n▁ i sat up . \\n▁ ` ` something you have n't had for a while . '' \\n▁ my eyes wound around the cup in his hand , steam rising from the contents , the warm smell of sweet coffee waking my mind . \\n▁ ` ` you made me a coffee . '' \\n▁ ` ` only the best for my girl . '' \\n▁ he sat beside me . \\n▁ ` ` did you sleep better last night ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i rubbed my head with one hand , taking the cup with the other . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't even dream . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he smirked . \\n▁ ` ` how do you know ? '' \\n▁ i studied him , pausing a sip away from tasting the first david - made coffee i 'd had in what felt like forever . \\n▁ ` ` what did you do ? '' \\n▁ he stared at the bed sheets , as if he did n't want to tell me , but the smile tugging his lips indicated that it was n't for any strange reason . \\n▁ ` ` i put you to sleep . '' \\n▁ ` ` what , like you used to when i was human ? '' \\n▁ he nodded , the grin growing . \\n▁ ` ` it seems that , with the power of a king , everything i could do to you before you became immortal , i can do again . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , so , are you as powerful as jason now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ my telekinesis is very limited , and i struggle to read the projected thoughts of a stronger vampire , like mike , but i ' m sure , with time , that will change . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped . \\n▁ i had n't expected him to tell me he could do that . \\n▁ ` ` you can read anyone 's projected thoughts ? '' \\n▁ his secret smile slipped across his lips . \\n▁ ` ` like you did n't already know . '' \\n▁ i sipped my coffee as a distraction , swallowing before saying , ` ` okay . \\n▁ maybe i was a little suspicious . '' \\n▁ he exhaled . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you just ask me about it then ? '' \\n▁ my lips stopped short of their next sip . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ ` ` let me guess , '' david said , sliding his arm between my neck and the pillow , cuddling me close . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't even think of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not that , david . '' \\n▁ i sipped the coffee again . \\n▁ ` ` it 's more like i just figured you 'd lie to me , or … '' ` ` or ? '' \\n▁ ` ` or ask me why i was curious . '' \\n▁ his spine straightened a little . \\n▁ i was sure he already knew how my curiosities came about - by talking with jason - but he did n't want to hear me say it . \\n▁ ` ` can … '' and here was something i was n't sure i wanted to know , but kind of needed to . \\n▁ ` ` can you read unfiltered thoughts yet ? '' \\n▁ ` ` on demand , do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i … i know you could do it randomly for a few days after the coronation , but , has that changed ? '' \\n▁ the birds outside sang a song to fill the silence , and the gentle breeze moved the still air . \\n▁ david took a slow breath , his eyes switching from thought to humour and back again . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ i can read unguarded , un - projected thoughts again , but - '' he said , but ended it there . \\n▁ ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ ` ` but … not always , and … it 's only yours so far . '' \\n▁ ` ` mine ? '' \\n▁ i sat up a little more , balancing the cup in hand so as not to spill the contents . \\n▁ ` ` why only mine ? \\n▁ am i weak ? '' \\n▁ ` ` is emily weak ? '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` i can read hers . '' \\n▁ hmpf . \\n▁ i turned my head quickly and sipped my coffee , focusing on the liquid . \\n▁ he just laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i love your jealousy . '' \\n▁ i half smiled into my cup . \\n▁ i knew what he meant , because i loved his jealousy too - the way any mention of jason made his blood change temperature . \\n▁ ` ` can you read jason 's mind ? '' \\n▁ he cleared his throat , sitting back a little . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` can he still read yours ? '' \\n▁ the conversation had clearly gone sour . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ my smile widened . \\n▁ ` ` i love your jealousy . '' \\n▁ ` ` i , my queen , do not need to be jealous of my brother . '' \\n▁ he took my cup and pushed me gently backward on the bed , a playful grin sweeping the anger from his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i have you . \\n▁ i married you , and i will never need to play against him for your heart . '' \\n▁ i touched his face , looking from his lips to his eyes . \\n▁ so many words came to my tongue , ready to roll off , tell him how right he was , but that sinking feeling - the one like i 'd forgotten a child in the car on a hot day at a supermarket - roiled up inside me . \\n▁ my eyes became smaller , focusing on it . \\n▁ i 'd forgotten something . \\n▁ i just knew it . \\n▁ and whatever it was , i needed to remember , because whatever it was , i was sure now , had something to do with jase . \\n▁ ` ` where do you go ? '' \\n▁ he said with wonder , his eyes searching my face . \\n▁ ` ` i wish i could read your mind as easily as i used to . \\n▁ i miss knowing everything you 're wondering and dreaming . '' \\n▁ i let my legs fall softly apart as his weight came down to rest between them . \\n▁ ` ` i miss it , too . \\n▁ miss everything about being human . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ he looked at my lips , his lovely dimple pressing into his cheek . \\n▁ ` ` because i can think of one thing you do n't miss . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this . '' \\n▁ he rolled the tip of his thumb past his index finger , tearing it open , and wiped the warm , sweet liquid across my lips . \\n▁ my tongue moved involuntarily , stealing the blood for itself , sending it down to the back of my throat . \\n▁ and that was it . \\n▁ i had to have more . \\n▁ david laughed as i rolled up and flipped him onto his back , landing on his hips like a cowgirl . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . \\n▁ i miss being human . \\n▁ i miss the sweetness , the , i do n't know , the innocence of our love back then , but i like this much better , '' i said , driving my pelvis down hard on his … zipper . \\n▁ ` ` and you do realise i ' m so hungry right now i could drain you dry ? '' \\n▁ ` ` go ahead , succubus . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` and i 'll flip you over after and take it all back . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that a threat or a promise ? '' \\n▁ i squealed , suddenly moving through the air , landing on my back with the pillows rising up around my ears , and david 's jeans scraping roughly against my bare upper thighs . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a promise . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , in that case - '' i thumbed a button undone on his shirt and traced my finger down his flesh from his throat to his sternum . \\n▁ ` ` come closer so i can bite you . '' \\n▁ chapter three i came over the hill , the midday sun bright and yellow above me , glaring in my eyes enough that as i set my gaze down on the basketball court , i could swear i saw mike holding a child up to the hoop . \\n▁ ` ` mike . '' \\n▁ he bent down , then tossed his hand in the air , waving it once . \\n▁ ` ` hey , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey , what you do - '' ` ` this is will , '' he cut in , presenting a small , blond - haired boy . \\n▁ ` ` he 's new . '' \\n▁ i stopped dead halfway down the hill . \\n▁ ` ` yes , we met yesterday . '' \\n▁ mike smiled at the kid . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll just walk ` i m back inside . \\n▁ two xxunk , ` kay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sure , '' i said chirpily , but my bones would n't move . \\n▁ who on earth authorised him to take the damned outside ? \\n▁ i mean , what if will tried to escape ? \\n▁ he could end up in all kinds of terrible places . \\n▁ mike walked the boy back toward the house , his hand on his shoulder , both of them talking animatedly , like they were best buddies . \\n▁ i almost did n't recognise my ` mature ' best friend and chief of security anymore . \\n▁ he even dressed differently when he came to see the dammed - always in jeans and a light coloured t - shirt , usually wearing a baseball cap , too . \\n▁ and i kinda liked him this way . \\n▁ he was fun mike . \\n▁ guy - i - grew - up - with mike . \\n▁ i reached the base of the hill as mike broke into a light jog back in my direction , bending to scoop the basketball off the ground as he approached . \\n▁ ` ` hey , baby . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey . \\n▁ letting the damned out now , huh ? '' \\n▁ he smirked at the quaver in my voice . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ who 'd have thought blood - hungry kids could get a release of energy from playing outdoors ? '' \\n▁ ` ` and … who , exactly , approved this ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david . '' \\n▁ he stood taller , clearly ready for a challenge . \\n▁ ` ` but not without supervision , and only one at a time . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' ` ` but nothing , ara . \\n▁ those kids , '' he pointed to the house , ` ` for the most part , are normal . \\n▁ you ca n't keep them locked away for the rest of their lives - '' ` ` but , i ' m the one who - '' ` ` even if the conditions are pleasant , '' he finished . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to agree , ara , but you - '' ` ` mike . '' \\n▁ i put my hands up . \\n▁ ` ` i agree , okay . \\n▁ i was just … '' he smiled sheepishly . \\n▁ ` ` surprised . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i did n't mean to start an argument . \\n▁ i think it 's great they 're going outside . '' \\n▁ i glanced over at the house to see all the little faces watching mike and i through the window . \\n▁ ` ` it 's just that no one told me . '' \\n▁ ` ` did n't david ? '' \\n▁ mike jumped up to dunk the ball in the hoop . \\n▁ ` ` nope . '' \\n▁ i strolled over and caught it on the rebound . \\n▁ ` ` he told me we had a new group , and mentioned something about education , but - '' ` ` did he tell you we decided not to feed them pure blood ? '' \\n▁ i frowned , searching my brain for that conversation , but it 'd never happened . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ why 's that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for one , they ' ve all been rejecting it , and - '' ` ` i know that . \\n▁ but , we were just gon na keep trying in the hopes - '' ` ` it is n't enough for them , ar . \\n▁ think of them as concentrated versions of vampires - they need more blood than an adult . '' \\n▁ he stole the ball from my hands . \\n▁ ` ` kind of like when vampires get hurt and need human blood because ours is n't strong enough then , either . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , what were the other reasons you decided against giving them our blood ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we do n't want them immune to pure blood venom . '' \\n▁ he threw the ball into the hoop , ignoring my sudden gasp . \\n▁ ` ` we left it that way in case you never find a cure for vampirism . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you 're just going to kill them if i ca n't change them back ? '' \\n▁ mike took a deep breath . \\n▁ ` ` we may have no choice . \\n▁ they ca n't stay that way for eternity . '' \\n▁ ` ` mike ! \\n▁ that 's horrible . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but it wo n't come to that . \\n▁ besides , '' he said , dribbling the ball , ` ` we 're also leaving things open in case one of them wants to die . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're giving them the option ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` they 're children , they ca n't make that kind of choice . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , those kids are older than you . '' \\n▁ ` ` not in human years . '' \\n▁ i stole the ball . \\n▁ ` ` yes , but they mature with experience and age , just like we do . '' \\n▁ he reached across and snatched it from my hands , throwing me a vehement glare with just a hint of a smile underneath . \\n▁ ` ` their minds are n't locked in childhood at all , like vampires first thought . \\n▁ and - '' ` ` i know , '' i cut in . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve seen them learn , show reason , integrity , wisdom , even . \\n▁ but i do n't like the idea of giving them the option of suicide . '' \\n▁ ` ` freedom , you mean . '' \\n▁ he turned away and threw the ball toward the hoop . \\n▁ ` ` huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` freedom . \\n▁ it 's not the option of suicide , ara . \\n▁ it 's the freedom to choose an immortal life or a peaceful death . '' \\n▁ i studied him carefully for a second before he broke the stare and wandered over to grab the ball from across the court . \\n▁ he was serious about this stuff . \\n▁ i 'd never seen him get so … red in the face , over any topic . \\n▁ ` ` why does it matter to you so much , mike - whether they live or die ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not that . '' \\n▁ he tossed the ball to me ; i caught it . \\n▁ ` ` it 's … i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i hid my smile with the turn of my back , and aimed the orange ball to the sky , throwing it but missing my target . \\n▁ ` ` you come here every day , do n't you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , no reason . '' \\n▁ i folded my arms , squinting up at him . \\n▁ ` ` one might just think you were starting to like those kids . '' \\n▁ he smiled bashfully , jamming his hands in his pockets , but it slipped away as he looked at his feet . \\n▁ ` ` so what was the deal with you lot last night ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i had coffee with morg this morning . \\n▁ she told me you all fell asleep on david . '' \\n▁ i took a step away and grabbed the ball off the ground . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` where was emily ? '' \\n▁ i passed him the ball . \\n▁ ` ` what 'd you mean ? '' \\n▁ he sighed , hinting the obvious . \\n▁ ` ` where , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , um , she had her head in his lap . '' \\n▁ ` ` exactly . '' \\n▁ he spun the ball around a few times between his palms , studying it . \\n▁ ` ` you all looked at me last night like i was coming to morg 's room for sex or something , yet em falls asleep with her head in your husband 's crotch , and no one bats an eyelid ? '' \\n▁ ` ` someone did . '' \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ he glanced sideways at me , the ball rolling off his fingertips toward the hoop again . \\n▁ ` ` you ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ he sighed . \\n▁ ` ` things are n't great between her and i , ar , but … i love her . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you ? \\n▁ really ? '' \\n▁ i asked in a flat but curious tone . \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ he bent down to grab the ball . \\n▁ ` ` she just expects too much of me . \\n▁ i ca n't be with her twenty - four - seven . '' \\n▁ ` ` or you do n't want to . '' \\n▁ he made a basket , his hands staying in the air a few seconds longer than needed . \\n▁ ` ` i … i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i grinned , trapping the ball under my toe as it rolled toward me . \\n▁ ` ` trouble in paradise . '' \\n▁ ` ` shut up . '' \\n▁ he copied my grin , elbowing me in the ribs after . \\n▁ ` ` just tell me one thing , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` sure . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you actually want to be with her , mike , or are you holding on to her like some trophy ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nice shot . '' \\n▁ he laughed , watching my ball go through the hoop without hitting the rims . \\n▁ ` ` and … yes . \\n▁ i do want to be with her , ara . \\n▁ but - '' his gaze went distant . \\n▁ ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ ` ` there are … things . \\n▁ i dunno . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i just … it 's not all black and white . '' \\n▁ ` ` so talk , '' i said , and mike walked away , taking a seat on the xxunk bench , with his head in his hands . \\n▁ i sat beside him , leaving the ball to roll off , coming to rest on the foot of the hill . \\n▁ ` ` when i spend time with her , she 's not even there . \\n▁ you know , i told her something really personal the other day , and she … '' he leaned back , looking up at the sky . \\n▁ ` ` she laughed . \\n▁ yet , when i told morg the same thing , she … '' ` ` she ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , she supported me . \\n▁ it 's like , i know you think there 's something with morg and me , but there 's not . \\n▁ she just … listens . '' \\n▁ ` ` she gets you , '' i said with a smile . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ but it 's not just her special talent , ar . \\n▁ she 's a good person . '' \\n▁ i nodded and looked up at the same place mike was staring . \\n▁ ` ` so , are you saying you want emily to be more like morgaine ? '' \\n▁ he laughed , catching the humour in my voice . \\n▁ ` ` i just want her to want me for more than the idea she has of me , if that makes any sense . '' \\n▁ i ran the words over in my head , interpreting them as best i could . \\n▁ ` ` you want to be free to be you , and have her love you anyway . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ but she 's got this image of me and what i should be , you know ? \\n▁ and it 's not me , ar . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i nodded , thinking more about the mike i grew up with . \\n▁ ` ` so , what was it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what was what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the personal thing you told morg and em , but not me . '' \\n▁ his lips parted in a breathy grin . \\n▁ ` ` it 's private . '' \\n▁ ` ` please tell me . '' \\n▁ i saw him considering it as he studied me in his peripheral , and i knew that , for the first time in so long , he saw me as his best friend again . \\n▁ ` ` i spend more time down here than i do at the barracks . '' \\n▁ ` ` hm . '' \\n▁ i was taken aback for a moment , disguising my shock quickly with a smile . \\n▁ ` ` you like hanging with the children ? '' \\n▁ he nodded , his whole body rocking with the movement . \\n▁ ` ` i get something out of this . \\n▁ i do n't know . \\n▁ i just … when i spend the day with them - teaching them things , playing with them , and i see the difference it makes - see them put what i ' ve taught them into practice or see them behave differently each time i visit , it … '' he stopped for a second to look at my face . \\n▁ ` ` it makes my life seem like it has a purpose . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ was only one of the hundred questions i suddenly wanted to ask . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he looked into my eyes then at my lips , probably expecting me to laugh . \\n▁ ` ` morg thinks i should change my career path . '' \\n▁ ` ` to what ? '' \\n▁ his hands tightened , a slow breath filling the lengthy pause . \\n▁ ` ` a teacher . '' \\n▁ my gut dropped . \\n▁ ` ` are you - ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he waved a reassuring hand . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not even thinking about it . \\n▁ you know i could n't leave you , but i … i like the idea , you know , that maybe this - '' he motioned around himself and my world , '' - is n't all there is for me . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what did em think of that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she thinks … she - '' he swallowed the lump in his throat . \\n▁ ` ` well , she said it was ridiculous . \\n▁ said i was born to be chief , and that i should n't be anywhere else . '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ i nodded , stalling for time until i could sort my own thoughts and opinions out from my fears and worries . \\n▁ ` ` morg 's right , mike . \\n▁ you ' ve always been the sort of guy who 'd be good at teaching . \\n▁ i mean , hell , you taught me nearly everything useful i know in life . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , shucks . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` b xxrep 4 u t … '' ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he patted my hand . \\n▁ ` ` i know you need me here . '' \\n▁ ` ` we wo n't always , though , mike . '' \\n▁ i patted his hand back until he looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` i think it 's great , and i think you should definitely do it . \\n▁ but , just … can you wait ' til this drake thing 's resolved ? '' \\n▁ he put his arm around my neck and pulled me close . \\n▁ ` ` sure , kid . \\n▁ i had n't made any plans to go anywhere just yet . \\n▁ you can count on me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i smiled , pressing my brow into his kiss . \\n▁ since the king took his place on the throne , so many things had changed around here , including our secret meeting place under the throne room floor . \\n▁ the plain wooden chairs that edged the round table before had been replaced by what looked like dark - wood artefacts from king arthur 's vault , each one square - topped , high - backed and identical . \\n▁ even the king 's and queen 's chairs were the same as everyone else 's , xxunk unity , david had told me , adding that the round table represented equality among men for the better of the kingdom . \\n▁ we 'd discussed brightening the room with modern lighting but , in the end , david felt it was best to leave things traditional . \\n▁ i guess growing up by the light of torches in sconces made him accustomed to it . \\n▁ but my new vampire vision had n't enhanced my ability to read in the dark , which was another thing that 'd changed since david returned from the dead : minutes . \\n▁ we now documented and recorded every discussion held in this room , unless spoken in confidence - the minutes jotted down in some giant , yellowing old book with a quill and ink . \\n▁ david had come down with a bad case of sixteenth - century - itis . \\n▁ and , now , i was stuck editing the a4 sheets before they were sent to the scroll room for insertion into the giant book . \\n▁ ` ` arrangements have been made , '' david finished , cutting mike off . \\n▁ ` ` i need you here to protect the queen while i ' m away . '' \\n▁ mike sat down on the long wooden bench against the wall . \\n▁ ` ` i am the head of security , david . \\n▁ it 's my job to - '' ` ` it 's your job to do as i tell you , '' he finished , looking back at the faces around the table . \\n▁ mike shook his head , yielding . \\n▁ ` ` besides , '' david added . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to oversee court in my absence . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ pretty much everyone in the room said . \\n▁ david sat down , his eyes moving past blade , ryder , quaid , then falcon , landing finally on mike . \\n▁ ` ` we both know ara does n't have the guts to do what has to be done around here . '' \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ i cut in . \\n▁ ` ` the men who were arrested last week for breaking human law ? '' \\n▁ he said , his brow arching to prompt my memory . \\n▁ ` ` so i let them off with a warning . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong with showing compassion ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not how things are done , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` now , more than ever , we need to show strength . \\n▁ we need to make examples of these lawbreakers and make certain their behaviour is not contagious . '' \\n▁ ` ` i think the fear of torture was enough to scare them into behaving from now on , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` if that were so , my love , they 'd not have committed a crime in the first place . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , '' mike said . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not undermining ara by ruling court while you 're gone . \\n▁ she has to appear strong and independent , and that 's more important than seeing everyone gets the right punishments . '' \\n▁ ` ` to show mercy is to exude weakness , '' david said , and looked at morgaine . \\n▁ ` ` i agree , '' morg said . \\n▁ ` ` but also agree with mike , david . \\n▁ you ca n't put your security chief on the throne to do your bidding when you have a perfectly capable queen . \\n▁ what message does that give our people about your faith in her ? '' \\n▁ david looked sideways at me . \\n▁ ` ` never mind that , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` what does it tell me about his faith in me ? '' \\n▁ david leaned his elbows on the table , his head falling heavily into his sigh . \\n▁ ` ` i have faith in you , ara . \\n▁ but you 're too kind , sweetheart . \\n▁ you let too many murderous villains off with a warning . '' \\n▁ ` ` well - '' i sat taller . \\n▁ ` ` i can be mean , if you want me to . '' \\n▁ he half laughed . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ prove it . '' \\n▁ ` ` o. . . \\n▁ kay . '' \\n▁ i looked at mike for a second . \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` there will be a case brought before us in court today - three men accused of murder in the human realm . \\n▁ i want you to judge them harshly , ara . \\n▁ i want you to make an example of them . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you want me to do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` same thing that was done before you took the throne . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you must sentence them to seven days ' burial , without comforts . \\n▁ no torchlight , no air , no blood . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , no . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he said sternly . \\n▁ ` ` they have to learn . '' \\n▁ ` ` but that 's barbaric . \\n▁ they 'll go insane . '' \\n▁ he smiled . \\n▁ ` ` lesser men have survived worse . \\n▁ perhaps they 'll come out better for it in the end . '' \\n▁ ` ` i have to say , i agree . '' \\n▁ blade leaned back in his chair , chewing a piece of grass he 'd smuggled in . \\n▁ ` ` blade ? \\n▁ you ca n't be serious , '' i said . \\n▁ he looked at emily 's shocked face then back at me . \\n▁ ` ` do you know what these men did ? '' \\n▁ ` ` did ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he sat up , placing the grass on the table . \\n▁ ` ` do you know what they did to their victim ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` they did n't just break human law , majesty . \\n▁ they broke our laws by killing in cold blood . \\n▁ they did n't even eat the man . \\n▁ they stabbed him several times in the chest and left him in an alley to die . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , is n't imprisonment enough , maybe twenty - five years ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for a human , yes , given that they lead such short lives , '' ryder piped up . \\n▁ ` ` but not for our kind , my queen . \\n▁ it 's laughable . '' \\n▁ mike stood . \\n▁ ` ` i agree , ara . \\n▁ you need to use scare tactics right now . \\n▁ once you ' ve established your monarchy and shown your strength , you can ease up a bit , but right now , people are looking for signs of weakness . '' \\n▁ ` ` so these men have to suffer so i can make a point ? '' \\n▁ ` ` there are many casualties on the road to freedom , majesty . '' \\n▁ morgaine bowed her head . \\n▁ ` ` their sacrifice is given for the greater good . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine then , '' i challenged , looking at my king . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll do it , but you 're going to walk those men down to the crypt and close their coffins yourself . '' \\n▁ ` ` a good councilman always does . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but you 're not a councilman anymore , david . '' \\n▁ i stood up . \\n▁ ` ` you 're the king . '' \\n▁ ` ` which means i ' m extending a courtesy to you by arguing this , ara . \\n▁ that courtesy ends now . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is n't - '' ` ` sit down , '' he said firmly , and the room fell to flat silence . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i do n't agree with this . \\n▁ i do n't agree that burying men alive is going to solve anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to agree . \\n▁ i am the king , and i have final say . '' \\n▁ my mouth opened to protest , but i just could n't believe what i was hearing , and the whole room seemed to stand still , as if no one had the courage to speak up against their king , even though he was wrong . \\n▁ ` ` in this monarchy , '' i said firmly , my voice not even shaking , ` ` the queen holds the power . '' \\n▁ ` ` not the way i run things . '' \\n▁ he stood up slowly , placing his hands on the table , and i finally saw what it was the people saw in this king - the reason they feared him . \\n▁ ` ` now . \\n▁ sit . \\n▁ down . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara . \\n▁ i ' m not kidding . \\n▁ there are ways things need to be done . \\n▁ you have a king because you do n't have the gut to handle this stuff . \\n▁ now sit and let us do our job . '' \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't allow torture . '' \\n▁ david 's stone face broke ; he laughed , waving a hand in my direction . \\n▁ ` ` take your idealism somewhere else , ara . \\n▁ i do n't have time for it . '' \\n▁ i swallowed , digging deeper for a little inner strength , and looked at mike , whose mouth hung open . \\n▁ this was clearly the councilman we had n't met yet - the david everyone warned me about . \\n▁ but i was n't surprised , not like mike . \\n▁ i 'd seen this david before . \\n▁ ` ` mate , why not let her try it her way ? \\n▁ if you 're right , the best way to show ara is to let her learn from her own experiences . \\n▁ she 'll never learn from being told . '' \\n▁ david stared mike down for a second , then turned to me , his eyes softening when he looked into mine . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ go ahead , but you 'll be taking us back to the stone age , ara , and when more vampires go ramped because there 's nothing to fear , we 'll be doing it my way , and i do n't want any arguments from you . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i whispered , nodding . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ now . \\n▁ missing venom stores . '' \\n▁ he looked around the room . \\n▁ ` ` what do we know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing yet , your majesty . '' \\n▁ blade sat back , linking both hands behind his head . \\n▁ ` ` the dawn guard noticed the lock on the weapons vault was broken at about four in the morning , and seventy per cent of the venom was gone - no fingerprints , no fibres or hairs . \\n▁ nothing . '' \\n▁ ` ` do we think it was inside job ? '' \\n▁ he looked at mike . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m looking in to that , '' mike said . \\n▁ ` ` and we ' ve got forensics on it , too . \\n▁ they 're combing that place as we speak . \\n▁ if anything 's to be found , they 'll find it . '' \\n▁ ` ` there 's one thing they ca n't find , '' quaid said , and we all looked at him ; he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` a motive . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i have a pretty good idea what the motive is , '' david said flatly . \\n▁ ` ` and i ' m damn sure we 'll be seeing those venom stores again - on the battlefield . '' \\n▁ ` ` for real ? '' \\n▁ i said , not really meaning to say it out loud . \\n▁ david looked over at me , offering a small smile . \\n▁ ` ` drake has threatened us once before . \\n▁ i ' m pretty sure he 's preparing for war , ara . \\n▁ and i ' m certain he will attack without warning . '' \\n▁ ` ` should we evacuate the town ? \\n▁ the xxunk have human children there . '' \\n▁ david shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` not yet . \\n▁ i ' m sending spies out to elysium tomorrow to keep an eye on things . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , last we heard , drake still had n't returned there , '' mike said . \\n▁ ` ` so , if he 's planning an attack , it 'll be from somewhere unknown . '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps . \\n▁ but we do n't have those kinds of resources elsewhere , mike , '' david said , meaning ` we ' as the set he used to belong to . \\n▁ ` ` drake needs the armoury at elysium if he 's going to attack . \\n▁ and when he returns to set things in motion , my spies will alert us . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine but , in the meantime , we need to find those venom stores . \\n▁ without those , all he can do is injure our troops . '' \\n▁ ` ` or kidnap one to extract venom , '' blade said , sending mike and i stiff . \\n▁ if drake came after anyone for their venom , it could only be either myself , mike , or one of my private guards - all people i cared about immensely . \\n▁ ` ` yes , so , with that in mind , '' david said , pointing at mike and my guard . \\n▁ ` ` i want you five to be extra vigilant . '' \\n▁ ` ` what about me ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't need vigilance . \\n▁ you have me . '' \\n▁ i sat back , rolling my eyes . \\n▁ if he kept up this high - and - mighty behaviour , he 'd be the one needing vigilance . \\n▁ i no longer feared the enchanted forest . \\n▁ all those tales i 'd been told about the trees imprisoning anyone who dared walk below their bows at the hour of dawn must have been lies . \\n▁ nothing like that had ever happened to me . \\n▁ but the rumour did afford me a kind of privacy at this hour i could n't get anywhere else , which gave me a chance to think about things i could n't dare think of at the manor . \\n▁ a bright orange orb glowed through the trunks up ahead at a distance , the dawn rising around the forest like a warm greeting . \\n▁ i reached out and touched the base of each tree i passed , a kind of unspoken good morning , and each one responded with a gentle tingle against my fingertips . \\n▁ the ground beneath my bare feet was covered in dry , summer leaves , cushioning my steps while the energy of the forest rose up from the platform of nature , electrifying every nerve within me . \\n▁ i felt alive out here . \\n▁ more alive than anywhere else i 'd ever been . \\n▁ there was no loneliness in this forest - not like when i visited the garden of lilith . \\n▁ no , out here i had the company of something not found within the border of the manor . \\n▁ it was as if nature had given up on that place - given up on the grounds , the people , even my garden . \\n▁ but ever since the day i swore in my own blood to protect the stone and everything under its rule , the need to feel the buzz of life around me had become like my need for oxygen . \\n▁ if a day went by where i did n't come here , did n't strip down to nakedness , or at least leave my shoes behind out of respect for those things living under my feet , it almost felt like i was trapped in a coffin . \\n▁ and with all the pain i 'd suffered these passing years , the last thing i needed was to feel buried as well . \\n▁ i walked on toward the openness up ahead , in search of the space and breath i knew i 'd find above the valley . \\n▁ i could breathe out here , but i could not escape the emptiness i brought with me . \\n▁ something was missing . \\n▁ some vital part of my mind or maybe soul had disconnected somehow , and no matter how hard i searched , i could n't find the time or place in my memory that it first occurred . \\n▁ but i knew something was n't right , and i knew that the bad dreams , the memory loss and this hollowness inside me was connected and that , somehow , it had something to do with jase . \\n▁ maybe it was as simple as my denied heart wanting him as a friend , or maybe it went deeper . \\n▁ i was n't sure . \\n▁ but i had to figure it out , whatever it was , for david 's sake and mine . \\n▁ as i reached the clearing at the stone of truth , the energy in the forest surged and raced toward me along veins under the ground , gathering and collecting in this one place , rising up through my feet to wake my sleeping cells , then trickling away again and returning to the stone . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and held my arms out , angling my face to the sky , while the whispers of nature filled the silence , making all the tiny hairs on my body stand on end . \\n▁ i could hear the wind kiss the thin edges of every leaf , could feel the small droplets of sunlight sneaking through the canopy , dancing intermittently on the bark around my toes , could hear the smallest insects crawling beneath the soil , and hear even the brush of a bird 's wing on the sky . \\n▁ this was my song . \\n▁ this was where i could plug myself in to all that i was , and just exist , for no other reason than to be a part of something greater . \\n▁ here , i could think clearly . \\n▁ here , i could focus on something other than the suffocating dread i had that something was missing . \\n▁ here , i could quieten my mind long enough to see the answers beneath all the questions . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk ? '' \\n▁ a child called . \\n▁ i slowly opened my eyes and lowered my arms , but as my gaze went to the stone , a flash of gold hair caught my eye . \\n▁ ` ` hello ? \\n▁ is anyone there ? '' \\n▁ a child 's face showed around a tree trunk ; her cheeky smile challenging . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ i called , but she ducked out of sight again - her high giggles echoing off everything around me . \\n▁ ` ` eve , is that you ? '' \\n▁ she ran to the next tree , her hair trailing behind her like gold ribbons , but when i came upon her , she was gone again . \\n▁ ` ` eve ? '' \\n▁ i called . \\n▁ ` ` please come out . '' \\n▁ i waited . \\n▁ ` ` eve ? '' \\n▁ she giggled again , this time appearing further away . \\n▁ i ran after her , my limbs opening up as i broke into a fast , human sprint , feeling the air expand my lungs like a breath i 'd forgotten to take . \\n▁ i followed her all the way out to the clearing by the lighthouse , glad i 'd decided not to walk naked today , and stopped dead . \\n▁ ` ` what the - ? '' \\n▁ trees had grown up overnight like blossoming buds in a time - lapse film , their luscious leaves casting shadows over the long grass , where the scent of apples and rotting cider wafted on the early fog , making sweet perfume in the air . \\n▁ i walked cautiously between the columns of trees , pinching the leaves on a few branches as i went to see if they were real . \\n▁ and as i came to a stop at the giant oak tree , centre to the orchard , i knew then that the child i saw must have been evangeline . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , '' she said , and my gaze went up the trunk to the tiny child sitting on the longest branch - one leg dangling down , her finger twirling a lock of hair into a curl . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing up there ? '' \\n▁ i stepped closer . \\n▁ she smiled and reached up to pluck something from between two branches , holding it out in her open palm after . \\n▁ ` ` come down , eve ? '' \\n▁ i offered my hand . \\n▁ ` ` please ? '' \\n▁ she smiled , but shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ why wo n't you come down ? '' \\n▁ the smile grew , her eyes darting from my face to something behind me . \\n▁ and a hand came down on my shoulder . \\n▁ i spun around and shielded my eyes , blinded suddenly by the high sun , seeing only a silhouette of a man there . \\n▁ ` ` jeeze , ara , i ' m sorry , '' jason said , helping me stand from the folded position i took . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't mean to scare you . '' \\n▁ ` ` you did n't , '' i said , feeling silly . \\n▁ ` ` it 's just the light . \\n▁ it blinded me for a sec . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` what were … what were you doing ? '' \\n▁ i looked back at the oak tree . \\n▁ eve was gone . \\n▁ ` ` i was … '' ` ` you have no idea , do you ? '' \\n▁ he asked , taking a step back from me . \\n▁ i stood with my mouth open for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i … no . \\n▁ not really . '' \\n▁ he laughed again . \\n▁ ` ` you were talking to someone . '' \\n▁ ` ` was i ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` what was i saying ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ it was n't in english . '' \\n▁ i felt my face pale . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ my jaw angled slightly away from him then , my gaze drifting inconspicuously to the field . \\n▁ the apple trees were gone - the fog and the cool and the scent of the orchard fading with it . \\n▁ i rubbed my head . \\n▁ ` ` i must have been sleepwalking . '' \\n▁ jase nodded , thoughtful . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing out here , anyway ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` it 's very early . '' \\n▁ ` ` early ? '' \\n▁ he looked up at the sky , then into the distance where the manor sat , its cream fascia rising up over the enchanted forest like a castle . \\n▁ ` ` it 's after midday , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ um . \\n▁ really ? '' \\n▁ i rubbed my head . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he drew both hands from his jeans pockets and walked over to sit under the old oak 's leafy bows . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' i said wistfully , my toes parting the long grass with each step , the temperature of the soil beneath it cool and moist as if the morning were new . \\n▁ i tucked my dress under my bottom and sat down beside jase . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i ' ve just got a lot going on . '' \\n▁ he nodded casually , reaching between us to pluck a blade of grass from its roots . \\n▁ ` ` wan na talk about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i said , but did n't talk . \\n▁ ` ` you know - '' he leaned forward , resting his arm over a bended knee , wrapping the grass around his fingertip like a green ring . \\n▁ ` ` i was thinking about you before i ran into you . '' \\n▁ ` ` you were ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` all good thoughts , i hope . '' \\n▁ he lay back , crossing his hands under his head , his feet flat on the ground just by my leg . \\n▁ ` ` i was just thinking how amazing it is that we 're both still here , you and i - that we can be friends - sit side by side this way after everything you ' ve been through . '' \\n▁ ` ` you mean after everything evil you did to me , '' i joked , gently slapping his bony knee . \\n▁ he lifted his head a bit and offered a sweet smile , that soft , jason smile that radiated the kindness in his soul . \\n▁ ` ` yes , and that takes an unbelievable amount of strength , ara , which is as scary as it is incredible . '' \\n▁ ` ` scary ? \\n▁ how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i ca n't even begin to imagine what it must have taken for you to survive what i did to you - both times . \\n▁ and yet you came out of that . \\n▁ your scars healed , your heart healed and , somehow , you found the strength to not only move on , but forgive me , '' his voice broke . \\n▁ ` ` wow , you 're really cut up about all this , '' i said , still making light of things . \\n▁ ` ` do you know why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i sat back against the xxunk trunk . \\n▁ ` ` it 's because you are capable of more than you possibly realise , ara . \\n▁ yet you do n't know that , and it breaks my heart . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw . '' \\n▁ i tilted my head bashfully to one side . \\n▁ ` ` no , i mean it . \\n▁ you … you 're like those fake columns in the throne room . '' \\n▁ i pictured the stone pillars marking the aisles of the throne room , sitting proudly as beams of support , despite baring no actual weight at all . \\n▁ ` ` how do you know they 're fake ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i hear you think of them a lot . '' \\n▁ he shrugged against the grass . \\n▁ ` ` and i think that 's because you know you 're just the same . '' \\n▁ ` ` how so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you might not feel like the pillar of strength , ara , but if that roof ever does cave in , you 'll be the one left standing , still holding everything together . '' \\n▁ i scoffed , crossing my legs under me . \\n▁ ` ` i doubt that . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't . \\n▁ i mean , if you think about it , you always have been . '' \\n▁ ` ` me ? \\n▁ no way . \\n▁ you 're thinking of david . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ he 's the hammer that nails the coffin , so to speak . \\n▁ no one would ever mess with him . \\n▁ but you 're the one they look to for strength , ara . \\n▁ because you exude it in every breath you take , and everyone i speak to says the same thing : they have no idea how you ' ve come to survive what you ' ve suffered . '' \\n▁ i lay down in the grass too , my toes against his shoes , bodies facing opposite directions . \\n▁ ` ` well , with you saying nice things like that to me , maybe i 'll start to believe it all one day . '' \\n▁ he crawled over and landed on his side next to me , smiling at the corner of my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` sweet girl , you already do . '' \\n▁ i smiled , too , reaching down to scratch the itchy rash on my hip . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ okay . \\n▁ maybe i believe that , but i do n't think i ' ve found any backbone yet to support my own opinions . '' \\n▁ he knocked my hand gently away from my skin . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know about that . \\n▁ i saw you make your own ruling in your very first session of court . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i thought back to that day . \\n▁ ` ` guess i kinda did . \\n▁ but i got in trouble after . '' \\n▁ ` ` so what ? \\n▁ as long as you thought it was the right thing to do . '' \\n▁ he turned my face until i looked into his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` be the spoilt queen if you have to . \\n▁ make your own decisions and know that we will back you one hundred per cent . '' \\n▁ ` ` some of you will , '' i said flatly , thinking about david . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he said sternly . \\n▁ ` ` all of us will . '' \\n▁ i looked up at the blue through the dancing leaves above us , trying hard to believe that . \\n▁ ` ` but what if i put my foot down about something , and i ' m wrong ? '' \\n▁ ` ` then we back you on that , too . '' \\n▁ he lay back again . \\n▁ ` ` but , you wo n't be wrong . \\n▁ you 're a smart girl . \\n▁ you just have to trust yourself . '' \\n▁ i pushed up on my elbow and looked down at his face ; his eyes met mine , all green and lovely , sparkling in the morning light , but the shadows made dark circles under them , showing how tired he was , how tired his soul was . \\n▁ i wiped my thumb softly over the sunken skin and leaned in to kiss his cheek in an innocent , friendly gesture . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , jase . '' \\n▁ he slowly cupped the small wet spot my lips left , a smile growing across his face . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't need to thank me for saying things you should already know . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , i do . \\n▁ because you 're the only one who ever does . '' \\n▁ he shook his head , still smiling , casting his gaze to the leaves . \\n▁ ` ` you know david will see that kiss in your thoughts , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oops . '' \\n▁ i cringed a little . \\n▁ jason laughed . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . \\n▁ it was worth it . '' \\n▁ ` ` worth a week in the dungeon ? '' \\n▁ he sat quiet for a second , then nodded once . \\n▁ ` ` definitely . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * i still had no clue if this scroll was a prophecy or a contract . \\n▁ everyone had very compelling theories either way , but no one seemed to know any truths . \\n▁ which is what brought me down here to the scroll room in the dead of night . \\n▁ i laid the yellowing document on the table in front of me , not bothering with tweezers to preserve the delicate , ancient paper . \\n▁ quite frankly , if it got destroyed , maybe all this nonsense would die with it : no more mystery surrounding its interpretation , no more possibility that either my daughter or me have been sworn over to drake , and no more plans for one of us to be killed on the stone of truth with the dagger of xxunk so the bad guy could steal our powers . \\n▁ and maybe , just maybe , it would put this nonsense of david dying to rest . \\n▁ but , i knew that removing the needle would n't undo the sting . \\n▁ ` ` argh ! '' \\n▁ i huffed , scraping a layer of ash away from the corner of the page . \\n▁ whoever damaged these scrolls had done a darn good job of it . \\n▁ there were barely any words left to read , and that was if you could even read the language of the ancients . \\n▁ which , i could n't . \\n▁ but i did still have jason 's sheet of interpretations . \\n▁ only , even his words did n't make sense if this scroll was a contract . \\n▁ it just seemed too melodramatic : a time will come for the pure one to rise . \\n▁ in her reign of light and hope , she will free the land from the fated curse , and bear a child with great power . \\n▁ i slid the other page of jason 's english translations over and held the candle up to them so i could see better in this dim , midnight light . \\n▁ the next line said , a child , possible only if conceived of pure ? \\n▁ - the question mark circled in red , because he was n't sure if the translation for that word was noble blood , blood of knight , or cleansed , since they could all mean the same thing . \\n▁ then there were the next words : born as and son . \\n▁ he 'd told me the symbol for those words had no translation - that it was similar to a word meaning firstborn , but also to one meaning disguised . \\n▁ i exhaled with a grunt and sat back in the hard wooden chair , propping my feet up on the oak xxunk under the table . \\n▁ how was i ever going to come up with an answer to this mystery if i could n't decide what i believed to be true ? \\n▁ or maybe that was it . \\n▁ maybe i had to pick a story and go with it . \\n▁ i pawed over the pages again , comparing the symbols to the english notes . \\n▁ ` ` need some help ? '' \\n▁ ` ` gah ! '' \\n▁ i dropped the scroll , blowing out the hard breath that almost became a really loud scream when i saw the familiar face . \\n▁ ` ` blade ? \\n▁ you scared the living hell out of me . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , good . '' \\n▁ he pulled up a chair and sat beside me . \\n▁ ` ` if there 's no hell in you , maybe i wo n't find you so hot anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` huh ? '' \\n▁ i issued him a dumbfounded stare . \\n▁ ` ` you know , '' he explained , rolling his hand around as if i might get the joke . \\n▁ ` ` because hell is hot . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ right . '' \\n▁ i looked back at the pages . \\n▁ ` ` well , sorry to burst your bubble , blade , but you 're bound by the curse of the original lilith . \\n▁ you 'll love me until you die . '' \\n▁ ` ` or until i fall head over heels for someone else . '' \\n▁ ` ` good luck with that , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` not too many worthy female counterparts around here . '' \\n▁ ` ` anything 's got ta be better than you . '' \\n▁ he nudged me with his elbow , flashing a toothy grin . \\n▁ ` ` yes , considering i may be destined for death - by - evil - vampire . '' \\n▁ he leaned in and peered at my sheets . \\n▁ ` ` hm . \\n▁ tricky stuff , huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i dumped the pages on the desk again and rubbed my face . \\n▁ ` ` you got any ideas what all this means ? '' \\n▁ ` ` a few . '' \\n▁ i turned my head to look at him , but he sat there , his face straight , hands in his lap , looking distracted or maybe bored . \\n▁ ` ` blade ? '' \\n▁ i said loudly , slapping his wrist . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he laughed , snapping out it . \\n▁ ` ` could n't resist torturing you a little . '' \\n▁ ` ` i think i ' ve had enough torture for one lifetime . '' \\n▁ ` ` ah ha ! '' \\n▁ he laughed , pointing at me . \\n▁ ` ` funny . '' \\n▁ ` ` more like distasteful . '' \\n▁ ` ` nah , it was actually funny , '' he said in that well - articulated english accent , drawing his chair a little closer to the lip of the table . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ so , prophecy or contract ? \\n▁ what is the answer ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think it 's a contract . '' \\n▁ ` ` as do i , pretty queen , '' he said distractedly , his eyes moving over the words . \\n▁ ` ` but , for what , exactly ? '' \\n▁ ` ` a child . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ a child conceived with a firstborn nobleman and a pure lilithian . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` and then again , we could be wrong . '' \\n▁ he looked up at me . \\n▁ i sunk back in my seat . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , why the big deal about all this ? '' \\n▁ he held up the scroll in question . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , what does it matter if we find the truth or not , really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it does n't . '' \\n▁ i took the scroll and rolled it up . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i just do n't like questions being unanswered . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , princess sherlock - '' he stood up and pushed his chair in , '' - you wo n't find the answers by looking at the same sheet you ' ve been looking at every night since david arose from the dead . '' \\n▁ i frowned at him , tucking the scroll under my arm . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve been following me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's my job . '' \\n▁ he spread both arms out and took a small bow . \\n▁ ` ` not at night . '' \\n▁ his lip curved into a sharp , sideways smile . \\n▁ ` ` i am your eternal servant , my queen . \\n▁ i am never off duty , especially when i know that you know you do n't have a guard on at night . '' \\n▁ ` ` why should that matter ? '' \\n▁ my lip turned up . \\n▁ ` ` what did you think i was up to down here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing bad . \\n▁ that 's not why i followed you . '' \\n▁ ` ` then why did you ? '' \\n▁ i pushed past him and walked into the storage room ; the musty smell of lonely pages was stronger here , closed in by the narrow aisles at least two vampires tall and twenty meters long , the shelves crammed tightly with scrolls and parchments . \\n▁ blade leaned his forearm on the doorframe above his head . \\n▁ ` ` i was worried . '' \\n▁ ` ` worried ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ about you - about how you 're feeling right now . '' \\n▁ he folded his arms . \\n▁ ` ` i actually thought you might be coming down here to cry in privacy . '' \\n▁ i gave a mock pout , grabbing a pile of scrolls . \\n▁ ` ` how sweet . \\n▁ but i ' m not that into you , blade , not enough to cry . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha - ha . '' \\n▁ he stepped aside to let me pass . \\n▁ ` ` but , seriously , i thought you might be upset about david . '' \\n▁ ` ` what about him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` about the way he 's been treating you , '' he said suggestively . \\n▁ i stopped walking . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' blade added . \\n▁ ` ` i notice everything . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's just trying to stamp his seal , if you know what i mean . '' \\n▁ ` ` i get that . '' \\n▁ blade walked over and pushed in the chair i 'd left hanging out . \\n▁ ` ` but he 's all high and mighty about it this week . \\n▁ he 's even hurt my feelings . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` he 'll get over it . \\n▁ i ' m giving him a gentle period of adjustment . \\n▁ then , i 'll kick his ass if he snaps at me in public again . '' \\n▁ ` ` is he … '' blade lowered his face but looked up with his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` is he like that behind closed doors ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i said , laughing the word out . \\n▁ ` ` he 's still the same sweet david . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` well , i ' m just lookin ' out for ya , is all . '' \\n▁ ` ` thanks . \\n▁ i appreciate that . '' \\n▁ ` ` any time , sherlock . '' \\n▁ he saluted me and grabbed the stone column beside the stairs , using it to sling his body around the corner and out of sight . \\n▁ ` ` morning , my queen . '' \\n▁ edgar bowed , placing a tray on the edge of my bed . \\n▁ ` ` morning , edgar . '' \\n▁ i sat up a little to look at david . \\n▁ ` ` where 's the king ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in the crypt , majesty . '' \\n▁ edgar wandered over and opened my curtains . \\n▁ ` ` he 's given permission for you to dine in bed this morning . '' \\n▁ ` ` the crypt . \\n▁ what 's he doing in there ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i believe he is carrying out the sentence he passed on the four men from new york this morning . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ! '' \\n▁ i shoved the covers back . \\n▁ ` ` i sentenced those men yesterday at court . \\n▁ they were to be put in the cell block . '' \\n▁ ` ` my apologies , majesty . '' \\n▁ edgar bowed . \\n▁ ` ` perhaps i am mistaken . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you 're not , edgar . '' \\n▁ i slipped my robe on and tied the belt around my waist . \\n▁ ` ` david 's gone behind my back . '' \\n▁ i charged forward , ignoring falcon 's line of questions as my feet moved over carpet then tiles then stone steps , following my memory down through the cell tunnels and the dark , chilly corridors that led to the crypt below the manor . \\n▁ row upon of row of caskets lined the walls like bars of gold in a vault , each one containing an ancient skeleton of loved ones passed , or victims of lilith 's hunger in the days she was alive . \\n▁ i 'd been down to the crypt only once - walked into the open cavern of the main tomb , and my blood had run cold . \\n▁ it reminded me of a great underground cave , the walls rising high into the air above , almost blue - grey , turning black where the cave went too deep to see . \\n▁ but you could n't walk through it . \\n▁ the cave went on forever behind a small brick wall placed as a partition between the floor and an endless drop into nothing - the same endless drop they lowered prisoners into when drake ruled . \\n▁ my steps slowed slightly as i reached the end of the tunnel , seeing the orange glow of firelight flicker across the dirt floor , while a hammering sound echoed off the drop . \\n▁ and right where edgar said he 'd be , my husband was fastening the last nail into a coffin - the other prisoners nowhere to be seen . \\n▁ ` ` david . '' \\n▁ i reached down and grabbed his arm . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what needs to be done . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i placed my hand over a soldier 's as he and another lifted the coffin . \\n▁ ` ` i made a ruling . \\n▁ i sentenced these men to twenty years in the first order 's cells , away from their homes , friends , everything . '' \\n▁ ` ` take him away . '' \\n▁ david waved a hand , standing up , and the soldiers shrugged me off , hooking chains under the casket . \\n▁ ` ` how could you go against me like this ? '' \\n▁ i stood back . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ david drew a long breath , pinching his brow . \\n▁ ` ` this is my ruling , and when you sit in that court , day after day , and see no more cases like this , you 'll thank me . '' \\n▁ the men hitched the chained coffin to the hook hanging over the depths of the sixty - foot hole it was destined for . \\n▁ i watched on , holding my breath , until david walked toward the crank that lowers the chain . \\n▁ ` ` david , stop . '' \\n▁ he paused , his shoulders high and stiff . \\n▁ ` ` ara , please do n't make this any harder than it has to be . '' \\n▁ ` ` hard ? \\n▁ hard for who ? '' \\n▁ i cried , listening to the man inside the box banging the lid , screaming for all the mercy of the gods . \\n▁ ` ` please , do n't do this . \\n▁ you talk about showing ourselves to be strong , a force to be reckoned with , yet you go against your own queen . \\n▁ how can my people respect me , if even you do n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they do n't need to respect the queen , ara , '' he said , then nodded to a soldier near the door . \\n▁ ` ` they need to love her . '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ i struggled against the man as he pulled me away from david . \\n▁ ` ` let go of me . '' \\n▁ ` ` you are the heart of this nation , ara . '' \\n▁ david placed both hands on my arms . \\n▁ ` ` i am the fear . \\n▁ they will not cross me again , nor will any other vampire , for that matter . \\n▁ and in my doing this , you ' ve not had to sentence men to tortures you 'll lose sleep over . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i 'll lose sleep anyway , david , '' i cried . \\n▁ ` ` please ? '' \\n▁ he wandered over and wound the crank , sending the last man slowly to the burrows of hell . \\n▁ ` ` david , this is madness . \\n▁ please stop , i ' m begging you . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is how things have always been done , ara . '' \\n▁ he turned to face me . \\n▁ ` ` they tested our resolve , and this is their reward . '' \\n▁ the man 's screams hollowed out , his scratching and clawing becoming an echo as the box hit the earth and the darkness of the past - the darkness david had become accustomed to , grown up in , xxunk to - rounded out around me , drawing me into both his world and his past . \\n▁ and i did n't want to be a part of that . \\n▁ i watched him shovel a heap of dirt and toss it ceremoniously into the hole , and i loved him and respected him as much as i hated him right then . \\n▁ i knew he was right . \\n▁ i knew if those men were allowed to escape with easy punishment , they 'd be back here in thirty years having done the same thing , as would many more over that time . \\n▁ david was the rightful king , the man who had the heart to get things done , even if those same things would break mine . \\n▁ but he was n't my david , right now . \\n▁ he was n't the boy i fell in love with . \\n▁ this david was something else entirely . \\n▁ i dropped to my knees as the last heap of dirt covered the vampire 's cries , and david came to squat before me . \\n▁ ` ` my love ? '' \\n▁ tear streamed past my lips , making my nose run . \\n▁ i wiped them away with my sleeve , refusing to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , ara . '' \\n▁ he stood up . \\n▁ ` ` i hope one day you 'll come to understand why i had to do this . '' \\n▁ i nodded , pushing up off the ground to stand . \\n▁ ` ` i understand . \\n▁ i really do . '' \\n▁ he stroked my cheek once . \\n▁ ` ` but i ' ve hurt you . '' \\n▁ my tears salted the air on my lips . \\n▁ i looked up into his loving eyes , and the hatred i had for him a moment ago trickled away , taking the anger with it . \\n▁ ` ` like i said , i understand why you did . '' \\n▁ he kissed my brow and stepped past me , nodding at the guard before leaving the crypt , his shadow flickering on the walls under firelight until it disappeared . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` blade ? '' \\n▁ i met him on the stairwell toward the eastern quadrant . \\n▁ ` ` my queen . \\n▁ how are you ? '' \\n▁ he touched his chest , bowing . \\n▁ ` ` i heard what happened . '' \\n▁ i stopped on the stair below him , hearing the screams of that man echo throughout my soul . \\n▁ my tears had dried , but i knew my face was still red . \\n▁ ` ` look , i know we should n't be talking alone , given the curse of lilith and all , so i 'll get straight to the point . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course , my queen . \\n▁ how can i help ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're the only one i can trust with this , blade . \\n▁ you ' ve always been on my side , and - '' ` ` what is it , ara ? '' \\n▁ he stepped down so he stood beside me . \\n▁ ` ` you can ask anything of me . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're good with the law , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because , it has come to my attention that i am of little value in this system - that david and walter and everyone else are calling the shots , while i ' m left to wander around thinking i ' m making a difference . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , ara , it 's not like that . \\n▁ you 're - '' ` ` no . \\n▁ it 's true . \\n▁ they 're so used to me being this inept little human , they have n't seen me become the vampire - the lilithian . '' \\n▁ i stood taller , rolling my shoulders back . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to tutor me . \\n▁ i want you teach me the laws , the ways , the things i ' m missing so that i can finally step up and play the role i was born to play . '' \\n▁ ` ` i thought morgaine was teaching you . '' \\n▁ i paused for a second , thinking about her lessons . \\n▁ ` ` i get the feeling sometimes that she 's teaching me only what she wants me to know . '' \\n▁ his brows moved slowly to pinch over the bridge of his nose . \\n▁ ` ` serious ? '' \\n▁ i hesitated only for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m serious . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you … '' he leaned closer , his hot breath brushing my hair with the scent of mint . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't trust her ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head , half checking over my shoulder . \\n▁ he nodded , his lips thin . \\n▁ ` ` neither do i. '' ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked onto his . \\n▁ he started walking , motioning for me to follow . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve had my suspicions from the beginning about her . \\n▁ i ' m not sure what the deal is , but i … i dunno . \\n▁ something tells me not to trust her . '' \\n▁ ` ` so … '' i walked quickly , trying to keep up with him , feeling a little uncomfortable in this quadrant of the manor . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll help me ? '' \\n▁ he stopped walking . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure you want to do this - stepping up , i mean ? \\n▁ it wo n't be easy . '' \\n▁ i thrust my shoulders back . \\n▁ ` ` if i wanted life to be easy , blade , i would have left drake on the throne . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah ! '' \\n▁ he pumped his fist then held his hand in the air . \\n▁ ` ` high five , girl . '' \\n▁ i slapped his palm . \\n▁ ` ` so , does that mean you 'll help me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when do we start ? '' \\n▁ he asked with a grin . \\n▁ ` ` tonight . \\n▁ after lights - out . '' \\n▁ ` ` perfect . \\n▁ where ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , um , meet me in the library at twelve , '' i said , turning to walk away . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be there . '' \\n▁ even though the table was only meters long , the separation between david i felt like miles . \\n▁ he sipped his wine , eyeing me the whole time , probably trying to get a grasp on my thoughts . \\n▁ but i had a mind blanket the size of manhattan quilting them . \\n▁ he was n't getting in , no matter how hard he tried . \\n▁ jason looked across at me , his shoulders sinking , and offered a sympathetic smile . \\n▁ and i looked away . \\n▁ with the mood david was in right now , last thing i needed was him making an ` example ' out of jason too . \\n▁ ` ` i have to say , i agree with walt , '' david said , and i looked up . \\n▁ ` ` if his contact says drake has n't returned to elysium , then i ' m happy to go ahead with our plans this weekend . '' \\n▁ walt nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i believe it 's best , your highness , to get these prisoners sorted quickly . \\n▁ there are more important matters at hand . '' \\n▁ ` ` like our missing venom stores , '' xxunk added . \\n▁ ` ` we 're looking into that , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` but we have n't got anything to go on . '' \\n▁ ` ` we could just call drake and ask him if he took them ? '' \\n▁ morgaine said , her tone light , joking . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , i still have his number in my contacts . '' \\n▁ everyone at the table laughed . \\n▁ ` ` actually , i ' ve sanctioned the help of our white canine friend , '' david said , sipping his wine after . \\n▁ ` ` he 's going to sniff out the trail . '' \\n▁ ` ` sniff it out , majesty ? '' \\n▁ walt raised a brow . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ david held back a grin , knowing how ridiculous it sounded . \\n▁ but it was actually a good plan . \\n▁ ` ` well , perhaps i may be of service then , '' walt added . \\n▁ ` ` i could follow the dog , take a team with me , and hopefully recover our losses . '' \\n▁ david nodded . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , walt . \\n▁ although , i ' m not sure we 'll find anything more than the route they took . '' \\n▁ ` ` much can be learned simply by knowing their method of entry , '' walt added . \\n▁ my eyes narrowed involuntarily , and i sent a little thought to david : so we 're trusting walt now , even though he 's only pretending to be blood bound to this throne ? \\n▁ he looked up , answering arthur then xxunk , and thought , i 'll talk to you about that later , for me . \\n▁ i shook the irritation from my head , biting my teeth together . \\n▁ one minute , walt was the traitor that infiltrated our council , the next minute he 's in charge of a very important operation , and david says he 'll talk about it later . \\n▁ how was it that i got left out of this loop along the way ? \\n▁ if things had changed regarding walt , i should have been the first to know . \\n▁ and this just cemented even deeper the notion that , as a wife , i could trust david with my heart but , as his queen , i could n't trust a goddamn thing he said . \\n▁ i sat back in my chair and aimed my gaze at blade , hoping he 'd catch it , but his eyes were small and smiling , lost on emily 's face as she talked with him across the table . \\n▁ even morg was watching them . \\n▁ ` ` what 's the deal ? '' \\n▁ i leaned closer to morgaine . \\n▁ she sat up , looking away from them . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , come on , morg . \\n▁ you know what i mean . '' \\n▁ i presented em and blade . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ she smiled in their direction . \\n▁ ` ` emily just told a funny joke . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i sat lower in my chair . \\n▁ ` ` guess i missed it . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's because you were n't paying attention , '' she said casually , scooping some food onto her fork . \\n▁ ` ` nothing new there . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes and slumped lazily on the arm of the chair . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * a fire burned bright between the windows , making the brown spines of old books glow orange . \\n▁ the tables were all bare again , the librarian having finished her cataloguing , and the room once again looked like a place of sanctuary . \\n▁ even arthur had taken up a seat by the long table facing the flames , instead of reading in his room like he had done lately . \\n▁ i wandered across and peered over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` what you readin ' ? '' \\n▁ he looked up quickly , flipping the book closed . \\n▁ ` ` my queen . '' \\n▁ ` ` human anatomy ? '' \\n▁ i frowned , xxunk my butt on the chair beside him . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he spun in his seat to face me , resting his jaw on his hand . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve decided to study human medicine again . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , we 're a society made up greatly of both vampires and xxunk , '' he explained . \\n▁ ` ` and with lilithian bodies retaining much of their human makeup , i figured a doctor who is versed in both vampire and human biology might be of some use . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` so , you planning to deliver a baby sometime soon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you saw that , '' he stated to himself , nodding . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ why are you reading up on reproductive systems ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was just comparing the differences in knowledge from the days when i was the most educated man in medicine to what they know now . '' \\n▁ he laughed , making a pile of his books as he stood . \\n▁ ` ` quite a few advances . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , just a few . '' \\n▁ i stood too . \\n▁ ` ` why 's the fire burning ? \\n▁ it 's only just september . '' \\n▁ ` ` it makes me feel more … human to sit here and read with the glow of firelight . '' \\n▁ i looked at the chair by the fire , the pipe on the arm , and the copy the hunchback of notre dame on the footstool . \\n▁ ` ` you used to sit here with xxunk . '' \\n▁ he smiled at the scene . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i wish i could bring her back to life . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , '' he said , picking up his reading material . \\n▁ ` ` let 's just focus on making sure i never have to say those words to you . '' \\n▁ i smiled as arthur walked away . \\n▁ ` ` night , arthur . '' \\n▁ ` ` night , my dear , '' he said , then tipped his head at the dark - haired knight who entered as he exited . \\n▁ ` ` blade . '' \\n▁ ` ` arthur , '' blade said casually , turning once to watch him leave . \\n▁ ` ` i think we scared him off . '' \\n▁ ` ` probably for the best anyway . '' \\n▁ i leaned on the tabletop . \\n▁ ` ` not sure i want everyone knowing what we 're up to . '' \\n▁ ` ` i thought you trusted arthur . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do . \\n▁ but i ' m starting to see why people around here place more distance on friends than they do enemies . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh ? '' \\n▁ he leaned on the table beside me , crossing his ankles . \\n▁ ` ` and why is that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because friends betray you in your best interests , blade . \\n▁ and there is nothing more dangerous than a person who is trying to protect you from the truth for your own good . '' \\n▁ the corners of his lips turned down with thought , his head bowing once in a nod of approval . \\n▁ ` ` you sure you need me to teach you anything ? '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you sure you need to ask that question ? '' \\n▁ he stood from his lean and wandered over to the whiteboard - stuffed neatly into a crevice behind a desk - and lifted it onto its stand . \\n▁ ` ` right , before we learn anything about the law or the ins and outs of queenly duties , let 's start with where you 're going wrong and why you may have the respect of your people but not of your peers . '' \\n▁ i looked into my lap for a second , digesting that . \\n▁ ` ` straight to the nitty - gritty , huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i see no need to waste time on small talk , my queen . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get started then . '' \\n▁ ` ` sit . '' \\n▁ he pointed to the chair . \\n▁ i sat down . \\n▁ ` ` now , first of all - '' he paced the floor , his hands closed around a whiteboard marker behind his back , that english accent of his more prominent in teacher mode , '' - most xxunk thing you do : tantrums . '' \\n▁ ` ` tantrums ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he grinned , making an overly dramatic point of stomping his foot . \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ that . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , that . \\n▁ a queen does not need to stomp her foot to get her own way . \\n▁ you 're on the right track , ara - '' he stuffed the marker in his back pocket , '' - standing up for what you believe , making decisions and seeing that people follow them . \\n▁ it 's what you need to do . \\n▁ but you do n't need to stomp your foot to do it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i never even realised i was . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he squatted in front of me and delicately took my hand until i looked at him . \\n▁ ` ` and , this is n't a pick - on - ara session , either . \\n▁ i just want to point out a few things that need to change if you 're to earn the respect you actually deserve . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i drew my hand back . \\n▁ ` ` so , no foot - stomping . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ and every time i see you do it , i ' m going to throw something at you , or maybe pinch you , '' he said , probably imagining it . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ i give you official permission to pinch me if i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` excellent . \\n▁ now - '' he joined his hands and stood up again . \\n▁ ` ` one of the other annoying things you do - '' i sat forward , listening eagerly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve watched you with arthur , with mike , even with david , and one thing i can say that 's consistent about you , girl , is you tend to believe whatever whoever you 're talking to at the time says . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 'd you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` there 's a lot of mystery and history surrounding our past and possibly shaping our future as a nation , and you seem to believe too easily what you 're told you need to do - or even to believe . '' \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` take this prophecy for example . \\n▁ what do you actually believe about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ i considered all arthur 's points , the things jason taught me in the library the day he translated the scrolls , and all the things morgaine had told me in the beginning - things i took as fact , that now turned out to be so far from the truth they were n't even worth remembering . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m leaning more toward it being a contract , not a prophecy . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what about the power of your foretold child ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the power to free the damned ? '' \\n▁ he nodded once . \\n▁ ` ` i … i think i can free them . '' \\n▁ i waved my fingertips in the air . \\n▁ ` ` and what about drake coming for your child . \\n▁ what do you believe about that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i believe there 's a reason he wants her dead . \\n▁ maybe she turns out to be the devil . \\n▁ i do n't know , but we ca n't just rule him as the bad guy because he seeks to kill her . \\n▁ i think we should have a heavily guarded sit - down meet , and talk about it all . '' \\n▁ blade smiled . \\n▁ ` ` and why has n't this been done ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because no one else agrees with me . '' \\n▁ ` ` and … who has all the power in this monarchy ? '' \\n▁ i sat straighter . \\n▁ ` ` the queen . '' \\n▁ ` ` precisely . \\n▁ so , i reiterate - '' he knelt before me , his elbow on his knee . \\n▁ ` ` why has n't it been done ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . '' \\n▁ i stood up , forcing him to shift backward quickly . \\n▁ ` ` i need a plan . \\n▁ i need to think about what to ask drake , and i need to organise to meet with him . '' \\n▁ ` ` but your people , '' he gasped dramatically , like a shocked old woman , rising to his feet , ` ` they wo n't like it . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , it 's my decision . \\n▁ i may be young , but i ' m not stupid . '' \\n▁ ` ` i think they 'll fight you on this . '' \\n▁ ` ` then i 'll damn well overrule them , '' i said , stomping my foot . \\n▁ ` ` ouch ! '' \\n▁ i swiped blade 's hand off my arm , cupping my sore skin . \\n▁ ` ` you pinched me ! '' \\n▁ ` ` you stomped your foot . \\n▁ try again . '' \\n▁ i walked cautiously away from him and stood across the room , looking out the window . \\n▁ ` ` a meeting with drake , in person , to talk - sift through the lies and webs in this whole prophecy - is what 's best for my people . \\n▁ war leads to death . \\n▁ and secrecy - '' i turned around to look at blade . \\n▁ ` ` it begets secrecy . \\n▁ i need to flush this out . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ so , now you believe that for yourself , what will you do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` tell them that 's the plan . '' \\n▁ ` ` tell whom ? '' \\n▁ ` ` my people , my council , my house . \\n▁ and they will go along with it , because anyone who opposes will be asked to step down . '' \\n▁ blade appeared beside me , the dark shadows shaping his smile . \\n▁ ` ` that 's my girl . \\n▁ and when they oppose you - which they will - what will be your immediate reaction ? '' \\n▁ i pictured myself in front of the house , standing at the head of the boardroom table , calm , taking slow breaths , staying silent until they all finished arguing around me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll whisper , '' i said , ` ` to get their attention . \\n▁ i 'll tell them this is the plan . \\n▁ tell them , including david , that i overrule them . '' \\n▁ ` ` just tell them ? '' \\n▁ he prompted . \\n▁ ` ` no yelling ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think quiet repetition should suffice . '' \\n▁ the corners of my lips pulled outward , making me smile . \\n▁ ` ` and … how do you know this is the right course of action ? \\n▁ how do you know i ' m not leading you into some trap , bending you to my will ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i trust you . '' \\n▁ ` ` you trust arthur . \\n▁ you trust morgaine . \\n▁ you trust - '' ` ` point taken . \\n▁ but … '' i exhaled softly , touching my chest . \\n▁ ` ` blade , i ' m following my own heart . \\n▁ often , when people tell me something or ask me to do something , i do it because i ' m trying to be the queen i ' m supposed to be , even if it feels wrong . \\n▁ but i do n't care about that anymore . \\n▁ i care about doing what 's best for everyone - for my people and my family , myself last . \\n▁ what they think of me does n't really matter anymore . \\n▁ so , if i do what i always think is right , then i ' m choosing who to trust , not just walking blindly , guided by every voice of reason i hear . '' \\n▁ he clapped his hands once , then again , and again , getting faster and faster until it was a full - blown applause . \\n▁ i took a soft bow . \\n▁ ` ` see ? '' \\n▁ he said . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't really need to teach you anything about being queen , ara . \\n▁ i just need to shine some light on what you already know . '' \\n▁ he touched my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a good person . \\n▁ you may take longer than everyone else to figure out how to rule your own roost , but i 'd take a good soul as queen any day over a judicial prick . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , blade . '' \\n▁ i hugged him , wondering if that comment was a stab at david . \\n▁ ` ` i think i just … it helps having someone believe in me , you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we all want to believe in you , ara . \\n▁ some of us are just afraid . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i sat down on the chair . \\n▁ ` ` it 's like falling in love . '' \\n▁ he leaned his butt on the table beside me again , taking the marker out of his back pocket . \\n▁ ` ` we need this - this queen , the safety , the protection , so bad that we 're scared , if we hope , it 'll all fall apart . '' \\n▁ those words rung true deep within me . \\n▁ ` ` i know how that feels almost better than anyone . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ and that 's why i know that , even if this not - yet - conceived child does turn out to be the devil , and that 's why drake wants her dead , you 'd kill her in a heartbeat - '' he held up a finger . \\n▁ ` ` after checking your facts , first . '' \\n▁ i nodded , smiling . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ fact checking . \\n▁ my new instant reaction . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ and calm breath , too . \\n▁ when you 're about to stomp your foot , just remember , you do n't have to . \\n▁ being queen means you are one big foot - stomp . \\n▁ what you say goes , pretty little thing , so do n't feel as if you have to yell and scream about it . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ ` ` well , on the bright side , i guess this prepares me for parenting , too . \\n▁ ca n't have two foot - stomping teenagers under one roof . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` we certainly ca n't . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * almost as if my stomach despised this as much as me , it groaned when i reached the field bordering the training hall . \\n▁ this week went by so fast , with so many things to take care of and so many discussions at dinner , i was n't really sure i 'd eaten anything human . \\n▁ i touched the back of my wrist , running a finger over the raised vein there , thinking about eric , wondering where he was , what he was doing . \\n▁ ` ` hey , gorgeous . \\n▁ what you doin ' ? '' \\n▁ mike said , catching up to me at a slight run . \\n▁ ` ` studying my veins . '' \\n▁ i showed him my wrist . \\n▁ ` ` eric told me that when they look like this , i ' m blood hungry . '' \\n▁ ` ` when was the last time you had blood ? '' \\n▁ he took my hand in his , flipping it over to look at my skin carefully . \\n▁ ` ` this morning . '' \\n▁ he laughed and poked me in the ribs . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m gon na call you miss piggy . '' \\n▁ ` ` shut up . '' \\n▁ i backhanded him . \\n▁ ` ` where 's david ? \\n▁ i 'll eat from him before we start training . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's already in there . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ cool . '' \\n▁ we both took a step forward , but though mike moved , i stayed stuck on the spot , caught by my lace under the sole of my shoe . \\n▁ ` ` how many times do i have to tell you to tie that up ? '' \\n▁ mike groaned , glancing back . \\n▁ ` ` crud . '' \\n▁ i lifted my foot and released the lace , ergo freeing my halted steps . \\n▁ ` ` you go ahead . \\n▁ i 'll meet you in there , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` from the sounds of that fight , i think david 's opponent needs some medical attention . '' \\n▁ mike grinned , listening . \\n▁ ` ` he 's up against falcon . \\n▁ this should be good . '' \\n▁ i smiled as he bounded away like a little boy heading to a mud puddle . \\n▁ ` ` sorry about that , '' jason said , springing up out of nowhere . \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` your shoelace . '' \\n▁ he pointed down ; it was already done back up . \\n▁ ` ` you did that ? '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i needed you alone . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they wo n't let me train with you . '' \\n▁ he jerked his thumb to the training hall . \\n▁ ` ` or even watch , because i ' m not a council or core member . \\n▁ but i need to be close when you shoot that energy of yours . \\n▁ i want to get a reading - see what it 's made up of . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , ca n't you tell david it 's for research purposes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i did . \\n▁ he told me i was n't to conduct any tests on you until the house had time to go over my proposal for the lab . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` so , do you want me to shoot a bolt out the door for you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if you could . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve got my equipment set up in the bushes just across from the doors . \\n▁ i just need about three seconds of that light . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll do my best . '' \\n▁ ` ` and … '' he looked at my face , right above my eye , and ran his thumb along my brow . \\n▁ ` ` do n't worry about the pain , ara . \\n▁ i 'll figure this out , okay . \\n▁ i 'll find a way to stop the headaches . '' \\n▁ i nodded , closing my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` you lost , xxunk ? '' \\n▁ quaid called out . \\n▁ ` ` no , i was just talking to - '' i started , but he was gone when i opened my eyes , '' - myself . '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing new there , '' quaid said with a laugh . \\n▁ ` ` so , who you shooting today ? '' \\n▁ i wriggled my fingers in the air . \\n▁ ` ` you wan na be my victim ? '' \\n▁ he stepped back , palms raised . \\n▁ ` ` it took me a week to get over the last shot . \\n▁ use falcon . '' \\n▁ ` ` ca n't . \\n▁ he 's fighting david right now . '' \\n▁ ` ` ooh . '' \\n▁ quaid looked at the training hall . \\n▁ ` ` come on then . \\n▁ we better get in there and help him . '' \\n▁ as we reached the entrance , though , mike and blade walked past with an unconscious falcon between them . \\n▁ ` ` is he okay ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , he 's fine . '' \\n▁ blade winked at me . \\n▁ ` ` king david snapped his neck as he went down . '' \\n▁ my eyes expanded to take in the horror of falcon 's lopsided head for a second , drifting slowly onto david after . \\n▁ he stood proudly in the mirrored sparring section , flexing his fists , looking kind of evil and very satisfied with himself . \\n▁ ` ` what 's the deal ? '' \\n▁ i stormed over and stood right in front of him , nearly slipping in the blood . \\n▁ he caught me by the arm and steadied me . \\n▁ ` ` what 's what deal ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why 'd you snap his neck ? \\n▁ we do n't spar like that here , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` relax . '' \\n▁ he turned away and grabbed a towel off the bench to wipe his hands . \\n▁ ` ` he 'll be fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , he 's gon na have a hell of a sore neck for the next few days . \\n▁ what 's gotten into you ? '' \\n▁ he sat down , breathing out through his nose . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't mean to snap his neck . \\n▁ i just … got a little carried away . '' \\n▁ i looked out the window as mike and blade passed . \\n▁ ` ` looks like a bad case of venting on the innocent . '' \\n▁ he half smiled . \\n▁ ` ` you 're probably right . '' \\n▁ ` ` so ? '' \\n▁ i sat down beside him . \\n▁ ` ` what are you venting ? \\n▁ what 's bothering you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we 'll talk later . \\n▁ for now - '' he stood up and aimed his voice around the room . \\n▁ ` ` let 's have a volunteer for ara 's target practice . '' \\n▁ while the knights murmured amongst themselves , probably drawing straws , i looked to the bushes outside the door , knowing jase was in there , watching . \\n▁ it made me feel better in some ways . \\n▁ david delivered my target to the centre of the room , and the rest of the knights took a giant step backward , blocking the clearing from me to the door - to jason . \\n▁ ` ` you guys might want to move , '' i said , parting the air . \\n▁ ` ` if i need to throw up after this , i 'll have to run outside . '' \\n▁ they parted quickly , and i caught the soft scent of jase 's breath from the small laugh i heard . \\n▁ i smiled . \\n▁ mike wandered back in and took his place beside david . \\n▁ ` ` okay , ara . \\n▁ today i want you to shoot him back to the wall , and when he 's down , i 'll be sending in a few more . \\n▁ and they will hurt you if you do n't strike them down . '' \\n▁ i looked at david , who eyed mike , disapproval trickling over his shoulders like rain . \\n▁ ` ` relax , '' mike said to david , without even looking his way . \\n▁ ` ` she can handle it . '' \\n▁ david shook his head and sat down on the bench . \\n▁ ` ` make it count , ara . \\n▁ i really do n't want sit here and watch other men beat you . \\n▁ and i make no guarantees that i wo n't step in again . '' \\n▁ i grinned at him . \\n▁ ` ` mike will kick you out of training if you do what you did last time . '' \\n▁ he sat taller , his concern slipping with a returning grin . \\n▁ ` ` then make sure you flatten them , my love , or i will make sure no one ever wants to spar with you again . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , shut up and let the girl spar , '' mike said . \\n▁ david laughed and issued a hand in offering of the floor . \\n▁ ` ` be my guest . '' \\n▁ the knight across from me looked nervous . \\n▁ he not only had to attack the queen in presence of the king but , if he did n't , he 'd be jolted with a bolt of really hot , electrifying energy that would most likely put him in a coma for a few days or , best case scenario , he pins me down , renders me unconscious and avoids my blast , then ends up with the king snapping his neck like exhibit a : falcon . \\n▁ ` ` shoot , ara , '' mike said , folding his arms . \\n▁ i looked at my hands and took a deep breath , feeling the charge rise in them , moving up my arms and joining at the centre of my chest . \\n▁ it vibrated , building there until , like water rising in a tub , gradually moved up my neck and into my head , bringing the tight sensation with it . \\n▁ i felt a bit like a pirate , with my right eye all screwed up from the pain . \\n▁ the knight parted his feet , scooping low to lunge toward me , and time slowed down . \\n▁ i held my breath and forced the heat from my palms , imagining it going into the knight 's chest . \\n▁ and as usual , it did . \\n▁ i never felt as if i had any control over it . \\n▁ i felt it leave my body , felt it hit him and ignite his shirt , felt the heat , felt his pain , heard his scream , but did n't feel as though i did it . \\n▁ it was more like watching it on a screen in front of me . \\n▁ then , the pain set in . \\n▁ i dropped my hands , the static ceasing , and grabbed my temples . \\n▁ ` ` keep going , ara , '' mike ordered . \\n▁ ` ` that was n't even two seconds . '' \\n▁ ` ` ah ! '' \\n▁ i bit my teeth together , vaguely noticing a knight come at me from the side ; my eyes darted to david , who stood , then back to the knight . \\n▁ if i did n't shoot this guy , david would do much worse . \\n▁ i sent a bolt in his direction . \\n▁ it was small and did nothing but make him shake . \\n▁ he dusted his chest off and came at me again . \\n▁ ` ` two more men , '' mike called , and the fight was over . \\n▁ i was surrounded . \\n▁ my heels slipped in falcon 's blood as i turned to run , sending me in a sideways skid until i landed against the mirror beside me , and all the pain in my head shifted suddenly to the right , making my jaw fall open . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ david walked closer , his hand out . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ as i looked up to answer , three men shoved past him , diving in my direction . \\n▁ i shut my eyes tight and aimed again , focusing , trying harder to make this one count , and as i felt the light go through a chest , i flicked my hand outward , pushing it in jason 's direction . \\n▁ ` ` holy shit ! '' \\n▁ mike said , and a whole room full of xxunk gasps followed . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ my eyes flung open , but instead of sixty faces staring at me , they were all staring at the bushes outside - the knight lying in a tangled heap among them . \\n▁ ` ` did i do that ? '' \\n▁ i rolled up to stand , searching for jason . \\n▁ mike and several others ran over to the frying knight , and david 's hand came down on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` my love , are you okay ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , but i was n't okay . \\n▁ ` ` stand straight , '' he said , trying to help me . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't . '' \\n▁ my knees wobbled . \\n▁ ` ` it 's really bad . \\n▁ what happened out there ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you threw him . \\n▁ you picked him up about three feet off the ground and ditched him outside . '' \\n▁ ` ` how is that possible ? '' \\n▁ i looked on as they rescued the man and helped him to his feet . \\n▁ ` ` it 's static electricity , is n't it ? \\n▁ how can i possibly move things with it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ he hugged me close to his bare chest ; it was the first time i 'd felt his skin against my cheek in a few days , and it made me take a quick breath . \\n▁ ` ` you okay , my love ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i just forgot how nice our skin felt together . '' \\n▁ he looked down lovingly , but his hand came up quick , gently wiping under my nose as the salty taste of my own blood fell onto my lip . \\n▁ ` ` i think we might ' ve pushed you too hard . '' \\n▁ i touched the blood . \\n▁ ` ` my head feels cold . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' mike said , clapping his hands once . \\n▁ ` ` one more round and we 'll call it quits for the day . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 's bleeding , mike . '' \\n▁ david turned me around . \\n▁ mike stopped in his tracks . \\n▁ ` ` ara , what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david punched me , '' i joked . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ he licked his thumb and wiped it across my lip . \\n▁ ` ` do you want to lie down for a minute ? '' \\n▁ i did want to , but i wanted to get this training session over with more . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i ' m okay . \\n▁ i ' m getting stronger , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ mike laughed . \\n▁ ` ` quite a bit stronger . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay then . '' \\n▁ i stepped away from david 's arms ; the pain had moved to the base of my skull now , slowly retreating down my spine . \\n▁ ` ` who 's next ? '' \\n▁ mike , david said in his thoughts , his tone coming through with that cheeky smile i just knew he was wearing . \\n▁ i grinned , rubbed my hands together , and as i wiped them away , flung a bolt at mike . \\n▁ he cried out as he went down , clutching his arm . \\n▁ david laughed loudly , slapping his knee , paralysed by hilarity . \\n▁ so i sent one at him , but he ducked , sweeping forward in a quick move , grabbing me at the waist and flipping me up into his arms like a damsel in distress . \\n▁ ` ` nice try . '' \\n▁ ` ` how 'd you know i was gon na do that ? '' \\n▁ i asked , ignoring the searing in my brain . \\n▁ ` ` i can read your mind , pretty girl . \\n▁ even if i ca n't actually read it right now . '' \\n▁ i laughed , but as the jiggle from my stomach moved up to my chest , the pain shifted again , pushing out on both sides of my head in a pressure - building explosion , just waiting to erupt . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ he laid me on the ground ; mike stumbled to his feet , muttering something about revenge , and came to kneel beside me . \\n▁ ` ` lay her on her side . '' \\n▁ his big hands cupped my ribs and he flipped me over , placing a shirt under my head . \\n▁ ` ` trent , get that stuff arthur gave us . '' \\n▁ i could n't open my eyes , but i felt david there beside me , felt his hand on my brow , heard his words in my ear while he soothingly rubbed my body and stroked my hair . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` yes , my love … my love … love … '' ` ` just stay . \\n▁ do n't go . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not going anywhere … where … where … '' the dry scent of cinnamon and xxunk and number of other herbs filled my head , taking out all the volume and the ringing in my ears . \\n▁ i knew what was next . \\n▁ i held my breath , waiting for it to travel into my lungs and spin my world around , taking me down to the darkness for the next eight hours . \\n▁ ` ` love you , '' i whispered with the breath i 'd held . \\n▁ chapter four i ran down the stairs , catching jason 's sleeve as he reached for the front door . \\n▁ ` ` hey , did you hear ? '' \\n▁ ` ` about the labs ? '' \\n▁ he said solemnly . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i stepped back a little . \\n▁ ` ` i thought you 'd be a bit happier . '' \\n▁ he frowned , making his eyes smaller . \\n▁ ` ` he did n't tell you , did he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` who did n't tell me what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the king approved a lab and greenhouse on the rooftop for arthur , '' he said spitefully . \\n▁ ` ` but declined my proposal . '' \\n▁ i sunk back on my heels . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he smirked . \\n▁ ` ` a scientific study into the possibility of you being the power to free the damned would involve long hours of time spent in each other 's company . '' \\n▁ he started walking away . \\n▁ ` ` why do you think he disapproved it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , jase , '' i called . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll talk to him . '' \\n▁ he turned back as he reached the door . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve known him for over a hundred years , ara . \\n▁ if even the prospect of freeing the damned could n't change his mind , you wo n't have a hope in hell . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` david ! '' \\n▁ he spun around , placing his book down on the dresser as his smile dropped . \\n▁ ` ` my love , what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you are what 's wrong . '' \\n▁ i poked his chest , coming to stop beside him as the bedroom door slammed shut . \\n▁ ` ` why did you deny jason 's proposal for a lab ? '' \\n▁ he turned away , groaning . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not necessary . '' \\n▁ ` ` not necessary ? \\n▁ not necessary . '' \\n▁ i grabbed his arm and made him turn back to me . \\n▁ ` ` david , we need to study my powers . \\n▁ we - '' ` ` mike is doing fine with what he 's got going on in the training hall . \\n▁ i ' ve seen his notes . '' \\n▁ ` ` his notes ! \\n▁ so you ' ve seen how every time he put me in that cage , every time he makes me shoot things , i practically go into a coma for the next eight hours in excruciating pain ! \\n▁ and you think this is okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` like he says , you just need to exercise it . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you kidding me ? \\n▁ david . '' \\n▁ i stopped , taking a few deep breaths . \\n▁ ` ` it starts hearts . '' \\n▁ i held up my hand . \\n▁ ` ` what if it can turn a vampire back to a human ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know if i believe in that anymore , ara . '' \\n▁ my eyes welled with hot tears . \\n▁ ` ` but what if i do ? '' \\n▁ he sighed , taking both my arms . \\n▁ ` ` my love , there are more important things to worry about now . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' ` ` i do n't want to hear any more . \\n▁ look - '' he kissed my forehead , swiping a cold tear from my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` maybe once this business with drake is put to rest , i 'll approve a research division . \\n▁ okay ? \\n▁ but not now . \\n▁ not while we have so many other things to focus on . '' \\n▁ ` ` but it would n't be a problem for you . \\n▁ this is on jason - it 's his project . \\n▁ he wo n't get in your way , '' i said , hopeful . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not open for discussion . '' \\n▁ ` ` but … '' i followed him across the room . \\n▁ ` ` if you 're worried about he and i being alone , you can put a guard on me . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` ara , please . \\n▁ i ' m trying to pack . \\n▁ can you … '' he pinched the bridge of his nose . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll discuss this when i return from elysium on monday . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , we wo n't . '' \\n▁ i spun away . \\n▁ ` ` you 're just brushing it off , like you always do . '' \\n▁ he appeared behind me , his fingers grasping my arm . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get something monumentally clear here , my dear , sweet girl . \\n▁ i brush nothing off . \\n▁ and , yeah , maybe i ' m hesitant to discuss this with you , because there 's nothing to discuss . \\n▁ i wo n't approve a lab for jason as a guise for him to spend time alone with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not what it is . \\n▁ do you have no faith in him at all ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not when it comes to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` yet you trust arthur , '' i said spitefully . \\n▁ ` ` what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n▁ i wanted to say that if he was worried about anyone trying to have sex with me , it should be his uncle , not jason , but i was pretty sure that would result in arthur 's death . \\n▁ and as i looked up into his troubled eyes , the exhaustion of everything came down on top of me . \\n▁ my lip quivered . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't do this anymore , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` what , my love ? '' \\n▁ he pulled me close , my nice , loving david returning . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i know you do n't want jason and i to hang out , but he 's trying to find a way to make my pain stop . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not going to stop , ara . \\n▁ he 's putting ideas into your head . '' \\n▁ ` ` is he ? \\n▁ or is it that you do n't want me to have any friends ? '' \\n▁ ` ` how can you say something like that ? '' \\n▁ he pulled away . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not that sort of man , ara , you know that . '' \\n▁ ` ` do i ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , please ? '' \\n▁ his tone broke at the same time as his heart . \\n▁ ` ` david , '' i said , exhaling . \\n▁ ` ` jason is my only real friend . \\n▁ he 's the only one in this whole place who has my back , no matter what i do wrong . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? \\n▁ what about me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ you 're lying to me all the time . \\n▁ i ca n't trust anything you say . '' \\n▁ ` ` lying ? '' \\n▁ the skin on his forehead moved downward , bunching into a frown . \\n▁ ` ` ara , what makes you think i ' m lying to you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so many things . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , laughing to myself . \\n▁ ` ` my love , please . \\n▁ talk to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , for one , you told me i descended from evangeline 's bloodline , and now you tell me she died as a child , and you told me - '' ` ` hold on . '' \\n▁ he put a finger up . \\n▁ ` ` when i told you that story , i believed it to be correct . \\n▁ all i had learned came from lilithian history books in our library . \\n▁ i told you what i knew to be the truth . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he brushed my hair off my face . \\n▁ ` ` and these are n't the only half - truths we ' ve all been told . \\n▁ you have to trust me , ara . \\n▁ i did not tell you those stories to steer you in the wrong direction . \\n▁ if anything , ask arthur why he never told you the truth . \\n▁ ask him , or any other high vampire councillor , why they never corrected myself or any other vampire . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , you see ? \\n▁ that 's just it . \\n▁ everyone keeps the truth so buried no one even knows what 's true anymore . \\n▁ i mean , i came here believing drake took revenge on all xxunk because lilith wanted to kill him , and now i ' m told it 's because lilith killed anandene . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ anandene left drake - betrayed him . \\n▁ she ran off with one of the council leaders . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not what arthur told me . '' \\n▁ david looked down at his clasped hands , frowning . \\n▁ ` ` what else did he tell you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he told me not to discuss this with anyone . '' \\n▁ his lip tugged on one side , making his whole face softer with that smile . \\n▁ ` ` you can tell me . \\n▁ i ' m your husband . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ that 's kind of why i ' m telling you . \\n▁ i just … '' i wandered over and sat on the box at the end of our bed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m getting lost in this web of lies , david , and i do n't really know who to trust . '' \\n▁ ` ` trust me . '' \\n▁ he offered his hand . \\n▁ i took it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m trying . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , trying is n't good enough . \\n▁ what reason on god 's good earth would you have not to trust the one person in the world who always has your best interests at heart ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because that one person is also willing to do things i do n't necessarily agree with in order to protect me . '' \\n▁ he placed his other hand over mine . \\n▁ ` ` and i will do that whether you trust me with your truths or not . \\n▁ nothing will change that . '' \\n▁ i allowed a small smile . \\n▁ ` ` now , tell me what you know about anandene . '' \\n▁ ` ` arthur told me that she cast a spell using the stone of truth , and it brought a curse on the lands - many people died . \\n▁ lilith had to slay anandene on the stone to end the curse . \\n▁ drake offered his life up , but lilith tricked him , captured him and imprisoned him until anandene was dead . \\n▁ there was nothing he could do to save her . '' \\n▁ david swallowed , lowering his hands to his knees as he walked backward and sat on the box . \\n▁ ` ` he never told me that . '' \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake . '' \\n▁ ` ` he told you things ? '' \\n▁ he nodded , his thoughts lost in some other place . \\n▁ ` ` that 's … that 's really awful . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yep . \\n▁ and , so , that 's why he killed lilith , not because he wanted the throne . '' \\n▁ ` ` that makes so much more sense . '' \\n▁ david nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` there are so many lies layered over the top of lies . \\n▁ i can hardly see the truth under it all . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you think arthur was lying about that story ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ that 's the first time i ' ve heard anything of it , which means it 's probably true . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , then , what do you think about drake wanting our child dead ? '' \\n▁ he swiped a hand down his face , sighing , then slid his butt across the box and flopped back on the bed . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't care about that part of the story , ara . \\n▁ the fact is that he 'll never even get half a chance to contemplate the idea of possibly making a plan to kill our child . \\n▁ i wo n't let that happen . '' \\n▁ i moved over and sat right by his waist , running my finger along the belt - line of his jeans . \\n▁ ` ` and , what are you going to do about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ ` ` kill him with the dagger of xxunk ? '' \\n▁ he sat up on his elbow . \\n▁ ` ` how do you know about that ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not as dumb as i look . '' \\n▁ ` ` arthur told you ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` why would he do that ? '' \\n▁ he said to himself , flopping back on the bed again . \\n▁ ` ` he … '' i divided truths in my head and carefully chose which ones to share . \\n▁ ` ` he wanted to prepare me for the fact that you were going to die . '' \\n▁ his chest stopped lifting , his body becoming immensely still , only his throat moving as he obviously swallowed all the grief he was holding but would never share . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you tell me about the dagger ? '' \\n▁ he sighed and rolled up on his elbow , placing his hand firmly over mine . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't want to break your heart . \\n▁ we fought so hard to be together , and you - '' he squeezed my hand . \\n▁ ` ` you wanted to die after you were tortured . \\n▁ and that was only because you thought i was dead . \\n▁ so , what would happen to you if you had to be here , alone , ruling , doing things you did n't believe you were capable of , if you also had the burden of losing me ? '' \\n▁ my eyes watered . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry i did n't tell you , ara . \\n▁ i am . \\n▁ i wanted to , and that 's why i stayed away . \\n▁ in fact , i laid here - '' he pointed to the pillows . \\n▁ ` ` i came to you one night , laid here for hours telling you everything , and in that one perfect moment , as i stroked your cheek , you smiled , and for the first time ever in my life , i felt like everything would be okay . '' \\n▁ i laid a hand gently to his cheek . \\n▁ ` ` it will . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he pulled away . \\n▁ ` ` it wo n't . \\n▁ it ca n't be , and that single moment i let myself believe it would caused more pain than i ever knew existed , because i was forced to realise then that i 'd never feel like that again . '' \\n▁ ` ` but it does n't have to be that way , david . '' \\n▁ i grabbed his hand and held it tight . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to kill drake . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , i do . \\n▁ he will come for you , ara . \\n▁ he will come for our baby one day , and i ca n't - '' he shook his head , searching for words . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't live with that fear . \\n▁ i need you safe . \\n▁ i need our people safe . '' \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't lose you , '' i said , and it was non - negotiable . \\n▁ he looked at me , seeing my thoughts , seeing my strengths , but none of what i felt seemed to matter to him at all . \\n▁ ` ` you will , ara . \\n▁ there is no choice . \\n▁ it takes the hand of a king to use that dagger , and i am the only king . '' \\n▁ ` ` there are hundreds of people who would take that role and kill drake , david . \\n▁ it does n't have to be you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i am the only rightful king , '' his voice grew louder . \\n▁ ` ` there are ways around it , '' i said sternly . \\n▁ and his body shifted , his shoulders going back as he saw the words in my mind : king by right of heir . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i stood up as he appeared across the room by the fireplace . \\n▁ ` ` just … no . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , i would do anything to - '' ` ` it 's out of the question . '' \\n▁ ` ` but it would save our forever . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ it would destroy it , ara ! '' \\n▁ he spun around to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` do you think i would ever be able to touch you again if you 'd been with another man ? '' \\n▁ i sunk back a bit . \\n▁ ` ` i would n't have to sleep with anyone to do it . '' \\n▁ he frowned at me . \\n▁ ` ` ivf , turkey xxunk … '' i suggested . \\n▁ he turned away . \\n▁ ` ` i could n't live with myself if you had to go through that just to save me . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you 'd be living . \\n▁ and i know , from experience , that you can get past just about anything that happens to you , david . \\n▁ you were burned on the fire - you caught me with my legs around mike . \\n▁ you can get past a damn turkey xxunk . '' \\n▁ he went ultra still and ultra quiet for a second , then turned around again , his whole body shaking with laughter . \\n▁ ` ` what are you laughing at ? '' \\n▁ i asked , trying not to smile . \\n▁ ` ` turkey xxunk . '' \\n▁ and i could n't help it . \\n▁ i laughed too . \\n▁ he wandered over and placed a hand to the back of my neck , pulling me in for a kiss on the brow , my favourite kind of kiss . \\n▁ ` ` my love , it 's a good idea , but i ' m the king . \\n▁ it 's my job to die for our people - for you . \\n▁ i swore that in my oath , and that is what i 'll do . '' \\n▁ i stepped back . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he smiled xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` you have no say . \\n▁ arthur gave me the dagger , ara . \\n▁ i ' m leaving for paris in a month to kill drake , and you can either enjoy this time with me , or you can waste it being mad . '' \\n▁ paris ? \\n▁ which meant arthur had n't given him the real dagger , because i knew , and arthur knew , that drake was in romania . \\n▁ i propped my hands on my hips , a challenging grin marking my lips . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ i 'll take door number two . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , be reasonable . '' \\n▁ ` ` me ? \\n▁ me be reasonable ? \\n▁ you 're talking about going to your death , taking our forever and throwing it away , and i do n't get any say ! '' \\n▁ i leaned forward on each word . \\n▁ ` ` and you just think i should sit back and take it ! '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ i stomped my foot . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't , david . \\n▁ if you go … if you go to kill him , i … i 'll do something stupid while you 're gone . '' \\n▁ he stepped into me . \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged out of his grip . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll sleep with arthur and make him king . '' \\n▁ his jaw dropped . \\n▁ ` ` you would n't dare . '' \\n▁ i held strong ; my shoulders straight , head high . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ he grabbed my arm firmly . \\n▁ ` ` if you touch him - '' he shook his head , his teeth like a cage behind his lips . \\n▁ ` ` if you … i 'll kill him . \\n▁ and god help me , ara , i would n't be able to stop myself . '' \\n▁ he dropped my arm and turned away . \\n▁ ` ` so , if you think for one second that having a child with him will save our forever , you 're wrong . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i ' m not , because it 'd mean you 'd be alive . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i will hate you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i can live with that better than your death . '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed , the stern , scary david resting just behind that green gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i am going to tell you something , young lady , and you are going to listen . '' \\n▁ he grabbed both my arms and moved me to sit on the chair . \\n▁ i plonked down clumsily , keeping my eyes on david 's as he squatted in front of me , composing himself . \\n▁ ` ` you will do as you are told . \\n▁ i am king , and i will kill drake . \\n▁ i will not have you touching or carrying the child of another man . '' \\n▁ his voice shook with anger . \\n▁ ` ` this will not be negotiated , and if you even think about going against me , i will have you locked in a cell until word of drake 's death has been received . \\n▁ do i make myself clear ? '' \\n▁ the little girl inside me shook , nodding her head , but the woman i felt growing deep in my soul every day stood taller , readying her sword . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't ask me to accept your death , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not . '' \\n▁ he stood up . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m telling you to . '' \\n▁ ` ` god ! '' \\n▁ i stood up too , and stomped my foot again . \\n▁ ` ` why do you have to be like this ? \\n▁ i ' m not one of your minions . \\n▁ i ' m not someone you can boss around . \\n▁ i am the goddamn queen , and i ! \\n▁ have power ! \\n▁ over you ! \\n▁ maybe i 'll lock you in a cell , and not let you out until i kill drake . '' \\n▁ he rushed up beside me and grabbed my arm again . \\n▁ ` ` you stubborn , spoiled little brat . '' \\n▁ i tugged away . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd rather be a brat in a world where you 're alive than an obedient wife in a world where you 're dead . '' \\n▁ he walked away and sat down on the coffee table in the sitting room , running both hands through his hair . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't fight with you , my love . \\n▁ i ca n't . \\n▁ i wo n't . \\n▁ i have to kill drake . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i know that means i ' m giving up our forever , but i had hoped to at least leave you with a child before i left . '' \\n▁ ` ` so i could be a single , teenage mom ! '' \\n▁ he sighed . \\n▁ ` ` you always wanted a family , ara . \\n▁ a little harry , and - '' ` ` but it wo n't be a little harry , david . \\n▁ i ca n't even fall pregnant . '' \\n▁ my voice broke . \\n▁ ` ` and xxunk do n't have boys . \\n▁ we have girls . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you do n't want a child because you do n't want a girl . '' \\n▁ ` ` i never said that ! '' \\n▁ i screamed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just saying … i do n't want this . \\n▁ any of this . \\n▁ i wanted a family : a mum and a dad and a baby . \\n▁ not an eternity without you . \\n▁ you 're all i have ever wanted to live for . \\n▁ if you take that way , then i have nothing left ! '' \\n▁ he softened a little . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ okay . \\n▁ i know . \\n▁ but you 're strong - stronger than any of us have ever given you credit for , and you will get through this . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i shook my lowered head . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't . '' \\n▁ he appeared a step away from me , testing the waters . \\n▁ ` ` you will . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're wrong . \\n▁ and , if you 're so hell - bent on dying for us , then - '' i looked up at him , my jaw stiff , sight blinded by tears . \\n▁ ` ` i want a divorce . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ he closed the gap between us quickly , his green eyes wide . \\n▁ ` ` you heard me . '' \\n▁ i shuffled my feet , standing a little taller in the domination of his height . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , david , enough that i am willing to do anything to keep you alive , even if that means i ca n't be with you anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what then ? \\n▁ you 're just gon na go out and f * * k some random stranger ! '' \\n▁ he sunk back on his heels , dropping his arm to his side as a flash image of jason came to the front of his thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` or maybe not a stranger . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't go there , david . \\n▁ i did n't have anyone in mind . \\n▁ i ' m just trying to wake you up and make you see that you ca n't make decisions like this without me . \\n▁ i have a say . '' \\n▁ i pointed to my chest . \\n▁ ` ` you 're my husband and i do n't want you to be dead for forever . \\n▁ do n't you remember ? \\n▁ have you forgotten what you told me about how vampires love eternally ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he said , looking down . \\n▁ ` ` then what makes you think it 's okay to leave me , to just die and not care how it makes me feel ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you think i do n't care ? '' \\n▁ he yelled . \\n▁ ` ` ara , i am the only one who actually does care how you feel . \\n▁ i am the one who came after you when my brother was torturing you . \\n▁ i ' m the one who laid burning in a fire , alive , to save our forever , and it was all for nothing , because as soon as those scars healed , my heart was torn open again by this - '' he presented the air , as if everything we were discussing was laying out in front of us , '' - by this truth that i battled with long before you ever even noticed i was struggling with something . \\n▁ i ' ve had to deal with this . \\n▁ i ' ve had to think long and hard about letting drake live , running for the rest of our lives , or killing him and leaving the one girl i never wanted to hurt alone , forever , to fall into who - knows - whose arms . '' \\n▁ he stepped back , rubbing his hairline , his voice shaking on the brink of tears . \\n▁ ` ` so do n't tell me i do n't care how you feel , ara , because it is all i care about . '' \\n▁ my fingers had wrapped so tight around the key on my necklace that , as i dropped my hands , too much blood came rushing back into it . \\n▁ ` ` there has to be something we can do . '' \\n▁ he reached across and placed his hands on both my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` there is . \\n▁ enjoy the last few months we have - make some memories , maybe make a baby . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you 'll leave before she 's even born ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this is just how it has to be , '' he said coldly , turning away . \\n▁ ` ` discussion closed . '' \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ i called , but he disappeared , slamming the bedroom door behind him . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * i sat on my bed , xxunk drying out my cheeks , and told my dad the best of all my adventures living in paris , including how my husband just confessed he was going to his death for some noble , supernatural cause . \\n▁ there was no negotiation , dad , i wrote . \\n▁ he just did n't care how i felt about it , and there was nothing i could say . \\n▁ he had a point , and i know he 's usually always right . \\n▁ but not this time . \\n▁ he 's doing the wrong thing ! \\n▁ what does he think will happen if he just leaves me here - alone ? \\n▁ i wo n't survive it , dad . \\n▁ i wo n't . \\n▁ i never wanted to live without him , and he wo n't reason with me . \\n▁ what am i supposed to do but go behind his back and put a turkey xxunk where it 's not supposed to go ? \\n▁ i do n't want to , dad . \\n▁ i started crying again . \\n▁ i do n't want to betray him , but he 's left me no choice . \\n▁ i just do n't know how to fix this , how to make it that i wo n't lose him . \\n▁ i sobered a little , holding my breath , resting my finger over the ` send ' button . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ my door opened slowly , a head of blonde hair popping in between the crack . \\n▁ ` ` emily . '' \\n▁ i quickly swiped the tears away and deleted the last paragraph , leaving my email as the chirpy , i ' m - doing - well kind my dad really wanted to hear . \\n▁ ` ` what 's up ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sorry to disturb you . \\n▁ i just … can i come in ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sure . '' \\n▁ i moved over and patted the spot on the bed next to me . \\n▁ but emily closed my door and walked over , taking a seat on the foot of my bed instead , her knees facing the dresser as if maybe she had bad news and did n't want to see my face as she said it . \\n▁ ` ` what 's up , em ? '' \\n▁ ` ` blade just told me , '' she said , as quiet as a mouse . \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ she drew a jagged breath , wiping her wrist along her nose . \\n▁ ` ` david went to mike - told him about this dagger . '' \\n▁ my blood ran cold . \\n▁ ` ` and … what did mike say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he … '' she scraped repeatedly at the back of her hand with her thumbnail . \\n▁ ` ` he threw things , yelled , screamed . \\n▁ they fought , but he … '' ` ` he what , em ? '' \\n▁ i edged forward . \\n▁ she placed both hands slowly on the bed beside her legs . \\n▁ ` ` he promised david he 'd take care of you - make sure you did n't do anything to stop him . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ! '' \\n▁ i sat up and shoved my laptop aside . \\n▁ ` ` why would he do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david 's kind of right , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` how ? \\n▁ how is he possibly right to go to his death ! '' \\n▁ emily braved a sideways glance at me , her shoulders wrapping her ears . \\n▁ ` ` who else can ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it does n't have to be this way . \\n▁ we do n't have to kill drake . \\n▁ we can reason with him , or … i do n't know , anything . \\n▁ but not death . \\n▁ that 's eternal , emily . \\n▁ do n't you care ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course i care . '' \\n▁ she spun around on the spot to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` you know i love david . \\n▁ but i love you , too , ara , and i care about the future of our people , and that means we need you alive because we need an heir to the throne - david 's blood or not . '' \\n▁ i hid my face slowly in my hands . \\n▁ ` ` why ca n't anyone , ever , just take my side ? '' \\n▁ she appeared beside me , sweeping my head against her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m on your side . \\n▁ but , i. . . \\n▁ i just do n't know how to talk sense to him , ara . \\n▁ all i can do is accept what he thinks is best and just go along with it . '' \\n▁ i uncovered my face . \\n▁ ` ` you 're afraid of him . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not afraid of him . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i smirked . '' \\n▁ 'cause you … you 're kinda pale . '' \\n▁ she adjusted her seat . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i ' m just … cautious not to aggravate him . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` precisely . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not , ara . \\n▁ not really . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ we both sat smiling for a few seconds , but inside , a part of me was battling with the other half that thought telling emily my plan to have a child with arthur was a bad idea . \\n▁ ` ` what if there was a way i could save him ? '' \\n▁ i said , still talking myself into involving her . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what if - '' i sat up more . \\n▁ ` ` what if there was a way i could crown someone else king ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so david would n't be the one who had to kill drake ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i 'd say do it . \\n▁ yeah . \\n▁ whatever it takes , ara . '' \\n▁ she nodded , becoming more convinced by the second . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m on your side . \\n▁ if there 's a way we can save him , let 's do it . '' \\n▁ ` ` it would mean … '' i hesitated . \\n▁ ` ` it could hurt him , though . '' \\n▁ her eyes went dark , her chin slowly rolling upward , making her shoulders straight and her spine tall . \\n▁ ` ` you mean xxunk xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she brushed her skirt down her legs as she shot to her feet and took a few steps backward . \\n▁ ` ` no way . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if you have even half a brain in that head , ara , you wo n't do anything of the sort . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not getting in the middle of that . \\n▁ if that 's your only plan - '' she walked over and opened my door . \\n▁ ` ` you 're on your own . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine , '' i said to myself as she slammed it behind her . \\n▁ every summer , as a little girl , i 'd leave the wintry cool of my home in australia and fly a couple of thousand miles across the sea to my dad 's house . \\n▁ i only ever stayed a few weeks at a time , but it meant everything to him . \\n▁ i knew that as deep as i knew my own soul . \\n▁ every night , when he 'd tuck me in and kiss my head , he 'd take a minute or two to sit by my bed and tell me a story - always some tale about love conquering all - before winding the mechanism on the base of my music box , setting it down on my grandmother 's dresser , and closing my bedroom door . \\n▁ i 'd fall asleep to the gentle hum of his voice lingering in my ears and the soothing chimes of a lullaby . \\n▁ now , whenever i hear rusty clicks moving a string of notes toward the end of a song , it always takes me back to the sweetness and innocence of childhood . \\n▁ but , this tune was different . \\n▁ i lay staring at the dome of stained glass above my bed , imagining that little girl in the picture had grown up and lived some amazing life . \\n▁ but the score to my imagined story , chiming through the night from the silver box david gave me the night before our wedding , conflicted the joyous past i tried to create with a quite sombre , rather daunting one - bringing more sorrow and mystery than i think the composer intended . \\n▁ the notes rolled off each other in ghostly succession , the melody so intrinsic it took on what felt like solid form , floating in the summer air above me - a foggy white light , littered with tiny sparkles . \\n▁ no one ever taught me the words - given that they were in the ancient language , but somehow , i 'd sung the translated version the day david died at elysium . \\n▁ lying here now , though , i could n't recall even one lyric - didn ' t even know the title . \\n▁ ` ` mort de xxunk , '' a small voice whispered . \\n▁ ` ` death of love . '' \\n▁ my eyes moved from the glass dome above to the child beside me . \\n▁ her golden hair fell in long , crinkled waves over her shoulders , framing the eternally youthful face of pale skin , unblemished by life . \\n▁ she sat toying with the golden apple , spinning it carelessly between her fingertips . \\n▁ ` ` mort de xxunk , '' i said it quietly to myself , sitting up a little . \\n▁ ` ` do you know the words ? '' \\n▁ she nodded , her small mouth opening , waiting for the gears to spin back around to the song 's beginning . \\n▁ and her voice was high like a child from the choir of angels - the words of the song touching my ears for the first time , despite once having moved my lips . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and listened for the meaning - catching a moment of sorrow within it that was quickly retrieved by the deep undertone of love . \\n▁ eternal love . \\n▁ the words faded away then to nothing but a soft breath , a few seconds after the xxunk . \\n▁ eve looked down as if the golden apple had been mentioned in the lyric , and held it up , giving it a gentle turn to show a small hole in the side . \\n▁ ` ` what is that ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a keyhole . '' \\n▁ ` ` a keyhole ? '' \\n▁ i reached for the apple ; she drew it away . \\n▁ ` ` what 's inside ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the secrets . '' \\n▁ ` ` can you share them with me ? '' \\n▁ her gaze went to my collarbones . \\n▁ ` ` only you hold the key . '' \\n▁ i touched my necklace . \\n▁ ` ` this key ? '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps , '' she said , slowly reaching across to cup my hand with her tiny , cool fingers , then turned my palm upward , laying the apple there . \\n▁ ` ` but the hole is too big for this key . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you 're not looking at it properly , '' she said , and a coy smile moved her lip , her hand coming up a second later to swipe the apple . \\n▁ it rolled , bouncing off my fingers in a series of failed attempts to catch it , hitting the ground with a thud , then disappearing under the bed . \\n▁ ` ` eve ? '' \\n▁ i looked back at her , but the only thing beside me now was the peacefully sleeping man sprawled out like a starfish , taking up way more than his fair share of the bed . \\n▁ i waited a moment to see if the thud woke him , holding my breath as i watched his chest move rhythmically up and down , the cool air coming from his nose , moving across the sheets and brushing my pinkie where my hand rested , propping my arm up against the sheets . \\n▁ satisfied he was n't planning to wake up and accuse me of conspiring with imagined figures , i rolled onto my belly , hooked one hand to the underside of the bed , and hoisted myself over the edge toward the ground - lifting the bed skirt to search beneath the mattress . \\n▁ the blood rushed into my skull in this half upside - down position , making my eyes want to pop . \\n▁ but i had to find that apple . \\n▁ the only gold things under the bed , though , were the intricately - weaved letters on the spine of the book xxunk showed me last month : aide - xxunk de xxunk . \\n▁ xxunk ? \\n▁ i sat up again , frowning . \\n▁ i 'd heard that word somewhere before . \\n▁ but could n't place my finger on it . \\n▁ not that it mattered right now anyway . \\n▁ the apple was gone , as if it had never been in my hand in the first place . \\n▁ yet , i could still feel the chill of eve 's skin . \\n▁ maybe it was a dream . \\n▁ maybe not . \\n▁ but one thing was for sure : that apple held some kind of key to some kind of secret eve wanted me to know . \\n▁ i 'd looked at it many times - spun it around in my fingertips , just as eve had , but i 'd never seen a keyhole there before . \\n▁ what did it all mean ? \\n▁ i threw the covers back , my nightdress unravelling in layers of silk around my feet as i wandered over to the fireplace , briefly glancing back to see if i woke david . \\n▁ he did n't wake , not even when the door to the secret passage squeaked fiercely , as if it 'd not been opened in a hundred years . \\n▁ cobwebs broke across my nose and throat as i walked the dark steps downward , placing my toes gently to each one in case it caved under my weight . \\n▁ normally , in these situations , i 'd tell myself not to be scared , that silly things like ghosts and vampires did n't exist but , for some reason , i just could n't take my word for it . \\n▁ i reached the base and stood for a moment in the dusty darkness , considering turning back and at least getting a lantern . \\n▁ there was no light in that room , and the dawn was still a good hour or so away . \\n▁ but , if i went back upstairs and david caught me sneaking around , i 'd have to either justify my mission or come up with some lie . \\n▁ and there had been enough lies between us lately . \\n▁ enough that neither of my two options was all that appealing . \\n▁ so , i pushed the door open , cringing as the groaning hinges screeched their protest in an echo through the tunnel for all who may be waking in the manor to hear . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ my quick steps halted immediately , and the figure sitting on the edge of eve 's bed resolved itself into a man , his elbows on his knees , holding something rag - like in his hands . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` hey , ara . '' \\n▁ he looked up from the floor between his feet , offering a weak smile . \\n▁ ` ` hey , what are you doing in here ? '' \\n▁ i walked over , letting the dense relief swim through my limbs and relax them . \\n▁ ` ` i like to come here to think . '' \\n▁ ` ` why here ? '' \\n▁ i motioned around the dusty space - its ancient fabrics and trinkets making it look like a haunted house . \\n▁ ` ` it 's so eerie . '' \\n▁ ` ` same reason you came down here , i guess . '' \\n▁ i frowned at him . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a secret . \\n▁ no one in the world can find you here unless they know about this room . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you wanted total privacy ? '' \\n▁ he slowly cast his gaze to the floor again . \\n▁ ` ` something like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , i guess that means you heard about david 's little suicide mission ? '' \\n▁ i swung around the bedpost and came to rest on the mattress beside jase , stirring up a dust cloud as i landed . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you think ? \\n▁ i mean - '' i cleared my throat . \\n▁ ` ` how do you feel about it ? '' \\n▁ he stood , dumping the thing he was holding on the chair as he passed it . \\n▁ ` ` like cutting a hole in my gut to drain out all the guilt , all the pain , all the fear . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ i stood too . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ he nodded to himself . \\n▁ ` ` growing up , we … we 'd fight . \\n▁ we 'd play pranks on each other and , sometimes , we 'd do things brothers really should n't do - nasty things . \\n▁ but i always loved him , ara . \\n▁ i ' ve always known he 'd be there after to make up with or punch in the arm every day for a year until we got over whatever little feud it was we had at the time . \\n▁ and i was okay with that - it was how we were . \\n▁ but … '' he sat down in the chair on top of what he 'd just thrown there . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't even imagine him not being here . \\n▁ i ca n't comprehend the idea that my brother will be gone … for forever . '' \\n▁ i wandered over and squatted before him , resting my hand gently over his . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't let this happen , jase . \\n▁ i swear . \\n▁ i will find some way to stop him . '' \\n▁ ` ` how , ara ? '' \\n▁ he stood , brushing past me . \\n▁ ` ` you know what he 's like . \\n▁ i saw the argument you had . '' \\n▁ ` ` you saw that ? '' \\n▁ i spun on the balls of my toes to watch him . \\n▁ he tapped his temple . \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i got to my feet slowly . \\n▁ ` ` it 's over , '' he said , defeated . \\n▁ ` ` i tried . \\n▁ i ' ve tried so many things to - '' he stopped on a break in his voice . \\n▁ ` ` but nothing worked . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ he 's going to die . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't accept that , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's too bad , '' he said kindly . \\n▁ ` ` he wo n't wait for you to accept it , ara . \\n▁ it is what it is . '' \\n▁ ` ` why wo n't he help me help him ? '' \\n▁ i said , breaking to tears on the last word . \\n▁ ` ` i thought by coming to him , by getting it all out in the open , maybe we could change things , maybe we could work together - do something . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ and it was the right thing to do , but … '' ` ` but , it did n't work . \\n▁ he does n't care . \\n▁ it 's like he wants to die . '' \\n▁ ` ` or maybe he 's just already accepted it . '' \\n▁ ` ` hmpf . \\n▁ easy for some , '' i muttered , wiping my nose . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ it 's not . \\n▁ do n't you see , ara ? \\n▁ it 's not that he does n't care or that he wants to die , but that it 's taken him so long to accept his fate that he 's worried it 's all gon na come undone with one word of hope , and then he 's going to lose all that again when whatever plan you had fails . '' \\n▁ i swiped a tear from the very tip of my nose . \\n▁ ` ` i get that . \\n▁ i do . \\n▁ i really understand what he 's gone through to cope with what he has to do , but i do n't care . \\n▁ i just … '' ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` you know what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know what will happen to you when he 's gone ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ask yourself this , '' jase said , stopping in front of me . \\n▁ ` ` what does it mean to you ? \\n▁ what will your life be when he 's no longer in it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ empty , '' i answered quickly . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ think harder . \\n▁ think about that first day , when you wake up and there 's a shift in the paradigm . \\n▁ when you look out the window and suddenly that sense that he 's out there , that you 'll see him next week or that you 'll argue with him about something he said , will be gone . \\n▁ like staring at a blank canvas . '' \\n▁ he rolled his shoulders back slowly , watching the realisation form in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` there 'll never be any way to paint over that . \\n▁ there will never be any way to fill that hole , ara , and i love you , you know that , but even i ca n't fill that hole for you . \\n▁ i know … '' he sighed , dropping his hands to his knees for a second before standing tall again . \\n▁ ` ` i know you ' ve messed up from time to time when it comes to him and the way you love him . \\n▁ but you do love him , and that 's what counts in the end , ara , because after a hundred years with one person , that 's the only thing that keeps you together . \\n▁ god knows . '' \\n▁ he rubbed his brow . \\n▁ ` ` i tried . \\n▁ i … but we failed , and it breaks my heart so immensely deep that you 'll have to suffer that - that you 'll have to feel that way for even a second . \\n▁ i would do anything … '' his fists tightened . \\n▁ ` ` anything to keep you from that , because your life wo n't just be empty without him , ara , it 'll be like living without air . '' \\n▁ i stepped closer , my eyes wide . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he know this , too , ara . \\n▁ he knows all that his death will do to you , and he is still going to go - still going to let you suffer that , because his reasons for dying far outweigh anything else he might care about . '' \\n▁ ` ` what reasons ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's just it . '' \\n▁ he offered a gentle smile ; just one corner of his lip turning up , gifting me with the presence of his dimple . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't even know . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ i spun around quickly . \\n▁ ` ` david . '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing in here ? '' \\n▁ he glared at jason as he walked over and placed his arm around me possessively . \\n▁ ` ` i was already in here when she came in , '' jase said flatly . \\n▁ ` ` fine . '' \\n▁ david looked from him to me , then back again . \\n▁ ` ` then tell me what 's going on . '' \\n▁ ` ` we were just discussing your recent decision , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ he sighed , stepping away . \\n▁ ` ` get back to bed . \\n▁ we 're not having this discussion again . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't do that to her . '' \\n▁ jason moved in , coming up fast in front of david . \\n▁ ` ` she has the right to fight for you . \\n▁ there has to be another way . '' \\n▁ david just smiled . \\n▁ ` ` would i be going to my death if there were ? '' \\n▁ ` ` look , i understand that , but - '' jase 's words stopped , his eyes going smaller . \\n▁ ` ` where did you get that information ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what information ? '' \\n▁ i asked , stepping into the conversation . \\n▁ david glanced back at me once , his shoulders sinking . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you get it , brother ? \\n▁ this has to end with her . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ i curled my white fingertips over his forearm . \\n▁ ` ` please do n't leave me in the dark anymore , david . \\n▁ i ' m begging you . '' \\n▁ he looked at jason one more time , who nodded , almost as if agreeing with something , then softly spoke my name - all the fight , the strain , the depth leaving his voice in defeat . \\n▁ ` ` what you know of the prophecy so far is wrong . '' \\n▁ ` ` what … what parts ? '' \\n▁ ` ` all of it . \\n▁ it 's backward , misinterpreted . '' \\n▁ he started pacing . \\n▁ ` ` this child , this blood of knight and lilithian , that 's not you . \\n▁ nothing has been foretold . \\n▁ only promised . '' \\n▁ ` ` promised ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what those pages are is - '' david stopped and looked away . \\n▁ ` ` they 're not a prophecy , ara . \\n▁ they 're a contract . '' \\n▁ my eyes darted to jason . \\n▁ ` ` so jason was right . '' \\n▁ david frowned at him . \\n▁ ` ` you told her it was a contract ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i did . '' \\n▁ ` ` how did you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` arthur did n't tell me , '' jason said , answering an unspoken question . \\n▁ ` ` i only had to read it to see the truth . '' \\n▁ ` ` and still , '' david said , turning away to rub his head . \\n▁ ` ` it seems even you missed the proverbial left hand while you were watching the right . '' \\n▁ ` ` so it would seem . '' \\n▁ jason nodded once then looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` ara , you ' ve not only been mislead , pretty girl . \\n▁ you ' ve been lied to . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? \\n▁ by who ? '' \\n▁ i asked jase , but it really was aimed more at david , because i already knew the answer - could feel the tension coming off david 's soul in waves . \\n▁ ` ` me , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` and morgaine , '' jason added . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i nearly rocketed forward to grab david and shake him . \\n▁ ` ` we deliberately mislead you , my love - misled everyone . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it began as bended truth , many centuries ago , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` morgaine needed others to back her against a king she wanted overthrown . \\n▁ but without hope of new queen rising , the xxunk would n't stand . \\n▁ so , she tore the scrolls , burnt them , marred them in order to make the words appear as if they were from the book of carmen - '' ` ` what 's the book of carmen ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` a collection of xxunk 's predictions written down throughout the centuries , '' jase informed . \\n▁ ` ` morgaine made people believe there was a prophecy , '' david continued . \\n▁ ` ` and she created an army in the name of the new queen , not knowing whether one would ever return . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would she go to such lengths ? \\n▁ what the hell is it we 're fighting against ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake , '' both boys said simply . \\n▁ ` ` he is a master of the dark arts , ara . \\n▁ he deals with black magic , and as if that were n't something to fear enough , those dealings with the devil have turned his soul into something as twisted and black as death itself , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` he has done unspeakable things , and even in a society of killers , there is a line we all draw . \\n▁ morgaine was tired of seeing her people - your people suffer . \\n▁ she had to stop him , even if it took her centuries to do it . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , she made the contract look like a prophecy ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` would n't they have supported her if it was a contract ? \\n▁ i mean , does n't it promise the restoration of things taken ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ it promises to restore one thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` what one thing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we do n't actually know . '' \\n▁ david sighed the words out . \\n▁ ` ` no one does . \\n▁ it was never mentioned in the contract . '' \\n▁ ` ` all we do know for sure , ara , '' jason said , ` ` is that there 's no document foretelling the birth of a child - or the future possibility to restore mortality to vampires . '' \\n▁ i let that sink in for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , ara , '' david said softly . \\n▁ ` ` we ca n't free the immortal damned . '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' i cupped my hand over his as it landed on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay , david . \\n▁ jase already told me that might be the case . '' \\n▁ david glared at jason . \\n▁ ` ` you knew this as well ? '' \\n▁ jason nodded . \\n▁ ` ` arthur told me what happened that day . '' \\n▁ ` ` what day ? '' \\n▁ i studied both boys , completely confused . \\n▁ david stepped back , closing his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` we never intended to make up that part of the prophecy , ara . \\n▁ morgaine told our people of a coming queen - one who would bear a child that could kill drake . \\n▁ but , when you were rescued from elysium , we … '' ` ` they all thought you just wanted to die , '' jason finished for him , looking back at me . \\n▁ ` ` we did n't realise it was merely because you believed i was dead . \\n▁ and in a moment of desperation , morgaine told you that lie - told you there was a way to save the damned . '' \\n▁ david hung his head in shame . \\n▁ ` ` and neither herself , nor i , have had the courage to correct it since that day . '' \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ i whispered his name , my heart breaking a little , not for the truth , though , but for the fact that he not only went to so much trouble to lie to me , but keep it up too . \\n▁ i felt stupid and used . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` this … '' i said through my teeth . \\n▁ ` ` this is why you would n't approve jason 's lab ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he eyed jason suspiciously . \\n▁ ` ` and now i ' m left wondering why my brother , who also clearly knew more than he let on , was xxunk for a lab to research ways to do something he knows ca n't be done . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was n't just for the immortality cure , david . \\n▁ you know that , '' jase said sharply . \\n▁ ` ` i clearly outlined my concerns for her safety and the - '' ` ` mike has it under control , '' david yelled . \\n▁ ` ` has what under control ? '' \\n▁ i stepped between the two of them . \\n▁ david composed himself . \\n▁ ` ` your blue light . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my hands . \\n▁ ` ` that is not control , '' jason said , presenting me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve warned you , david . \\n▁ he could be hurting her by pushing her . \\n▁ and she 's tired of being in pain , brother - '' ` ` she is my problem , jason . \\n▁ not yours . \\n▁ you - '' ` ` it 's not just her pain , though . \\n▁ i told you . \\n▁ i showed you all the facts , david . \\n▁ i strongly believe that , beneath all these lies , we may have actually found a way to restore mortal life . '' \\n▁ david let a breath out through his nose like an angry bull . \\n▁ ` ` brother , there is no - '' ` ` so what does the contract mean ? '' \\n▁ i cut in before they started bickering again . \\n▁ ` ` what does it actually agree on ? '' \\n▁ david 's shoulders rolled back to their correct position . \\n▁ ` ` like you said , ara . \\n▁ it was a simple promise drake made to lilith to give something back in exchange for a child . '' \\n▁ ` ` not just a child , '' jason said , his throat tight , his teeth closed . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' david added , his fists falling loose . \\n▁ ` ` her child , one not yet born , but sworn to be conceived under certain conditions . '' \\n▁ ` ` certain conditions ? '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` tell her , or i will . '' \\n▁ jason stared david down - both of them meeting eye to eye , like a man staring into a mirror . \\n▁ ` ` fine , '' he added , peeling his eyes away from his brother . \\n▁ ` ` ara , your blood is cursed . '' \\n▁ ` ` cursed ? '' \\n▁ i repeated , feeling like i had the repeat - every - last - line - these - guys - say disease . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` to bear only females until the debt is repaid - a debt lilith bequeathed your bloodline - passed down from mother to daughter over the centuries , until falling , finally , on you . '' \\n▁ ` ` which further xxunk our conclusions that your mom eleanor was n't your biological mother , ara , '' david added . \\n▁ ` ` since she gave birth to a boy . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , so my dad is n't my dad . \\n▁ my mom was n't my mom . \\n▁ and i can only have girls until i ' ve given drake my firstborn . '' \\n▁ david shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ until your firstborn is conceived with a nobleman 's son . '' \\n▁ ` ` a nobleman ? '' \\n▁ i grimaced . \\n▁ ` ` what , like a - '' ` ` knight . '' \\n▁ jase winked at me . \\n▁ ` ` as in … '' i pictured a man riding a horse in a metal suit with a jousting stick . \\n▁ ` ` like a. . . '' \\n▁ ` ` men were not knighted only for their ability to wield a sword , ara , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` they were knighted for the nobility they either had in their blood or in their hearts . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , i have to a baby with someone who 's noble . '' \\n▁ ` ` not just any noble , '' jason said , casting his gaze slowly across the dusty room to his brother . \\n▁ ` ` one specific noble . '' \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ david sniffed once , standing taller . \\n▁ ` ` me . '' \\n▁ i went to speak , tell him i already knew that , but jase cut in . \\n▁ ` ` you were n't meant to exist , ara , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` lilith was supposed to be the one who bore a child with david . '' \\n▁ ` ` whoa . '' \\n▁ i suddenly needed to sit down , but stayed standing , unable to move . \\n▁ lilith … and david ? \\n▁ no way . \\n▁ no freakin ' way . \\n▁ ` ` then … i was n't foretold or promised ? \\n▁ you were , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` more like designed , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean by that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake needed blood of the purest forms to create this child . \\n▁ now , we do n't know why that was a requirement , '' david reported , as if he were a lawyer in a court , presenting facts to a jury . \\n▁ ` ` but he cast a spell on my father 's bloodline many centuries ago - one that would see only sons born to the blood of knight until , at last , the cleansing was complete and two sons would be born to one mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` one with the purest of heart , '' jason said and looked at david . \\n▁ ` ` and the other … '' ` ` centuries of all the bad in one little boy . '' \\n▁ those words swallowed my thoughts for a minute , reminding me of what david 's own father believed about jason . \\n▁ ` ` jason 's the impure one ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so it would seem . '' \\n▁ jason looked at his feet . \\n▁ ` ` and you 're - '' i walked over and touched his shoulder , ignoring david 's quick intake of breath . \\n▁ ` ` you 're learning this for the first time ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was always told as such . \\n▁ i just never knew it would turn out to be true . '' \\n▁ ` ` how did your father know ? '' \\n▁ i looked at david . \\n▁ ` ` we 're not sure . \\n▁ but he misinterpreted the meaning , taking it to mean jason would be evil . '' \\n▁ i smiled across at jason . \\n▁ he was far from evil . \\n▁ ` ` so , you were originally intended to be with lilith then , david ? '' \\n▁ he nodded once . \\n▁ ` ` we 're not sure what went wrong . \\n▁ all we do know is that you carry her blood and her curse . \\n▁ you could bear child after child , ara , but the curse will not break until this child is born of yours and my blood . '' \\n▁ and , finally , the information in the scrolls made sense . \\n▁ for once . \\n▁ ` ` how do you know this stuff ? '' \\n▁ david 's dimple showed for a second . \\n▁ ` ` what do you think i ' ve been doing all these months ? '' \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ i nodded , rubbing my face . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ info overload . '' \\n▁ jason laughed once , and the sound brought me back a little , made me realise we were all still here , not lost somewhere in the past . \\n▁ ` ` so he wants our baby , '' i said simply . \\n▁ ` ` let 's just not have one . '' \\n▁ ` ` we ca n't do that , either . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because of the curse . '' \\n▁ ` ` the blood curse ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ if we do not conceive before i die , and you were to go on to love another - '' david cleared his throat , his eyes clearly avoiding jason . \\n▁ ` ` any child you bear with that man will carry the burden that is yours , that was your mothers before you and so on and so on - the curse repeating itself over and over , passed down to the firstborn , until this child , conceived of my blood , exists . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , the curse will break on conception ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , that 's what drake agreed to restore or … give back ? '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps , but it 's not relevant or even important , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` then what is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` killing drake . '' \\n▁ he stepped closer . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you see ? \\n▁ we ca n't run from this . \\n▁ i must father our child to save her sitting where you sit now , carrying a curse that is not hers . \\n▁ and from the second she is a living being inside your body , her life will be in danger . '' \\n▁ ` ` why in danger ? \\n▁ you said you do n't know what drake plans to do with her . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 's been promised to him , that 's all we need to know , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve lived a hundred years under his roof , ara , and he is not - '' david held his finger up , angling his head away , '' - getting my daughter . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , then … he needs to die ? '' \\n▁ i said , though i could n't feel the words come from my lips . \\n▁ ` ` yes , because if i choose to live - to run and not kill drake , then we will look over our shoulders every day , my love , wondering if today is the day our baby girl does n't come home from school , if today is the day he finds her . '' \\n▁ david walked over and cupped both my shoulders gently , leaning down to look right into my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i was born purely to end this curse , ara . \\n▁ there is no way around this . '' \\n▁ i wanted to scream and yell - wanted to find the corpse of lilith and burn it or stab it repeatedly for undoing everything i ever thought i had . \\n▁ david was never mine . \\n▁ he probably only fell in love with me because he and lilith were meant for each other . \\n▁ ` ` how long have you known about this ? '' \\n▁ i said so quietly that jase took a step forward , his hand twitching as if he planned to touch me . \\n▁ david took a second , but finally answered with , ` ` since before you left for xxunk . '' \\n▁ i sat down on the armchair , landing on the doll jase had thrown there earlier . \\n▁ neither of the boys said a word for a while . \\n▁ jase watched me carefully , probably reading my thoughts , while david stood staring at the ground . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't care about this blood curse , david . \\n▁ not when there is still a way to save you , '' i said softly , not really wanting a challenge , but not ready to give up the fight either . \\n▁ ` ` having a child with another man and sending him to kill drake is not the answer , either , ara , '' david said calmly , even though it was through his teeth . \\n▁ ` ` i checked . \\n▁ i talked with walt , with arthur , and they have varying opinions , but one fact remains : the scrolls that describe our laws clearly state that the child must be born for a xxunk xxunk to take his throne . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ both jase and i said . \\n▁ i stood up . \\n▁ ` ` i thought it could be as long as i was pregnant . '' \\n▁ ` ` when it comes to the law , ara , ask me . \\n▁ trust me . \\n▁ i ' m the one who knows every in and out and every loophole . \\n▁ the child must be born , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` and before our new king even had a chance to kill drake , he would swoop in , steal you and your unborn child , and probably kill it in the womb to stop the cycle repeating . \\n▁ i ca n't let that happen . '' \\n▁ i sat down again . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you just tell me all this when we argued earlier ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' he looked at his brother . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ ` ` say it , '' jase said , but his voice broke beneath a breathy laugh . \\n▁ ` ` what , you think she 's gon na laugh at you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ david studied his feet . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i just forget sometimes that you can be reasoned with , ara . \\n▁ that you - '' he stopped and came to kneel in front of me , gently taking my fingertips in his . \\n▁ ` ` that you 're my best friend , and i can tell you anything . '' \\n▁ i smiled at him . \\n▁ ` ` you reminded me of that by coming to me earlier , being straight with me , and i really appreciated that . \\n▁ i know i came across as angry and unreasonable , but it 's … if there was anything else we could do , i would already be doing it . \\n▁ do you really think i want to leave you ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` well , i do n't , silly girl . \\n▁ i have everything i ever wanted and so many things i would never have imagined to want . \\n▁ but i have to give up this life - '' he reached up and cupped my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` have to leave you alone , because this burden was born to me , not to you , my love . \\n▁ i do n't want to be looking over my shoulder for the rest of forever , and i do n't want that for you . '' \\n▁ i nodded , laying my hand over his . \\n▁ ` ` please , ara . \\n▁ just tell me you understand . \\n▁ i need you to understand . '' \\n▁ i nodded again . \\n▁ i understood perfectly , which was exactly why i could n't bring myself to say it . \\n▁ ` ` when … when do you plan to go ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that depends . '' \\n▁ ` ` on what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you . '' \\n▁ ` ` why me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if you … '' his pupils grew wider looking into mine . \\n▁ ` ` knowing this now , do you still want to have a child with me ? '' \\n▁ i tried not to grin like a little girl , but i could n't help it . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ more than ever . '' \\n▁ ` ` then i 'll leave for romania in a month , after we ' ve conceived . '' \\n▁ he kissed my nose and stood up . \\n▁ ` ` romania ? '' \\n▁ i gasped . \\n▁ ` ` how did you - i mean , i thought he was in paris , '' i corrected , playing dumb , trying not to think about the conversation arthur and i had a few weeks ago , when he confessed to forging a letter reporting drake 's whereabouts . \\n▁ ` ` it was a lie , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` my spies have located him in romania . '' \\n▁ i sat silently , cursing david and his competence . \\n▁ ` ` jason ? '' \\n▁ he turned to his brother , whose obvious distress had not gone unnoticed . \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' jason paused , his face going almost blue with horror . \\n▁ he took a few slow steps backward , his butt meeting the shelf , making it wobble unsteadily on the uneven wood floors . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve made a really big mistake . '' \\n▁ ` ` what mistake ? '' \\n▁ david appeared in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` speak to me , brother ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i have to … '' jason looked at me once before slowly turning his gaze back to david . \\n▁ ` ` there 's something you need to know . '' \\n▁ david cupped his hand along the side of jason 's neck , his thumb on his face like some mafia boss . \\n▁ ` ` you can tell me anything , brother , you know that . '' \\n▁ ` ` i just wanted to save you - to save her from what she 'd do to save you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? \\n▁ hold that thought . '' \\n▁ david halted the conversation with his index finger and grabbed his phone from his back pocket . \\n▁ ` ` yo . '' \\n▁ i frowned at jason , but he averted his eyes quickly . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ i 'll be there in a sec . '' \\n▁ david hung up and stowed the phone again , untucking his shirttail where the device dragged it into his pocket a little . \\n▁ ` ` ara , time for bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mike 's got an issue with one of the damned . \\n▁ i got ta run . '' \\n▁ ` ` so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so , i ' m not leaving you two in the same room - alone . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes at him . \\n▁ ` ` grow up , david . \\n▁ what d'you think i ' m gon na do ? \\n▁ make a baby with him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not funny , ara . '' \\n▁ i shrugged , trying not to laugh at the look on his face . \\n▁ he pointed at jason . \\n▁ ` ` it 's on your shoulders , brother . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not gon na touch her . '' \\n▁ ` ` see that you do n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ i stood , but he disappeared . \\n▁ ` ` argh ! \\n▁ he has got to stop doing that . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? \\n▁ i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ a frown moved in across my face , my gaze slowly landing on jason . \\n▁ ` ` why are you sorry ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ he exhaled , folding over as if he was puffed out . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know that - about the law . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i … if i 'd known . \\n▁ i would never have … '' ` ` jase , you 're scaring me . '' \\n▁ i took a few steps closer and bent down to his level , gently tilting his chin upward . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ he opened his mouth , his eyes darting over every inch of my face , but no words came . \\n▁ ` ` jase , please . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve failed you so many times , in so many ways , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you talking about ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i just … i just need you to know that i ' m sorry - for everything . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i half laughed , stroking his stubbly cheek over and over again . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , jase . \\n▁ really . \\n▁ everything 's okay . '' \\n▁ he sobered with a shaky breath . \\n▁ ` ` it is . \\n▁ as long as he never asks me what i was about to say . '' \\n▁ my frown deepened . \\n▁ ` ` what were you about to say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` something that would ' ve ruined your last few months together . '' \\n▁ he stood straight again . \\n▁ ` ` it was stupid . \\n▁ i was n't thinking . '' \\n▁ ` ` what would ruin it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ just … nothing . '' \\n▁ ` ` have you … ? \\n▁ did you … ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's nothing , ara . '' \\n▁ he reached across and rubbed my arm reassuringly . \\n▁ ` ` i - it was just bringing up the past . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , do n't do that . '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ ` ` he hates even thinking about it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i 'll uh … '' he backed away a few steps . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll see ya later , sweet girl , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` o - '' i started , but when i looked up to see his smiling eyes , he was gone . \\n▁ ` ` what is it with these knight boys and farewells ? '' \\n▁ i said , imagining eve down here in the eerie old room beside me . \\n▁ but no one answered . \\n▁ the morning had risen outside as we 'd all talked , and there was at least enough light in here now to find a small golden apple if one were searching for it . \\n▁ so , i put my aches and problems away inside my chest for a minute and dusted my hands off on my nightdress , even though they were n't dirty , then folded myself in half to look under the bed . \\n▁ that apple i dreamed about was in here somewhere . \\n▁ i could have sworn i 'd put it on the dresser last time , but it was n't there when i stole a glance behind jason just now . \\n▁ ` ` eve ? '' \\n▁ i said softly , not sure if she was here or if she was even real . \\n▁ ` ` can you help me find it ? '' \\n▁ a high chime rang through the air then , sharp , but melodious , drowned out slightly by the clicking of gears . \\n▁ i walked slowly over to the music box on the dresser and , there , sitting among a few small trinkets , was the golden apple eve was given before she died . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , eve , '' i whispered , picking it up . \\n▁ ` ` i promise you i 'll figure this out . '' \\n▁ the apple glimmered in what little dawn light crept in between the boarded windows . \\n▁ it was heavy for something so small , reminding me a little of a fairy tale i read when i was young - about a golden ball and a frog . \\n▁ i turned it several times in my hands , poking the smooth , cold surface , but there was no hole , no button , no secret door . \\n▁ it was completely solid . \\n▁ and i had no idea what that meant . \\n▁ maybe the keyhole i saw in my dream was a mistake or maybe even a metaphor , as in , maybe , the apple was the key to something , or the door to something . \\n▁ ` ` okay , you know that promise i just made ? '' \\n▁ i said suggestively , then curled my fingers around the golden apple , hiding it away as i headed for the stairs again . \\n▁ when the secret door closed behind me this morning as the dawn settled toward day , i 'd stood in my empty room for longer than the clock ticking on the wall cared to admit . \\n▁ but david did n't come back up - didn ' t come to talk to me or make everything okay . \\n▁ he was gone , clearly off somewhere playing his role as king . \\n▁ i left my room behind and , as i 'd walked down the corridor to find him , my sweeping gaze landed on the two figures in the front yard . \\n▁ a caravan of delivery trucks streamed in one by one , and david and arthur stepped up to sign for packages that were , judging by the volume of plants and boxes of beakers they were checking , the stock for arthur 's new herbalist lab and greenhouse . \\n▁ clearly , david was n't coming up to talk to me anytime soon . \\n▁ he 'd given me all he was required to give : the facts . \\n▁ he 'd brush it off and keep going now , duty - bound to operate in a ` business as usual ' manner . \\n▁ the way he always did . \\n▁ come what may . \\n▁ he looked up from time to time as i paced the floors in front of the windows , and i pretended not to notice him trying to catch my gaze - walking with my head down , my fingers tightly clasped around the golden apple . \\n▁ he did care how i felt , for what it was worth . \\n▁ i knew it mattered to him how much this hurt me , but i could map the conversation out in my head that we 'd have even if he did actually come up here to comfort me . \\n▁ nothing i did or argued could change what had to be done . \\n▁ i had two options : accept his death quietly and with grace , or demonstrate my inner child by kicking and screaming about it until david was gone . \\n▁ down in the yard , a large truck arrived , and a small group of men ran eagerly toward it , tapping the edges before it even stopped . \\n▁ they were all smiling and laughing , talking with enough animation that i could almost read their lips . \\n▁ arthur seemed more excited than the others , though . \\n▁ david had blessed him with the lab and greenhouse he 'd applied for over the last hundred years passed , then gone and denied his own brother the same . \\n▁ i felt hurt for jason . \\n▁ he deserved better than what he put up with here , and the truth about his brother 's future had hit him harder than even i expected . \\n▁ it just seemed like only jason and i really understood what it meant - really knew what it would be like to lose david . \\n▁ maybe arthur understood , too , but he seemed to accept that this was david 's duty . \\n▁ as if he 'd accepted it long ago , like david had . \\n▁ the fact was , david would go away in a month or so , pack the dagger into his bag and … i took a quick breath , dropping the apple to the ground by my feet with a solid thud . \\n▁ the dagger . \\n▁ arthur gave him the duplicate . \\n▁ the fake . \\n▁ i ran to the window and pressed my hands and nose against it , watching arthur in the front yard by the pond . \\n▁ maybe he was n't all that supportive of david 's plan after all . \\n▁ maybe he had his own in effect right now . \\n▁ but if david journeyed to romania with the fake dagger and jammed it through drake 's heart , only one of them would die . \\n▁ and it would n't be drake . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ david 's firm fingers wrapped my arm , gently tugging me away from the window . \\n▁ but when i turned around to look into his eyes , a pair of warm , caramel one 's stared back . \\n▁ ` ` falcon . '' \\n▁ ` ` you need some rest , my queen , '' he said , and a flicker of something other than business flashed in his eyes for a moment . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve been out here since dawn . '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' i glanced over my shoulder out the window . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't sleep . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he dropped my arm , stepping back into professional mode . \\n▁ ` ` but you at least need to lie down . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ so i can wait for my husband to die from a more comfortable position for you ? '' \\n▁ i said spitefully . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , does my pacing offend you somehow ? '' \\n▁ he bent down and picked up my golden apple , studying it for a second before planting it firmly in my hand . \\n▁ ` ` do n't do this , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i swiped a hand across my nose . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be a spoilt brat . \\n▁ you ' ve made so much progress lately . \\n▁ this is n't you . \\n▁ you 're hurt , i get that , but there 's no sense in behaving like a child to express it . \\n▁ which is exactly what you 're doing . '' \\n▁ my shoulders dropped . \\n▁ i looked quickly down both ends of the hall and let out a long breath . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i ' m sorry , i just - '' ` ` come on . '' \\n▁ he grasped my upper arm and steered me toward my room . \\n▁ ` ` rest for a bit . \\n▁ the grief will still be there when you wake up . '' \\n▁ my chest caved a few times , turning the ache inside to an outward xxunk . \\n▁ i wanted so badly just to fall into falcon 's arms for a hug - just a pair of arms , anyone 's arms , to ease the caged , heavy feeling in my heart . \\n▁ but he would n't have any of that . \\n▁ i knew that . \\n▁ so , i sucked up the grief and opened my door , quietly thanking falcon before closing it and flopping down onto my bed - an ` ` acceptable '' place to grieve . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` you have to give david the real dagger ! '' \\n▁ i slammed arthur 's bedroom door behind me . \\n▁ the gentle hum of his violin stopped in an abrupt and high - pitched screech as he looked up in shock . \\n▁ ` ` and why on god 's good earth would i ever do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because he 's going to kill drake . '' \\n▁ i held strong , xxunk my feet as if standing tall on a rocky boat . \\n▁ ` ` if he has the wrong dagger , drake will kill him . '' \\n▁ arthur rested his violin in its stand by the fireplace and stood motionless for a moment , exhaling through his nose . \\n▁ ` ` arthur , he knows drake 's in romania . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he appeared by my side , and guided me by the wrist to the long oak table in the middle of the room . \\n▁ ` ` take a seat , my dear . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to sit , '' i said , sitting . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to promise me you 'll give him the real dagger . '' \\n▁ all arthur offered in response as he sat down across from me , though , was a long sigh into his fist ; his thoughts lost a million miles away . \\n▁ ` ` what has he told you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he told me his father knew about this blood curse and this connection to lilith , which means you had to have known , arthur , how can you not ? \\n▁ you - '' ` ` okay , i ' m going to have to stop you there , amara . '' \\n▁ he held his hand up . \\n▁ ` ` i knew about the cursed blood of knight , yes , and i argued with david for three hours about telling you the truth . \\n▁ he overruled me , princess , and you 're his wife . \\n▁ i ' ve no place going against his wishes . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i ' m your friend , '' i said in a shaky voice . \\n▁ ` ` does n't that count ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and that is precisely why i sat in that day jason was helping you read the scrolls . \\n▁ i hoped a hint of the truth would be enough to set your mind working , that maybe you would come to your own conclusions after that . '' \\n▁ ` ` but all it did was shatter my hopes of freeing the damned , arthur . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ and i learned an important lesson that day - to trust david when he says he knows what 's best for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he warned me that you were holding on to the hope that you could save the children to survive . \\n▁ i was wrong to let jason tell you as much as he did , but i did n't realise that until it was too late . '' \\n▁ i twiddled my thumbs , watching one go around the other for a second . \\n▁ ` ` you knew lilith when she was alive , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i did . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , surely you must know more about this contract and the promised child than you 're letting on . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know some things , but not from living in that time . \\n▁ i was not around for the death of lilith , or the events that led to it . \\n▁ but with decades of research , i ' ve collected some facts about it and made my own conclusions . '' \\n▁ ` ` then … do you know what drake wants with my child ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ but i have a theory . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m listening , '' i said , my voice peaking with interest . \\n▁ ` ` lilith killed anandene , and eventually promised her own child to drake as a means to end the suffering he caused in return . \\n▁ but why does he want her child as repayment for what she did to his wife ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` seems like an odd exchange . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ unless he planned to use the powerful blood of his immortal sister to restore the untethered soul of his beloved . '' \\n▁ my face went numb . \\n▁ ` ` restore ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i told you once that immortal souls are the one 's that reincarnate ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , unless the connection was severed . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ well , anandene 's body was killed , not necessarily her soul . '' \\n▁ ` ` so … how … i mean - '' i thought about all that . \\n▁ ` ` he wants to … what ? \\n▁ reincarnate anandene ? '' \\n▁ ` ` or insert her soul into your newborn child . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped . \\n▁ ` ` it would explain the queer requirements of conception , '' he added . \\n▁ ` ` the fact that it had to be born from the purest blood of a nobleman 's son . \\n▁ and it explains why drake has kept xxunk , a known xxunk enemy , around all these years . '' \\n▁ ` ` what would a witch have to do with a baby and a soul insertion ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he needs her to complete the ritual . '' \\n▁ ` ` ritual ? '' \\n▁ that sounded so much scarier than using the words soul insertion , conjuring up images of lightning and stone tables and long cloaks . \\n▁ ` ` is … is this kind of thing possible ? '' \\n▁ arthur nodded . \\n▁ ` ` drake performed this ritual once before . \\n▁ but it failed . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , who was it ? \\n▁ what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know only a few details , but it has been whispered that drake attempted it on his mother 's soul . '' \\n▁ ` ` so … what happened to her then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do not know , princess . '' \\n▁ he folded his fingers together on the table . \\n▁ ` ` i do know that a certain kind of magic runs in his veins , in any born immortal 's veins , but he would not have the power to perform such a spell . \\n▁ he needs a witch - needs xxunk , and i fear that , once he 's done with her , he plans to dispose of her . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong with that ? '' \\n▁ i said , then rolled my wrist out . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , aside from the obvious - her being dead . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk will not go easily . \\n▁ she would be only too aware what drake plans for her , and she will be taking steps to prevent this . '' \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ arthur sat back , resting his knuckles by his lips , studying me as if considering how much to disclose . \\n▁ ` ` she may be looking for an immortal vessel of her own , possibly the one drake plans to take from you . '' \\n▁ i touched my belly . \\n▁ ` ` so , she 's going to insert herself into my baby ? '' \\n▁ arthur nodded once , his eyes lost in thought . \\n▁ ` ` after all my research and contemplation , this is my latest conclusion . '' \\n▁ he reached across the table for my hand ; i placed it in his . \\n▁ ` ` of course , i could be very , very wrong . '' \\n▁ i squeezed his hand and sat back . \\n▁ ` ` it sounds pretty scary . \\n▁ but also very plausible . \\n▁ what did david say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he said it was of no consequence - said that drake would be dead before it was a problem . '' \\n▁ ` ` but even if we kill drake , what about xxunk ? '' \\n▁ arthur laughed . \\n▁ ` ` if he 's not around to kill her , she wo n't need a new body . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` so , if we kill drake , does that void the contract ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ if you kill him with the dagger . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ why not just kill him with venom ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because , my dear , think back . \\n▁ try to remember what i told you . '' \\n▁ he gave me a second to think about it . \\n▁ ` ` that the dagger severs the connection of the xxunk soul from this world , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` if you simply kill drake , his soul will reincarnate , or could possibly be transferred into another immortal body later , and the contract will be reinstated . '' \\n▁ ` ` so the contract is bound to his soul ? '' \\n▁ ` ` and to lilith 's . '' \\n▁ i exhaled , my shoulders sinking . \\n▁ ` ` falling on her descendants until it 's fulfilled . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` damn . '' \\n▁ i rested my head in my palms . \\n▁ ` ` i was really hoping to find a way around using that dagger . '' \\n▁ ` ` as was david , my dear . \\n▁ he and i have exhausted all these options . '' \\n▁ ` ` why did n't he tell me about the whole soul insertion ritual ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it is only a theory at this point , and david does act on a whim . \\n▁ i came up with this theory , but i - '' he laughed , jerking his head toward the fireplace and the stack of books beside it . \\n▁ ` ` i may have spent too long poring over fantasy . '' \\n▁ i slowly looked back from the books . \\n▁ ` ` so , what do we do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` like i said : focus on what we know , protect your unborn child and , rather than dig through the depths of drake 's lies and plans , kill him . '' \\n▁ ` ` and kill david in the process . '' \\n▁ my sharp words travelled across the oak top of arthur 's table and hit him right in the heart , making his body shudder . \\n▁ ` ` i lost him once . '' \\n▁ he looked down . \\n▁ ` ` and i swore i would not lose him again . \\n▁ but it seems we are left with little choice . '' \\n▁ and that left only one thing to gain in david 's inventory of death . \\n▁ ` ` so you 'll give him the right dagger ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you have my word . '' \\n▁ i nodded once and , feeling the rise of emotions i just wanted to control , placed both hands on the tabletop , stood slowly , and walked away . \\n▁ ` ` amara ? '' \\n▁ i stopped , holding the door ajar . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' i said , and as the door closed behind me , the tears i could hold no longer streamed down my face . \\n▁ i felt like a leaf in a pond , held down by a stick - too tired to come back up , too alive to just sink down and give up . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ blade left his guard post and scooped me up in a warm embrace . \\n▁ ` ` do n't cry , little queen . \\n▁ please , do n't cry . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't lose him , blade . \\n▁ i ca n't do this , '' i sobbed into his shirt , my arms and hands shaking , so tight with grief my skin was red . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not strong enough . '' \\n▁ ` ` you are , do n't you know ? '' \\n▁ he placed a hand over the side of my face , cupping my ear firmly . \\n▁ ` ` you 're stronger than anyone gives you credit for . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i do n't want to be , blade . \\n▁ maybe if i was n't - maybe if david knew how bad this would hurt me , how much it would kill me , he would n't go . \\n▁ he would n't - '' ` ` he has no choice . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i sunk down , tearing away from blade 's arms , and sat on the ground with my head in my hands . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but i have no control . \\n▁ none . \\n▁ and i hate it ! '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ david 's smooth voice came past blade 's shoulder ; he squatted down in front of me and , as his eyes met mine , i saw them flicker - felt him reach into my mind and see everything that just happened . \\n▁ he sat down beside me , the hall empty around us , free of guards , maids , friends , even blade was gone . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , ara . '' \\n▁ i hiccupped into my palms , rolling down to rest my head in david 's lap . \\n▁ ` ` nothing 's ever going to make this okay , is it ? '' \\n▁ he said , his hand hovering above my hair as if he did n't want to break me down further by touching me . \\n▁ the only answer i could give was a shake of my head , keeping my face hidden . \\n▁ and we sat there alone , our backs against arthur 's door , watching the sun turn the walls orange then black as the night consumed us . \\n▁ living things watched me pass - the all - seeing eyes of nature following me as i ran fast through the enchanted forest . \\n▁ my feet barely touched the floor , the speed of this immortal body taking me from the tree line outside the garden of lilith to the endless valley of trees beyond the stone . \\n▁ i stopped on the face of a cliff , my palm against a trunk , folding over to catch my breath . \\n▁ the life of nature ran violently through my veins , charging them with energy , while the exertion of my run simultaneously drained me . \\n▁ this body was an engine that could not be idle - could not run far enough away from the problems to fall down and care only about the physical pain . \\n▁ i could n't walk through the fields or the trees without the spirits of nature making my heart ache , magnifying every emotion . \\n▁ nothing would make this better . \\n▁ it was like dreaming while awake , and no matter how hard i pinched myself , i just could n't get back to the world where none of this was happening . \\n▁ i slid down the tree and let both legs dangle into the mouth of the valley . \\n▁ i knew this place was unnatural . \\n▁ i knew that if i flew a plane over this side of xxunk island , there 'd be no valley . \\n▁ but beyond the stone of truth , it seemed the world went on forever . \\n▁ it felt like a parallel world out here , a secret parallel world , because i was , from what i 'd gathered , the only one who 'd seen it - almost as if it were a gift only for those connected to the stone . \\n▁ the cuts and bruises on my bare feet healed as i sat , and the scrapes and gashes on my arms , hands , and cheeks tingled as they sealed themselves shut . \\n▁ my hair was frizzy , i could actually feel it , and i was sure my face was covered in dirt and blood because , when i wiped my tears away , my hands came back brown . \\n▁ ` ` i could n't save him , eve , '' i said , feeling her spirit beside me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't cry , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m trying not to . '' \\n▁ i wiped my face again and held my hands out , showing them to the forest . \\n▁ ` ` but i ca n't stop them from coming . \\n▁ how do i do that ? '' \\n▁ my heart jumped then , when her small , almost transparent hand landed in mine . \\n▁ ` ` the apple holds the key , '' she said . \\n▁ i looked up from our locked fingertips and into her bright blue eyes ; they were just like mine - her face heart - shaped and so youthful it hurt to look at her , knowing she was dead - almost as if my soul quivered , bleeding inside . \\n▁ ` ` what does that mean , eve ? '' \\n▁ she reached out slowly with her other hand and placed it flat across my belly . \\n▁ ` ` the apple holds the key . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you mean the child ? '' \\n▁ i said , cupping my hand over hers , but the tiny , cold touch of eve was gone . \\n▁ i looked up to the place beside me where she sat a second ago , hearing the birds sing louder as the pink light across the trees turned bright yellow under the late morning sun . \\n▁ i knew i 'd sat here longer than i thought . \\n▁ i knew david would be looking for me , worried . \\n▁ i knew i 'd get a lecture from him and everyone else who treated me like a baby when i returned , but i did n't care . \\n▁ i hugged my knees to my chest and laid my cheek against them , thinking about the keyhole in the golden apple . \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ i called to the lone figure heading toward the lower west wing . \\n▁ he stopped in the darkened entranceway just below the stairs , watching me descend . \\n▁ ` ` what you doin ' up so late , b - ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk ? '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , sorry . '' \\n▁ he shook his head at himself . \\n▁ ` ` i got ta quit calling you baby . '' \\n▁ i stepped off the stair and stood beside him , feeling suddenly so much smaller at the base of his bulk and height . \\n▁ ` ` david threaten to tear your arm off , huh ? '' \\n▁ mike slowly folded one arm into his body , then the other . \\n▁ ` ` i dunno what 's gotten into him lately . \\n▁ he 's , to put it bluntly , he 's scary . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , he 's the same david he 's always been . \\n▁ we 're just meeting the councillor . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i ' m not sure i like king david . '' \\n▁ i smiled , pushing his arms down from their fold . \\n▁ ` ` give it time . \\n▁ he 's been through a lot the last few months . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ so , what did you want ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , um . '' \\n▁ i looked back up the stairs then at mike again . \\n▁ ` ` david ran off the other day because you had a problem with the damned . \\n▁ just wondering - '' ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ he touched my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` it was just harrison . \\n▁ he wet his bed and wanted king david . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth slowly . \\n▁ ` ` poor baby . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's all right . \\n▁ he did n't want you to know , though . '' \\n▁ ` ` me ? \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ mike 's sideways smile warmed his whole face . \\n▁ ` ` duh ! \\n▁ you 're a girl . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i nodded , but my face still wrinkled with confusion . \\n▁ ` ` but - '' ` ` never mind it , ara . '' \\n▁ he turned slightly and started walking away . \\n▁ ` ` it 's all sorted now . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i called to the back of his head . \\n▁ ` ` well , thanks for the chat . \\n▁ nice to see you . \\n▁ hope we can do it again sometime in the next century . '' \\n▁ i heard him laugh softly , throwing his hand up in a gentle wave goodbye . \\n▁ he must have been really busy . \\n▁ but i meant those words as more than just a joke . \\n▁ since i 'd fallen off the lighthouse , he and i had spent less and less time chatting casually . \\n▁ he really had stepped into the role of employee and not so much friend . \\n▁ ` ` miss you , '' i added quietly and turned to walk back up the stairs . \\n▁ the whole manor was quiet , almost desolate . \\n▁ the lilithian people finally at rest . \\n▁ they had their queen , the possibility of an heir - one they still believed was foretold to transform vampires into humans - and they would soon be rid of their immortal enemy , even though this meant losing their king , it was , to them , a worthy death . \\n▁ and a king could always be replaced . \\n▁ it was replacing the love of my life that i had a problem with . \\n▁ but , all that aside , those living in the manor were finally free . \\n▁ morgaine had achieved nearly everything she set out to do centuries ago , yet her success made me feel hollow . \\n▁ my life so far had been lived around fulfilling this prophecy and freeing my people from the darkness of drake 's reign . \\n▁ now that had been achieved , what was next ? \\n▁ day - to - day , right ? \\n▁ just ruling , eating and sleeping . \\n▁ wake up , rinse and repeat . \\n▁ over and over again for the rest of forever , alone . \\n▁ i turned the corner into the openness off the great library , and as i started up the stairs to the second floor , stopped and put my foot back down on the ground . \\n▁ the secret door to the scroll room was open , candlelight and laughter lilting up the stone stairs from within . \\n▁ ` ` hello ? '' \\n▁ i called down the hole , coming to stop on the cusp , with my arms folded . \\n▁ ` ` down here , sweetheart , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` can i … is it okay if i come down ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ my head led the way toward david and the other voice , my fingertips trailing the bricks behind me . \\n▁ ` ` should n't you be sleeping ? \\n▁ you have a long trip tomorrow . '' \\n▁ ` ` vampires do n't require as much sleep as your kind . '' \\n▁ david placed his arm around my waist , pulling me close to his body , keeping his eyes on the notes in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` i found it ! '' \\n▁ jason popped out from the door to our right and stopped dead when he saw me . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` jason . '' \\n▁ i nodded politely . \\n▁ ` ` hi . \\n▁ um … what brings you down here ? '' \\n▁ he walked over and laid a scroll out in front of david , but his whole body was kind of stiff , tiny particles of tension clinging to every inch of his skin 's surface . \\n▁ ` ` woke up alone , went to get something to read , heard laughing , thought i 'd investigate . '' \\n▁ he smiled at me , eyeing david carefully after to see if he noticed . \\n▁ ` ` did david fill you in ? '' \\n▁ ` ` on what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` look . '' \\n▁ david pointed to a page of indecipherable scribble , made less visible in the flickering candlelight . \\n▁ ` ` we found out more about morgana . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i turned the corner of the page , leaning over it as if i could actually read that language . \\n▁ ` ` and … what does it say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's a birth record . \\n▁ see ? '' \\n▁ his finger moved along the page , marking the words . \\n▁ ` ` morgana xxunk . \\n▁ born on the sabbath day to lilith of xxunk and lord xxunk xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk ? \\n▁ but … i thought christian , lilith 's first husband , was the father of morgana . '' \\n▁ ` ` evidently , we were misinformed . '' \\n▁ he stood back from leaning over the table . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? \\n▁ do you know who lord xxunk was ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` he was a very powerful witch , '' his voice pitched in an interested tone on the last word . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong with him being a witch ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing , but it explains why morgana never survived . '' \\n▁ i groaned , rolling my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` that still does n't make any sense to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` witches are mortals , '' jason explained , handing me a piece of paper . \\n▁ i unrolled it and the face of a stern - looking man stared back up at me in lines of grey and black , his long hair framing his face , falling around a frilly collar . \\n▁ ` ` according to natural law , those with the power of the earth can not be immortal . \\n▁ any who ' ve attempted spells or rituals to prolong life have met consistently with severe and often hellish consequences . '' \\n▁ ` ` right , '' david cut in . \\n▁ ` ` so , what would happen to a child conceived of a mortal witch and an immortal vampire ? '' \\n▁ my eyebrows slid across my forehead , nearly meeting in the middle . \\n▁ ` ` so you think morgana died before her body made the change ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'd bet my life on it , '' david said , and jason and i both looked up at him quickly . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ he shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` distasteful , david , '' i said , laying the picture of lord xxunk down . \\n▁ david , having realised he just made a pun about his own , now inevitable demise , laughed softly to himself and started rolling scrolls . \\n▁ i let myself digest this information , thinking about so many random other bits all at once , that when two of them crashed together , a conclusion sparked . \\n▁ ` ` what if she 's not dead ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ david said , tying a ribbon around an old , yellowing scroll . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , what if she lived ? \\n▁ what if she could n't be immortal but maybe aged at a slower rate than a human ? '' \\n▁ jason and david exchanged glances . \\n▁ ` ` how old would she be if she were actually alive today ? '' \\n▁ i finished . \\n▁ david scratched his nose , bending down a little to lean his elbow on the chair back . \\n▁ ` ` why , ara ? \\n▁ what 's your point ? '' \\n▁ i held my smile for a minute . \\n▁ ` ` what if she 's drake 's witch - the one you know as xxunk ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you know of xxunk ? '' \\n▁ jason practically gasped . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ i looked up at david , not sure if i was allowed to say anything . \\n▁ ` ` arthur told me . '' \\n▁ david turned at the shoulder to look at jason . \\n▁ ` ` ara , did arthur say if he 'd ever actually seen xxunk ? '' \\n▁ jase asked in tone soft enough for a child . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` all he said was that she 's very old and very powerful , and that he wanted to get his hands on her . '' \\n▁ ` ` so she 's real ? '' \\n▁ jason looked at david . \\n▁ ` ` so it would seem , '' david said , playing it like he and arthur had never discussed such things . \\n▁ ` ` what 's the big deal if she is real ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve only heard rumours of the great witch xxunk xxunk . \\n▁ but , none were good , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` some say she conjured curses and plagues , killed babies - that she corrupted and influenced the church back in the days before christ , and there have been rumours that she can change form and become something else . '' \\n▁ ` ` like a snake ? '' \\n▁ i asked , remembering my walk of faith . \\n▁ ` ` any creature . '' \\n▁ ` ` but … she 's drake 's prisoner , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` or friend . '' \\n▁ ` ` and … is that bad news for us ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's bad news for any vampire - even drake - if he gets on the wrong side of her , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` her mere existence is bad for the entire human race , ara , '' david added . \\n▁ ` ` she 's unnaturally old - been around longer than us . '' \\n▁ he motioned between himself and jason . \\n▁ ` ` and , rumour has it , as hideous as a millennium - old steak sandwich , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` which is a perfect example of what happens to witches when they meddle in the natural order of things , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` in what way ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , aside from being so old her skin is as thin as paper , her soul is also demented from the inside out , like rotting fruit , ara , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` witchcraft eats the body and the soul when used for dark purposes , '' david finished . \\n▁ ` ` but she is much too old to have once been the child morgana . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ well , there goes that theory . '' \\n▁ i moved my shoulders in a noncommittal gesture . \\n▁ ` ` so … if her soul is so rotten and dark , what would happen if she sanctioned herself a youthful , immortal body to occupy ? '' \\n▁ david went stiff , growing taller , his hands stopping short of the scrolls they were about to grab . \\n▁ ` ` i knew it , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` you two know more than you 're letting on . '' \\n▁ ` ` when it 's your concern , brother , i will include you . '' \\n▁ i slapped david 's arm . \\n▁ ` ` be nice . \\n▁ jason can know if he wants . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , xxunk wo n't get the chance to insert herself into our child . \\n▁ here . '' \\n▁ he handed a pile of scrolls to jason . \\n▁ ` ` put these away . '' \\n▁ jason just groaned , grabbing another stack of paper off the lamp table as he walked away . \\n▁ when the storage room door closed behind him with a high squeak , david turned to me . \\n▁ ` ` ara , for xxunk to insert a soul into a living being , she would need to xxunk the one already in place - something that can only be done with the dagger of xxunk . \\n▁ once i use it on drake , its power will die with him . '' \\n▁ ` ` and with you . '' \\n▁ he leaned in and kissed my brow , closing his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` give me an alternative , my love , and i 'd take it . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , we could - '' ` ` a real alternative , '' he said sharply and walked away , not noticing jason behind him until they bumped shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , '' he said , and closed the storage room door gently behind him . \\n▁ jason walked toward me , his steps graceful and light as the wind , and leaned against the table , folding his arms . \\n▁ ` ` do n't keep pressing him about xxunk xxunk , ara , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` he 'll never agree to it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` then why do you keep bringing it up ? '' \\n▁ ` ` guess i ' m just hoping . '' \\n▁ ` ` do yourself a favour - '' we both looked over at david through the windows , rummaging around in the storage area . \\n▁ ` ` stop hoping . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't . '' \\n▁ he sighed , standing up again . \\n▁ ` ` he 's worried about you . '' \\n▁ ` ` in what way ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he knows how bad you 're hurting . '' \\n▁ ` ` good , '' i said , smiling . \\n▁ ` ` maybe he 'll stay then . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he said casually , packing away scrolls . \\n▁ ` ` he wo n't . \\n▁ he 'll just go to his death with the burden of your aching soul on his . '' \\n▁ my arms dropped to my sides , but i plastered a smile on as david came back in . \\n▁ ` ` we good ? '' \\n▁ he said to jason , laying his hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` yup . \\n▁ i 'll finish up with these and lock the door on my way out . '' \\n▁ ` ` thanks , bro . '' \\n▁ ` ` any time . '' \\n▁ jase waved and headed into the storage room , leaving us alone in the total silence . \\n▁ the seconds - hand on david 's watch ticked , keeping time to the beat of my heart , offering the comfort of noise in a completely wordless moment . \\n▁ i held my thoughts back from david , and he did the same with his own . \\n▁ when he realised i was practically paralysed , unable to speak for fear of saying something he did n't want to hear , he slid his touch down my arm and scooped up my hand . \\n▁ ` ` bed ? '' \\n▁ i squeezed his fingertips , deciding right then that any pain i felt for losing him had to be felt alone . \\n▁ this was hard enough for david without me adding my broken heart to it . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ but i do n't wan na sleep . '' \\n▁ ` ` what shall we do then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` xxrep 3 u m , well , i have a few things i want to try out before my only company is a cat . '' \\n▁ ` ` a cat ? '' \\n▁ david looked utterly confused . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i started walking . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't expect me to get married again once you 're gone , do you ? '' \\n▁ he stayed behind for a second , but a burly laugh broke the silence in the room . \\n▁ it seemed like forever since i 'd heard him laugh in such a carefree way , maybe even as far back as our last day by the lake . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ well , in that case , '' he said , stepping up to take my hand again . \\n▁ ` ` there are a few things i ' ve always wanted to do to you , mon amour . '' \\n▁ ` ` mm . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes , feeling the tingle of his words . \\n▁ ` ` speak french to me , and you can do whatever you want . '' \\n▁ he leaned in and whispered something in my ear , and i did n't care what it was , did n't care that the squeeze of his hand on the small of my back sent a thousand hot ideas into my mind because , whatever he said , it was definitely not in english . \\n▁ chapter five we stood against each other , arms by our sides , the backs of our fingers touching only by the finest hairs between them . \\n▁ we were like two individual flames meeting before blending as one - the heat intense but our skin immune , our bodies two , but our souls completely intertwined . \\n▁ my cotton nightdress felt like air along my craving skin - like a breath i wanted to exhale so i could feel the closeness of david 's soon - to - be naked body against mine . \\n▁ we both knew what we were about to do was n't just for the sake of being close or fulfilling primal needs : it went much deeper than that . \\n▁ the first time we ever made love with the hope we might fall pregnant , i was scared and unsure that 's what i really wanted . \\n▁ and every time after that i 'd either been afraid it would n't happen , or afraid that , if it did , it 'd mean losing him . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ david asked softly into the crown of my head , his warm breath forcing my eyes closed . \\n▁ i laid a hand across my belly , shaking slightly . \\n▁ ` ` my love ? '' \\n▁ he lifted my chin . \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ it had all changed . \\n▁ every reason i ever had for wanting to make love to him had changed . \\n▁ i could finally hope it would bring the blessing of a little girl , and i was n't scared , not about anything , not about being a young mom . \\n▁ not about going it alone , without david . \\n▁ i was n't even scared that i 'd mess it all up and fail as a parent . \\n▁ i opened my eyes and smiled , melting the concern in his . \\n▁ ` ` i can imagine it , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` imagine her ? '' \\n▁ his hand cupped mine . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i can finally imagine what she 'll be like . '' \\n▁ his hand moved from my belly to wipe a tear from my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` let 's not imagine anymore , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i … i ' m afraid , though , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` of what ? '' \\n▁ his green eyes searched mine , so intense with depth and wisdom and strength that i felt silly for feeling fear when i should be thinking of nothing else but this moment . \\n▁ i was afraid it would n't happen , though - afraid our baby was n't possible , no matter what we did . \\n▁ but something in his eyes just made it all okay , like he 'd take care of it . \\n▁ like nothing was impossible while i had him . \\n▁ ` ` close your eyes , '' he whispered in my ear , guiding my hand onto his heart . \\n▁ ` ` let me make love to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` only if you let it last for forever . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't promise you forever , ara . \\n▁ you know that . '' \\n▁ ` ` then at least make it last until the dawn . '' \\n▁ ` ` that , '' he said with a slowly shaping grin . \\n▁ ` ` i can promise . '' \\n▁ i leaned back a little and took all of him in : he looked magnificent as king , as if he 'd grown an inch taller since he was sworn in and maybe even jumped a few points on the sex - appeal - o - meter . \\n▁ the stubble tracing his jawline had grown in over the day , shadowing his face like immortality 's version of a calvin klein model . \\n▁ the white shirt he was wearing had been sewn from a fabric so soft it was almost a part of his body , falling over the contours of his chest like skin , leaving all the warmth on the surface as if he were naked already . \\n▁ i felt him under my hand , his chest moulding the cup of palm , the shirt parting at the buttons , inviting my fingertips inside . \\n▁ david smoothed the tip of his thumb from just under my earlobe and down my throat , his lips softly pushing my nightdress off my shoulder a little . \\n▁ ` ` i still ca n't believe how well i know every inch of you . '' \\n▁ gravity drew the fabric down the step he had n't , and my skin fell open to the warm summer night as the top of the dress bunched around my elbows , leaving everything from my hips upward exposed and tingling slightly with little bumps . \\n▁ both his hands trailed firmly down my back , following its shape like a hand tracing a distant skyline of smooth rolling hills . \\n▁ i held my breath , afraid to breathe a moment of this realness . \\n▁ my hand sat against his chest , his body solid and alive beneath it , yet my mind floated along the memory of the first time i saw him smile - the gentle half - turn of his lip , the way he 'd hide the thoughts he could hear , trying so hard not to give anything away about how they made him feel . \\n▁ i saw him as that boy i sat beside at the piano on my first day of school , felt the ache rise from my gut to my chest , knowing i could never go back . \\n▁ all that was gone . \\n▁ and those memories were all i 'd have left soon , never to make any more . \\n▁ when i looked up , the hold of his round , black eyes on mine nearly burned a hole in me , his tears clouding them , so restrained i just wanted to cry for him . \\n▁ but he blinked and they slipped past his lashes , falling eternally away to the land of forgotten things . \\n▁ in this moment , we were here , alive , and one day , he 'd be gone . \\n▁ i 'd stand here in this memory , touching the air as if i could feel him there , but i 'd only be able to imagine what it felt like once to know his warmth , to feel the way his hands moved over my body in ways i could n't even dream up . \\n▁ and i knew he felt every breath of my pain as he read the thoughts that provoked it . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll never be far away , ara . '' \\n▁ he drew me closer by the small of my back , and as my hands dropped to my sides , the nightgown slipped past , falling at our feet . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll leave a part of myself behind in you . '' \\n▁ ` ` and every time i look at her , i 'll die a little more . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you wo n't . '' \\n▁ he kissed my hair . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll know what it feels like to love again . '' \\n▁ i stood on my toes , reaching up to cup my hands behind his neck , our lips connecting a breath later . \\n▁ but the kiss only broke my heart - the supple warmth of his lips , so lovingly wrapped up in mine , were so exquisite in their hold that the only emotion they could possibly convey was love : unending , unconditional love . \\n▁ the kind of love i would never have again . \\n▁ i angled my chin so i could feel the slight prickle of his stubble , a feeling that always made him real , present - one i could always find when i closed my eyes , even if he was n't here . \\n▁ every breath of that kiss would become a moment locked away - stored for the day it would only be something i opened at night , when i lay in bed with my eyes closed - our forever lived in a series of events that already happened . \\n▁ ` ` but we have tonight , '' he said , waking me from my thought with a firm hand cupping my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` my love , do n't go there . \\n▁ just be here , in this moment , with me . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ david 's hands went under my bottom , prompting me to jump up and wrap my legs around his hips . \\n▁ he carried me slowly to the bed , falling down on top of me ; the sheets and pillows rising up like clouds around us . \\n▁ i felt the softness of them under my bare skin , each tiny inch tingling as if this was the first touch . \\n▁ and david 's mouth found mine again , the sweet kisses growing with the desire heating his blood , his hand folding around my breast , smoothing a path for his lips to follow . \\n▁ ` ` there are so many things we ' ve never done , '' he said under the kiss . \\n▁ ` ` so many i planned to do right now , but - '' he leaned back and smiled down at me . \\n▁ ` ` tonight , i think i just wan na love you . '' \\n▁ those words rushed into my heart , taking the thoughts and desires he showed me earlier , and tossing them aside . \\n▁ all i wanted now was to feel his bare chest pressed to mine , his hands on my hips , our bodies connected closer than humanly , or xxunk possible . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i guided him gently backward and rolled onto my knees , sweeping his shirt up his waist . \\n▁ ` ` then we need you naked . '' \\n▁ ` ` you read my mind . '' \\n▁ he tossed his shirt aside and brought his arms back down to his sides - his ribs expanding , showing the skeleton beneath . \\n▁ ` ` you 're so thin now , david . '' \\n▁ i cupped his ribs with both hands and kissed the hollow between his xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` that happens when you 're stressed about leaving the love of your life . '' \\n▁ i stopped kissing and just rested my brow against his soft belly for a moment , feeling my hair sweep off my face under david 's fingertips . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be sad , my love . \\n▁ remember ? \\n▁ tonight is n't about the future . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's pretty hard to ignore . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i heard a smile shape his words . \\n▁ ` ` i think i can take your mind off it . '' \\n▁ i laughed breathily and , with tears wetting my lips , began my important task of kissing every inch of his skin from his ribs to his jeans again . \\n▁ as i reached his belly button , he drew his stomach in , trying not laugh . \\n▁ ` ` does that tickle ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , but do n't stop . '' \\n▁ he smoothed both thumbs down my head , resting his fingertips gently to the base of my skull , and i felt him grow harder near my throat - pushing against the zipper of his jeans . \\n▁ i could smell him , almost taste him - the sweet chocolate mixed with the familiar but very slight scent of the day 's sweat . \\n▁ he 'd never let me get this close before , never opened himself up this way . \\n▁ it was as if there were no walls between us now ; we were finally free to explore all those things we 'd been afraid to share . \\n▁ he 'd even stopped waxing all his hair off , his chest now sprouting a few hairs around his ni * * les - my tongue noticing the fine trail from his navel downward . \\n▁ i pinched the top of his zipper then and slid it down , rolling the waist of his jeans and briefs past his hips , seeing the head of his penis grow as my fingertips brushed past it . \\n▁ and my blood boiled with a naughty idea . \\n▁ ` ` i can see what you 're thinking , my love . '' \\n▁ he stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` i want to know what it feels like , '' i said , half suggesting , half asking . \\n▁ ` ` ara , you know how i feel about that . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i looked at the patch of dark hair below his v of muscles . \\n▁ ` ` but i just want to try it , just once . '' \\n▁ the thoughts in his mind flickered like a broken light for a second , finally deciding that it was better if i satisfied my curiosity with him than with another man after he was gone . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he exhaled , and tangled his fingers in my hair , guiding my mouth toward him . \\n▁ i had no idea what to actually do , and was n't really sure what to expect , either , but as i delicately wrapped my fingers around him , following his length to the base , i was no longer afraid i 'd do it wrong . \\n▁ none of it mattered . \\n▁ there was no self - consciousness here . \\n▁ not between us . \\n▁ we were in love . \\n▁ we were married , and if i was n't perfect , it just did n't matter anymore . \\n▁ i knew he 'd love me anyway . \\n▁ i wet my lips and guided him closer , closing my mouth around him as he let out a quiet gasp . \\n▁ his hands shook against my head , his thighs clenching to hold himself up on the squishy bed , and my naked skin tightened with bumps , cooled by the air from his nose , the draught deeper , stronger each time my tongue made circles . \\n▁ ` ` that . \\n▁ feels - '' he drew tight breaths through his teeth . \\n▁ ` ` amazing . '' \\n▁ my shoulders relaxed a little then , and as i moved my grip down the length of him , i felt him grow harder - the salty liquid thickening slightly under my tongue . \\n▁ ` ` aw , ara . '' \\n▁ his hips pressed closer to my face , his hand cupping the back of my head as he went deeper into my mouth , stopping where my tongue blocked my throat . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure i can take anymore , '' he said , and slowly eased himself from my mouth , leaning down to kiss me softly after . \\n▁ ` ` that felt way too good . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i straightened my spine to meet him face to face , and leaned back a bit , sliding my tongue across the moisture left behind . \\n▁ he nodded , gently moving me backward on the bed . \\n▁ and i saw the thoughts in his mind then - saw him imagine sweeping me down onto my back and sliding my underwear off , tossing them across the room - both of us laughing as he pictured them landing on the lampshade . \\n▁ ` ` lay back so i can taste you , '' he ordered sweetly . \\n▁ i tucked my thumbs into my undies and slid them off as i landed on my back , parting my legs for him . \\n▁ but his eyes moved to my belly instead , his hands flowing swiftly to land under his gaze , stopping there for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to do this right for once , ara , and we 're gon na have a baby . '' \\n▁ ` ` i feel that , too , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` i think this time it 'll happen . '' \\n▁ he leaned down and kissed my stomach , pressing his lips firmly into the skin just above my pubic bone . \\n▁ i held onto him , winding my fingertips through his hair . \\n▁ ` ` god , your scent is so familiar , '' he said in that deep , david - y tone , moving his lips down a few inches , stealing my breath as his tongue parted the hairs in one long sweep upward . \\n▁ ` ` and you taste so lovely i could kiss you here for hours . '' \\n▁ my whole body shivered , my legs spreading wider than i knew they could . \\n▁ i felt his finger slide in and brush a part that sent the shiver deeper , expanding the muscles inside me . \\n▁ i could smell it - the scent of sex and desire , like a cloud of heat in the dying summer air around us . \\n▁ and as i drew a breath , committing it to memory , felt it suddenly on my lips , tasted it on my tongue under david 's mouth against mine . \\n▁ it did n't really have much of a taste , or maybe i just did n't notice it , but it left my mind as soon as it entered , because david gently guided himself inside me , filling my body with the hardness that had been in my mouth only minutes ago . \\n▁ i wrapped my legs around his hips , digging my fingertips into the skin on his back , bunching it up tightly - my own little handful of david . \\n▁ for once , i owned this moment - owned the love , the energy , the truth finally between us . \\n▁ all the lies , all the secrets had come undone , and all that was left was his love for me , and mine for him . \\n▁ i did n't need to guard my thoughts . \\n▁ i did n't feel angry or resentful to him for keeping things from me . \\n▁ i felt closer to him than i ever had before , and i , finally , closed my eyes and prayed to the gods to bless us - bless this moment with a little baby girl . \\n▁ the past was coming undone with each breath he took , each movement against me . \\n▁ none of it mattered anymore . \\n▁ everything we 'd done to hurt each other was no longer important , because all that mattered right now , in this moment , was life . \\n▁ i came back down to earth , and david smiled his secret smile , seeing me suddenly faze back in . \\n▁ ` ` where do you go ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` you could n't see ? '' \\n▁ he wrapped his hands under my bottom and guided my hips closer to his , driving himself gently and slowly inside me , as if he did n't ever want this to end . \\n▁ ` ` i can never see your thoughts when you do that - when you faze out . \\n▁ it 's like you 're not even in there . '' \\n▁ ` ` maybe another out of body experience ? '' \\n▁ i suggested , making a little squeak at the end as he hit a very sensitive spot . \\n▁ he laughed , his lovely teeth showing , taking me back to our first date at betty 's for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i think this is really more of an out - of - this - world experience . '' \\n▁ i wrapped my legs tighter around him where they 'd slipped with the sweat . \\n▁ i did n't care how hot and sticky we were , though . \\n▁ it was his sweat and my sweat , and i just wanted him , all of him , to be all over me . \\n▁ ` ` i think we 're gon na need a change of sheets , '' he noted , looking at the bed under me . \\n▁ ` ` i dunno - '' i twisted my shoulder to the right and pressed my hand to his rib , shoving him down on the bed - flipping myself around so i came to rest with my legs either side of his hips . \\n▁ i felt him go deeper inside me in this position , saw the shock in his eyes as he studied my naked body on top of his . \\n▁ ` ` i think i like the idea of sleeping in a puddle of our own love . '' \\n▁ ` ` and i think i like you on top . '' \\n▁ he reached for my breast , and i grabbed his wrist , guiding it gently above his head , sliding both my hands up his and linking our fingers . \\n▁ the world moved with the rhythm i decided - a slow beat , each swing of my hips , each time i took him deeper inside me , like the roll of a wave on the shore , lap by lap , and i owned him . \\n▁ he lifted his hips to meet mine in the middle , closing his eyes as he set his pace to mine , enjoying me , enjoying my body . \\n▁ but he could n't just lay back and let me have full control . \\n▁ i knew that . \\n▁ i could feel the burn to govern this rising up in his hands like electricity . \\n▁ he broke free of my grip and cupped my waist , moving me to his own pace , much faster and a little harder than before . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i said , noticing something odd in his gaze . \\n▁ ` ` why are you looking at me like that ? '' \\n▁ the sharp smile made his eyes small , his head moving side to side for a second . \\n▁ ` ` you 're pretty darn hot when you 're being seductive , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that so ? '' \\n▁ i leaned forward and placed both hands on his chest , pushing down slightly so my hips rose off his - the warmth there going cool . \\n▁ ` ` yes , but - '' he flipped me through the air and landed on top of me , wrapping both my legs tightly around his hips . \\n▁ ` ` i much prefer creative control . '' \\n▁ ` ` creative control ? '' \\n▁ i said , a brow arching . \\n▁ he smiled down at my nakedness , shrugging one shoulder after . \\n▁ ` ` or maybe just control . '' \\n▁ a rush of excitement filled my gut . \\n▁ i kinda liked that , too . \\n▁ ` ` as long as you do n't start tying me up . '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed into cheeky slits . \\n▁ ` ` if i did , you would n't be able to stop me . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , i would , '' i said playfully , learning something new about myself then : i was n't sure i 'd want to stop him . \\n▁ ` ` i could just say no . '' \\n▁ he moved closer and pressed his lips to mine in a long , very slow and very wet kiss . \\n▁ ` ` not if i gag you . '' \\n▁ i went to say something witty , but could n't help laughing instead . \\n▁ ` ` xxrep 3 m , do n't do that . '' \\n▁ he leaned back a bit , closing his eyes , moving inside me again . \\n▁ ` ` you know how much that giggle stirs my inner vampire . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you know how much your inner vampire turns me on . '' \\n▁ i accompanied my statement with a quick flick of my nail down his chest , making him bleed . \\n▁ his chin rolled so his gaze settled on the cut . \\n▁ ` ` perhaps i will have to tie you up . '' \\n▁ my insides tightened . \\n▁ ` ` i dare you to . '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' he was too shocked to actually do it , though . \\n▁ he just closed his mouth , keeping a tight smile there , and ran his hand firmly down my arm , cupping my wrist and pinning it to the bed by my hip . \\n▁ ` ` i swore i 'd never be that way with you , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because that kind of thing is not for you . \\n▁ it 's for whores . '' \\n▁ i huffed . \\n▁ ` ` whores ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's just how i feel . '' \\n▁ he brought my wrist up above my head , his hand wrapping it so tight the blood filled my fingertips . \\n▁ ` ` then why are you holding me like that ? '' \\n▁ his fingers loosened . \\n▁ ` ` look , i love you , ara . \\n▁ and no matter how much i want to , i would never do anything disrespectful to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` maybe i like that kind of disrespect . '' \\n▁ he laughed , and the sweet warmth of his breath brushed over my lashes , xxunk my tongue a little with orange chocolate . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i think you ' ve always been a bit twisted , my love . \\n▁ perhaps it 's all the torture you suffered . '' \\n▁ ` ` then what 's your excuse ? '' \\n▁ i said , and he stopped pumping . \\n▁ ` ` you clearly want to do those things to me . '' \\n▁ he cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just mentally deranged from years of inflicting heinous punishments on the stripped and restrained bodies of lawbreakers . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , it 's okay for you to be twisted , but not me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , because you are my sweet , pure - xxunk little wife , ara . \\n▁ and i wo n't taint you the way i ' ve been tainted . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , sending my incredulous smile across the room , away from him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not as pure as you think i am . '' \\n▁ he cupped both my cheeks and kissed my lips once . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to die soon , ara . \\n▁ let me go peacefully to my death with the notion that my involvement in your life has n't ruined you , please . '' \\n▁ i laid both hands above my head , crossing my wrists like they were bound ; my body long and open to all he wanted from me . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you 'll just have to stick around until i ' m all sweet and innocent again then . '' \\n▁ he laughed and caged both my hands in one of his . \\n▁ ` ` you 're going to be sorry you did that . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you going to spank me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , smiling playfully . \\n▁ ` ` okay , but remember , you asked for it , '' he warned . \\n▁ ` ` i can take whatever you can dish out . '' \\n▁ he bit his lip , his fang making a deep impression in the skin , and reached down , leaving a gentle but sharp sting across the xxunk part of my thigh , almost on my bottom . \\n▁ i jumped a little , my leg tightening , but the rush of heat only tingled , making my skin want more . \\n▁ ` ` that did n't hurt . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not supposed to hurt , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` what 's it supposed to do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` open you up - take something from you that you would n't give to anyone else . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` control . \\n▁ permission to hurt you . '' \\n▁ he paused , letting the words simmer through me . \\n▁ ` ` the right to do whatever i want with the trust that i 'll draw the line before it gets too much . \\n▁ the feeling of opening up - experiencing something we normally run from - in a completely open , completely vulnerable situation . '' \\n▁ i thought about the emotions that little smack stirred in me , seeing myself tense and flinch as the pain flared , my soul suddenly connecting with him after the sting dissolved . \\n▁ ` ` you do realise you 're tainting me right now . '' \\n▁ he wet his lips and ran his thumb slowly up my chin , pulling my mouth apart . \\n▁ ` ` maybe that was always inevitable . '' \\n▁ ` ` as was the hurt , '' i said sadly . \\n▁ his hand rested over my breast , his fingers pressing firmly to feel my heart . \\n▁ ` ` i know you 're suffering , ara . \\n▁ but i will leave you with a child , at least . \\n▁ i promise . '' \\n▁ i nodded , placing my hand over his . \\n▁ ` ` then you better make love to me , david . \\n▁ i do n't want our child conceived while you 're spanking me . '' \\n▁ he laughed , falling on his elbows , his silky , naked body completely touching mine , and brought his hand up to sweep my sweaty hair off my brow . \\n▁ ` ` look at you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i said self - consciously . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve grown up so much , ara , but you 'll always be that sweet girl i fell in love with on the football field at school . '' \\n▁ i looked up at his perfect dark pink lips , then at the long lashes surrounding those emerald eyes , and i could still see so much of the boy he would always be to me - the sweet , funny , carefree guy i sometimes missed . \\n▁ but that was fading - washing away to reveal the man inside me right now . \\n▁ my king . \\n▁ my husband . \\n▁ strong . \\n▁ a fighter . \\n▁ a man willing to die , willing to do anything to see that i never went a day again in my life looking over my shoulder . \\n▁ and his face changed then , his body moving faster against mine , his eyes turning dark and black as he reached the point of no return , becoming the man who would one day be the father my daughter never knew . \\n▁ i held back my cries , the lusted breath of ecstasy , the tears and the rage , and just wrapped him up tight in my arms , feeling him release his life force into my body , spreading hope and light throughout . \\n▁ i did n't want to orgasm . \\n▁ i did n't want to feel the pleasure of the moment ; i just wanted to remember what it felt like to hold him this way - to love him with all my heart - no other distractions in the world . \\n▁ so i drove my fingers into his hair , his shoulder pressing my jaw with the closeness , his body so heavy i could n't breathe , and just held him tighter - the muscles in my arms flexed and rigid to keep him close . \\n▁ i 'd never let him pull away . \\n▁ he was everything to me , just as i was everything to him , and we held each other as this truth rained through our tired , sweaty bodies , relaxing us down through the scales of exhaustion , breath by breath . \\n▁ he rested his weight on top of me , his elbows propping him up , and stroked my hair behind my ear a few times , taking in all of me - taking in my smile , my eyes , my scent , my skin , the wetness , the heat , the breathlessness . \\n▁ we laid that way , david going soft inside me , connected and unwilling to part , wordless but speaking volumes in silence , until we both turned our heads and watched the glimmer of red sunlight kiss the horizon on the far side of the world . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * i felt the presence of the hunter behind me , his eagle eye anticipating my every move . \\n▁ but he could n't read my mind , thank goodness , which meant he could only guess what i was about to do . \\n▁ ever since that cursed day i fell off the lighthouse , mike had slowly and surely managed to get his own way again and have guards all over the manor . \\n▁ it was downright annoying . \\n▁ especially since the business i had to attend was not for falcon 's ears , nor was it for the four men standing guard between the windows on every corridor and on every door of the manor . \\n▁ they were sworn to absolute secrecy about any and all private business that occurred , but i still did n't trust them . \\n▁ my red summer dress , so fitting for such a devilish mission , reflected the morning light back against the white walls to my right , making them pink , and my shadow danced beside me , flickering and dipping , lengthening over arthur 's door then wrapping the corner to the stairwell before i reached it . \\n▁ i glanced back inconspicuously to check falcon 's shadow , then turned the corner and headed down the stairs , taking a very quick right on the second floor , my fast feet putting sudden and great distance between my guard and i. ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ he called quietly , careful not to disturb any manor guests . \\n▁ but he 'd never find me . \\n▁ i closed jason 's door so slowly that the only sound it made as it clipped gently into place had no more volume than the back being snapped fast on an earring . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ he tried again , his voice drifting toward the wrong end of the manor . \\n▁ he knew he 'd been given the slip , and i 'd been caught giving him the slip enough that knew i had very little time before he picked up my scent and followed me here . \\n▁ except , by the time he figured it out , i 'd be long gone , leaving him with nothing but the burning question on his mind as he 'd scratch his head , muttering , where the hell did she go ? \\n▁ before executing my ` houdini ' escape , though , i took a moment to look around the small space . \\n▁ unlike the other rooms in the manor , this was undersized by the plaster wall hiding the secret room beside it but , despite the lack of space , still overflowed with jason 's personality . \\n▁ it was set out much the same as arthur 's room : a redwood canopy bed to the left , swathed in rich auburn blankets and pillows ; a fireplace between two windows , except jase only had one window , and a long oak table across from the foot of the bed . \\n▁ but , unlike arthur 's room , jase 's was painted blue between the white panels on the walls , and instead of plants and books about plants , his shelves were stuffed to overflowing with novels and comic books . \\n▁ his baseball cap sat on the tall drawers between the window and his bed , a pile of books stacked on the floor beside it , almost as high as the ledge , clearly used as some kind of footstool while he sat there in the nook , reading , and a small cluster of clothes littered the blanket box . \\n▁ it was exactly as i 'd imagine it should be . \\n▁ i walked over to the oak table and spread the collection of papers aside to see what he 'd been doing . \\n▁ several cartoon sketches of dragons , and girls with big eyes and long , blue hair , stared back up at me . \\n▁ i knew he was talented , but most people i 'd met that could draw were good at either real - life or cartoon . \\n▁ not both . \\n▁ jase was clearly just too talented . \\n▁ i picked up a picture and ran my fingers over the lines of a dog 's face and the speech bubble above its head , moving my touch then to the cursive signature on the bottom right corner . \\n▁ i 'd never really paid much attention to his handwriting , but it did say a lot about him - each long , smooth stroke of the pen tip over the page that led to the tall then rounded lines of the j and the o , shorter , more decisive strokes on the a and the n , and the s almost non - existent . \\n▁ he never really owned his name . \\n▁ i knew that . \\n▁ it was a name given to him by his father because it was against the law not to name a child . \\n▁ david told me their father had flipped through the paper until he found the front page news about a cad named jason xxunk , a rat of a man that rained devastation on their town , selling high - interest loans to the already poor and destitute then taking their homes when they could n't pay . \\n▁ and jason saw this name as a role he 'd one day live up to : a sign , a signature , that illustrated everything impure and childish and dishonest about this xxunk of a boy . \\n▁ but all i saw was a strong warrior with a heart so big and so kind it allowed the innocence of boyhood to shine through , despite everything he 'd done or suffered . \\n▁ i would never believe he was the ` leftovers ' of centuries of evil being drained from one bloodline , not for as long as i 'd live . \\n▁ i placed the page back down and hugged myself . \\n▁ this room and everything in it held a certain amount of personality that jason did n't carry with him out in the real world , and it smelled like him , so rich with everything that made me love him , that i walked toward the secret door to eve 's room with a bit more of a brisk stride than i intended . \\n▁ if i could have avoided coming this way , i would have . \\n▁ but the secret passage from my room was off limits while david was in there , awake . \\n▁ he 'd hear it the second it opened , and i did n't have all day to wait for him to finish reading his book . \\n▁ once his mind was set on a few hours of relaxation , he would do exactly that . \\n▁ and , unfortunately for me , the secret room was the only way i could escape falcon . \\n▁ it was n't like i could just close my bedroom door , wander down the corridor to find morgaine and have a chat with her . \\n▁ falcon would overhear , then tell mike what i 'd said , and then it 'd all get back david , who 'd be mad at me for talking to morgaine in the first place , since he clearly had some underlying reason he did n't want me to . \\n▁ unfortunately for him , though , i was n't quite as naive and trusting as i had been a few weeks ago . \\n▁ i pushed the panel to eve 's room so the door popped open , then tiptoed inside , closing the portal behind me . \\n▁ the room was dark and undisturbed , still stale from the last conversation that was held in here . \\n▁ i could almost feel the tension and confusion lingering within the very air i was breathing . \\n▁ it seemed nothing in here was ever affected by time , not even memories . \\n▁ i shook it off and walked across the room to the bookshelf disguising a secret door that led down a stairwell and into a tunnel that would take me to the small lilithian village , lamia , on the other side of the island . \\n▁ from there , i 'd be able to speedily run back here and seek out morgaine - free from a certain giant mike - alike . \\n▁ sure , it was a great length to go to , but this was falcon i was running from - not quaid . \\n▁ it took great lengths just to stop him hearing me take a pee in the bathroom every day . \\n▁ dust gathered under my fingertips as i traced the spines of the old books , feeling for the loose one . \\n▁ when i pulled back on it , though , it shifted downward , but the secret door did n't open . \\n▁ i pulled again and again , finally giving up with a little groan . \\n▁ clearly , it would take greater lengths to escape falcon than i realised . \\n▁ the door was sealed in place , like it was unlatched or the connection had just disintegrated over time . \\n▁ ` ` damn it , '' i huffed , looking down at my summery dress . \\n▁ the only option left now was to jump from the window , and hope no one saw me do it . \\n▁ i quietly unhitched the wooden panel from the loose nail over the window and laid it to the ground , peering out through the glass . \\n▁ the coast was clear , but the distance from here to my clear coast was a pretty big drop . \\n▁ had i been better at math , i might have even been able to guess exactly how far it was , but it did n't matter . \\n▁ i had to jump because i just had to talk to morgaine . \\n▁ so , here i sat , butt on the window ledge , feet dangling over the second story drop , taking a mouthful of air to give me courage . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a vampire , ara . \\n▁ just jump , '' i told myself . \\n▁ myself did n't move . \\n▁ ` ` fine , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll throw you . '' \\n▁ and as i was about to slip easily off the ledge and drop to a graceful landing , the air wrapped my feet and legs and hands , and came out of my gob in a long scream . \\n▁ the ground rose up too fast - way too fast for me to calculate the angle of my feet against the speed of attack . \\n▁ i covered my eyes , readying myself for the impact , when a neck - twisting jolt sent shockwaves through my bones , a large pair of hands wrapping my ribs and falling under my knees before the ground smacked my xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` goddamn it , ara , '' falcon growled , placing me gently on the ground . \\n▁ ` ` where did you come from ? '' \\n▁ i gasped , pulling my dress down to cover my undies . \\n▁ ` ` never mind that . '' \\n▁ he stepped back and rubbed his head , cursing under his breath . \\n▁ ` ` you scared the living hell out of me . \\n▁ what were you thinking ? '' \\n▁ i looked up at the window , and the wavering ghost of eve smiled down at me , covering her mouth . \\n▁ ` ` i … i was trying to escape you . '' \\n▁ ` ` you should know better than that by now , ara . '' \\n▁ he straightened up , rolling his shoulders back . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , your majesty . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't need to rush in all white - xxunk and save me . \\n▁ i would have been okay if i 'd hit the ground , falcon . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ and if i 'd given you about two more seconds , you would have corrected the fall , but i was n't willing to risk it . '' \\n▁ he rubbed his hand firmly across his heart . \\n▁ ` ` no offence , but if you 're gon na turn yourself into royal stew , do it on someone else 's watch . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ it 's just - '' ` ` just ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think someone pushed me . '' \\n▁ he looked up at the window , taking a quick step forward . \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ eve pressed her finger to her lip . \\n▁ ` ` no one . '' \\n▁ i looked back at falcon . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m stupid . \\n▁ i just fell , is all . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , '' he said , issuing me one raised brow . \\n▁ ` ` i follow you for eight hours every day of your life . \\n▁ you 're not stupid . \\n▁ and you did n't fall . \\n▁ so do n't try to play dumb with me . \\n▁ who pushed you ? '' \\n▁ i bit my lip . \\n▁ he 'd never believe me . \\n▁ ` ` eve ? '' \\n▁ he suggested . \\n▁ my mouth fell open below wide eyes , and when my head whipped up to the second floor window , eve was gone . \\n▁ ` ` you saw her ? '' \\n▁ his gaze slowly came back down to mine . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` then how did you … '' ` ` i ' ve seen you talking to thin air - heard you say her name . '' \\n▁ and a sudden rush of panic flooded me . \\n▁ ` ` falcon , you ca n't say anything to da - '' ` ` i wo n't . '' \\n▁ he held up his hand , stopping me right there . \\n▁ ` ` everything you do , say , or see , is privileged information , majesty . '' \\n▁ ` ` but not to mike . \\n▁ he 's - '' ` ` he 's not the one i report to . '' \\n▁ ` ` then … '' i stood a little taller . \\n▁ ` ` who is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` me . '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m acting head of queen 's guard . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he nodded once . \\n▁ ` ` they report to me now . '' \\n▁ i could n't believe my ears . \\n▁ ` ` why did mike put you in charge ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because he has other things to do - more important than worrying about what you 're doing . \\n▁ he has an entire knight 's core to run . '' \\n▁ ` ` whoa . '' \\n▁ i placed my hand on my brow , blowing a puff of air out through one corner of my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` that is messing with my head . '' \\n▁ falcon laughed . \\n▁ ` ` well , it 's how things are now . \\n▁ and if you ever - '' he held one finger up in emphasis , '' - attempt an escape like that again , i will quit my job and put mike back in charge . \\n▁ got it ? '' \\n▁ i saluted . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sir . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ now . '' \\n▁ he grabbed me very gently by the arm and led me into the shadows closer to the manor . \\n▁ ` ` where were you going , and why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't tell you . '' \\n▁ ` ` actually , you can . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i ca n't . '' \\n▁ he took a deep breath and let it out slowly . \\n▁ it amazed me how much he was like mike , with his sandy blond hair , his bulky frame , his warm eyes that were quite smiley when he was n't looking at me , and the sternness that afforded him command of the room without solicitation . \\n▁ ` ` can you give me a chance ? '' \\n▁ he said . \\n▁ ` ` a chance ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ a chance , ara . '' \\n▁ he stepped closer to make his point . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m a member of your personal council . \\n▁ i ' m your bodyguard and the one man responsible for your overall safety . \\n▁ i ' m trusted by both your husband and , more importantly , your overly - protective best friend . '' \\n▁ we both chuckled softly . \\n▁ ` ` if mike can trust me , maybe you can give me a chance , ara . \\n▁ because in order for me to keep you safe , i need to be sure you wo n't try to run off on me when you have something you want to do but do n't think i 'll approve of . \\n▁ so … '' he took another long breath . \\n▁ ` ` let me earn your trust . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's a matter of security , falcon , to do with information i ' ve learned - from david , '' i added so he did n't think i was being easily led . \\n▁ ` ` and he asked me not to let anyone know , not even the council . '' \\n▁ falcon nodded , taking a step back . \\n▁ ` ` i respect that . '' \\n▁ ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ i said , waiting for the ` but . ' \\n▁ ` ` no buts . '' \\n▁ he raised both hands . \\n▁ ` ` if you have good reason not to tell me , then just tell me that , ara . \\n▁ just tell me you need to take care of some business , and i 'll back off for an hour or so . \\n▁ okay ? '' \\n▁ my face went blank . \\n▁ i could feel it . \\n▁ ` ` are you being serious right now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m running the show here , ara . '' \\n▁ he presented the proverbial show . \\n▁ ` ` mike might not have trusted you before , but i trust you . \\n▁ i think you 're a very smart girl , and i think you have grown up monumentally in the last two months , and if you say you need privacy for a bit , then i respect that . '' \\n▁ i just wanted to hug him . \\n▁ i nodded once instead , reminding myself that knights are not friends . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , falcon . '' \\n▁ he bowed his head , placing both hands behind his back . \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome . '' \\n▁ i left falcon in the garden and followed ` last sighting ' reports from bystanders until i found my wrath - recipient wandering down an empty corridor in the servant quarters . \\n▁ there was no one around at this time of day so , despite the sub - level of the manor not exactly being a cone of silence , it seemed like as good a place as any to bark my fury on the unsuspecting target . \\n▁ ` ` morgaine ! '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` you lied to me . '' \\n▁ she watched me walk toward her , growing slightly taller . \\n▁ ` ` i did ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the immortal damned - the prophecy , which is really a contract . \\n▁ and worse , your lies , david 's lies - all of them have gone so deep you ' ve had to convince the entire lilithian public of the same . '' \\n▁ i stopped in front of her , closing the door beside me to block out the white light spilling into the hall . \\n▁ ` ` what are you hiding ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not hiding anything , majesty , and neither is david . '' \\n▁ i bit my teeth together . \\n▁ i knew my face was as stone and hard as the statue of lilith in the fountain outside , but so was my resolve . \\n▁ she was damn well going to at least confess , or this stone face would be last thing she saw . \\n▁ ` ` okay , so i made up a prophecy - '' ` ` that 's a pretty big deal , morgaine . \\n▁ that 's a pretty frickin ' huge lie to carry all these centuries . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , but … '' she made a small gap between her fingers , her neck shrinking into her shoulders a little . \\n▁ ` ` it was just a teensy stretch of the truth . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes , dropping my folded arms . \\n▁ ` ` knowing the conditions in which the lie about the prophecy was forged , morgaine , i can forgive that . \\n▁ i mean , really , i ' m not surprised . \\n▁ none of the prophecy crap ever made sense anyway , but … '' i angled my head to one side , my open palms rolling outward with my shrug . \\n▁ ` ` you lied to me about the damned , and maintained that lie all this time . '' \\n▁ ` ` i got scared , amara . '' \\n▁ she brushed her hand down my arm . \\n▁ i jerked away . \\n▁ ` ` our people have been suffering for centuries . \\n▁ they were locked away , tortured , forced to torture other vampires at drake 's will . \\n▁ and it was unnatural . \\n▁ we could n't live that way any longer . \\n▁ then , after jason hurt you , i thought you wanted to die . \\n▁ i thought you were going to commit suicide , and i just could n't think . \\n▁ i told you there was a way to help the damned before i even realised what i 'd said . \\n▁ and you did n't even look up at me until i said you could free them . \\n▁ after that , i had to do some pretty darn fast thinking to reshape that lie . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , only you and david know the truth about the damned - that i ca n't , and my child ca n't , fix them ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ you ' ve not been made a fool of , ara . \\n▁ it took some work , but i convinced emily and mike , too . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what about arthur ? \\n▁ did you convince him , too ? \\n▁ because he just went right on along with it - even told me he wanted to be free ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he was n't lying , amara . \\n▁ he wanted freedom . \\n▁ but not from immortality . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , from what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` from his bind to drake - an eternal bind . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i mean … he wanted you to use your venom to kill him once all this was over . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he wants peace : death . \\n▁ he wanted a family , a wife , a normal life , but he will never have that . \\n▁ joining our fight was his way of setting things right - his penance to god for all the wrong he 's done , you might say . \\n▁ once the humans and the xxunk are safe , amara , he … '' she looked down at her feet , shaking her head . \\n▁ i slowly rolled my chin to my chest . \\n▁ ` ` and when were you going to tell me this ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was n't . \\n▁ and neither was he . '' \\n▁ ` ` but he promised he 'd stay . \\n▁ he - '' ` ` and he will keep that promise to you now , my queen . '' \\n▁ she rushed in and touched my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not going anywhere . \\n▁ you gave him new reason to live . '' \\n▁ ` ` me ? \\n▁ how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he loves you , amara , like the daughter he never had . \\n▁ and he has everything he ever wanted : his nephews are safe and well , away from the plague of drake 's darkness . \\n▁ he has the lab he always begged for . '' \\n▁ she smiled fondly , hugging herself . \\n▁ ` ` and he has a precious little girl to worry and fuss over . '' \\n▁ i smirked . \\n▁ ` ` precious ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you must know he holds you in high regard , amara . \\n▁ you 're more precious to him than even his nephews , i believe . '' \\n▁ ` ` i doubt that , morg . \\n▁ but … are you sure ? \\n▁ i mean , are you sure he does n't still want to di - '' ` ` i ' m sure . '' \\n▁ she nodded once . \\n▁ ` ` he swore to david in his own blood that he 'd stay here and care for you after david 's gone . '' \\n▁ ` ` if he wants to protect me so bad , maybe he should kill drake himself . '' \\n▁ she took a deep breath and let it out slowly . \\n▁ ` ` this whole thing 's a mess , is n't it ? '' \\n▁ i covered my head with my hands for a second . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` is there anything i can do to set things right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it would help if everyone in my council sat down in a room and unveiled all the truths they ' ve been hiding , you know , a massive heart - to - heart type of thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` if it would serve the queen well , perhaps you should arrange this . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , right . \\n▁ i ' m sure everyone will participate equally . '' \\n▁ morgaine moved one shoulder up slowly . \\n▁ ` ` you never know who might surprise you as the one who reveals the most secrets , amara . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n▁ she eyed me critically . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ anyway , there was something else you wanted to ask me , was n't there ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ how did you - ? '' \\n▁ ` ` my ability to understand another person goes a little deeper than pure empathy , my queen . \\n▁ what did you want to know ? '' \\n▁ my arms fell heavily to my sides with the breath i exhaled . \\n▁ ` ` what do you know about lilith 's children ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um . '' \\n▁ she frowned . \\n▁ ` ` not much . \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` morgana . '' \\n▁ ` ` what about her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david found some more information on her - '' ` ` where ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in the scroll room . '' \\n▁ ` ` where in there ? '' \\n▁ she took one step in that direction . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been right through there . \\n▁ i never found anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` did n't know you were looking . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course i was . \\n▁ i ' m trying to piece this together as much as you are . \\n▁ so - '' she rolled her hand at the wrist , prompting me . \\n▁ ` ` what did he find ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she was a half - blood witch . \\n▁ we think drake may have her - if she lived . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would drake have her ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` well , where is she ? \\n▁ where did she go ? \\n▁ if she simply died , there 'd be more information on her . \\n▁ someone has gone to great lengths to ensure no one ever asked questions about her . '' \\n▁ morgaine nodded thoughtfully . \\n▁ ` ` true . \\n▁ but , why would drake have her ? \\n▁ maybe she 's alive , living out there somewhere . '' \\n▁ ` ` because drake killed anyone who had any allegiance to lilith , but morgana was probably very powerful , maybe served a purpose . \\n▁ or maybe he 's just kept her to torture her all these years for being the blood of lilith . '' \\n▁ ` ` torturing her ? '' \\n▁ morgaine nearly rocketed forward , then sobered herself , straightening her shirt . \\n▁ ` ` he would n't do that . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? \\n▁ he did it to me , and he ordered his own son 's death . '' \\n▁ ` ` what son ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the boy , the blond one i killed at the castle . '' \\n▁ she frowned , her eyes drifting down the hall . \\n▁ ` ` that was n't his son . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , it was . \\n▁ arthur told me - '' ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ she nodded , smiling to herself . \\n▁ ` ` arthur told you . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` why did he tell you that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ we were just talking and - '' ` ` oh . \\n▁ i see . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he wanted you to feel better about that , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ he was telling me about drake 's incestuous behaviour and the monsters he created from it , and - '' ` ` okay . \\n▁ first of all - '' she laughed , holding her index finger up . \\n▁ ` ` drake was not incestuous . '' \\n▁ ` ` he was n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ he had a child with a woman who was his great granddaughter by blood , but he did n't know that at the time . '' \\n▁ ` ` and … that was that the boy i killed ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ you killed simon . '' \\n▁ ` ` who was he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he was vile , but he was n't drake 's creation . \\n▁ okay , maybe he was , but not his son . '' \\n▁ ` ` how was he drake 's creation ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake adopted simon when he was a small boy . \\n▁ he 'd been living in the slums of streets infested with disease and plague for months on his own , feeding off rats and all sorts . \\n▁ when drake found him , he 'd been exposed to some horrific situations , including brutal rape by passing travellers . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` the child was a mess , '' she continued . \\n▁ ` ` drake taught him to be a vampire from a young age - taught him to kill , to transfer his rage onto those who would become his next meal . \\n▁ but , on simon 's twentieth birthday , when drake turned him , the heightened vampiric emotions took anything sweet and human we once saw in him and burned it . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , he created a monster ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and drake had grown to love simon too much to lock him away , but the boy just could n't be controlled . \\n▁ that is the only reason he was killed . \\n▁ drake is not that cruel , and he would not have kidnapped morgana , if she even existed . '' \\n▁ ` ` what makes you so sure ? \\n▁ and why the sudden change in opinion about drake ? '' \\n▁ she exhaled through her nose , her jaw stiff , hands tight by her sides . \\n▁ ` ` well , it 's actually not sudden . '' \\n▁ ` ` uh , yes , it is . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i ' ve just … '' she loosened her fists . \\n▁ ` ` i just keep my opinions to myself if they oppose that of the greater mass . '' \\n▁ my mouth fell open in disgust . \\n▁ ` ` do n't judge me . '' \\n▁ she pointed in my face . \\n▁ ` ` it 's how i ' ve survive in a world of vampires that hate my kind . '' \\n▁ i pushed her hand down . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ but i did n't realise you were pro - drake . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey ! \\n▁ i so am not . '' \\n▁ her tone softened then . \\n▁ ` ` but he 's not as bad as everyone says , either . '' \\n▁ i folded my arms and leaned on the wall . \\n▁ ` ` that 's what i ' m always saying . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ she smiled and patted my arm . \\n▁ ` ` but you just have n't learned yet that sometimes your opinion is the least important part of ruling a nation . '' \\n▁ ` ` then what 's the most important , smarty pants ? '' \\n▁ ` ` playing the game , '' she said , and folded her arms slowly , adopting my coy grin . \\n▁ ` ` agree to be agreeable until the masses agree with the opinion you 're keeping to yourself . \\n▁ if you 're right , that eventually becomes evident . \\n▁ you do n't need to kick and scream to make people see your side , amara . \\n▁ only time can really do that . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you think drake is agreeable ? '' \\n▁ she leaned on the wall beside me , propping her foot up under her thigh . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , i have to kick and scream , morg , to make my voice heard here . \\n▁ if we can reason with drake , then david does n't need to go to his death . '' \\n▁ ` ` so go tell him that . '' \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake . '' \\n▁ she whipped her phone out of her pocket and held it out to me . \\n▁ ` ` call him up . \\n▁ ask him if he wants to negotiate . '' \\n▁ i laughed , pushing the phone away . \\n▁ ` ` very funny . '' \\n▁ she placed it back in her pocket . \\n▁ ` ` david 's going to elysium to free the prisoners tomorrow , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 'll be freeing pepper ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` and he 'll be back next week ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` this time , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this time , he 'll be back , but one day he 'll go on the next mission , and he wo n't return , amara . '' \\n▁ she took a step toward mike as he appeared down the other end of the hall . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't joking about calling drake . \\n▁ i think you should consider it . '' \\n▁ ` ` maybe i 'll think about it , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ then i 'll text you his number . '' \\n▁ she turned and walked backward for a second , her arms folded . \\n▁ ` ` because i do n't want david to die either . '' \\n▁ i watched her walk away , wondering which part of her recommended the call to drake : the betraying traitor we suspected she was a few weeks ago , or a true friend who wanted to help me stay on the throne . \\n▁ either way , we shared one common belief : killing drake was not the best option , even if he wanted to insert an evil witch 's black soul into my not - yet - conceived child . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * midday sun streamed down through the glass dome above me , casting coloured light across my forearm and david 's chest . \\n▁ i frayed the tips of my fingers through the reds and blues , turning my hand to angle the colours into my palm . \\n▁ the world could just feel so simple at times , but not more than it did when i was in david 's arms this way . \\n▁ somewhere outside , though , down the long , winding road leading to the manor , a car was edging closer , all fuelled up and ready to take my husband away for the week , turning this precious moment into one of our last . \\n▁ i traced a circle around the hollow between david 's collarbones , feeling for a pulse i knew i 'd never find . \\n▁ i 'd hoped that one day jason and i would figure out the key to reversing vampirism and that maybe i 'd know what it was like to hear david 's heart beat under my ear , but the truth of that wish occurred to me only then : even if those power were still possible , david would be long dead before i figured them out . \\n▁ my heart sunk , its roots reaching out for something to hold onto inside me . \\n▁ but without hope to find them , they were left floating around like unbound tendrils , lost . \\n▁ i did feel some relief , though , finally knowing the truth about all this prophecy stuff , and it was much easier being around david with no secrets between us . \\n▁ i could breathe for once , and just exist with him ; no longer afraid he 'd read my thoughts and find out i knew more than he wanted me to . \\n▁ however , i did still wonder how he learned about his bloodline being cleansed . \\n▁ if arthur knew , was it something david had always known , too , and was it even true that he and lilith were meant for each other , or was it just another unfounded theory ? \\n▁ ` ` how do you feel about the prophecy now ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` i … good , i guess . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , it 's tricky , because i nearly slipped up and said something to xxunk and walt the other day . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what did you nearly say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , i nearly said that it was a relief not be tangled up in some prophecy i did n't want a part of . '' \\n▁ david laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i corrected myself , though , '' i added . \\n▁ ` ` and said i was relieved that we were finally seeing to the prisoners at elysium . '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ ` ` but i accidentally called it la chateau de la mort . '' \\n▁ he laughed again , propping his arm behind his head . \\n▁ ` ` was arthur around ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ thank god . '' \\n▁ ` ` speaking of arthur . '' \\n▁ he lifted my top a little , rolling up to look down . \\n▁ ` ` that rash you woke up with after you fell from the lighthouse is still there . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i cupped his hand , stopping him from touching it . \\n▁ ` ` is it sore ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ just itchy . \\n▁ like i can feel something crawling out through my skin . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i want you to go see my uncle and get something for it . \\n▁ it looks as though it 's turning black . '' \\n▁ i cringed . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ i 'll go see him once you 're gone this afternoon . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he drew his arm from under his head and checked his watch , then tucked it back again . \\n▁ ` ` then call me right away and tell me what he says . '' \\n▁ ` ` wo n't you be out of service at elysium ? '' \\n▁ ` ` only in the tunnels . '' \\n▁ ` ` you mean dungeons . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he nuzzled my head for a second . \\n▁ ` ` dungeons . '' \\n▁ ` ` will … when you free … '' i swallowed my heart back down from my throat . \\n▁ ` ` when you free her , will she … ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , pepper and i are done . '' \\n▁ ` ` but she does n't know that . \\n▁ she does n't know you dumped her and fell in love with - '' ` ` ara , enough . '' \\n▁ he slid out from under me and hooked his legs over the side of the bed . \\n▁ ` ` this is hard enough as it is , without you adding your concerns . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i - '' he stood up as . \\n▁ ` ` pepper is a part of my past . \\n▁ were it not for the fact that she is one of the prisoners granted pardon , i 'd not have any contact with her . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she broke the law . '' \\n▁ ` ` so she 's nothing to you now ? '' \\n▁ he turned away . \\n▁ ` ` it 's just how i feel . '' \\n▁ ` ` harsh . '' \\n▁ i crawled across the bed and hopped out , coming to stand next to david . \\n▁ ` ` would you hate me if i did something illegal ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just … do n't . '' \\n▁ i half laughed . \\n▁ ` ` why are you so serious when it comes to the law ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's just the way i am , ara . '' \\n▁ he walked to the blanket box and zipped up the duffel bag there . \\n▁ ` ` it 's the way i ' ve always been . \\n▁ you know that . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i stopped behind him , searching the set of his shoulders for an answer i was n't sure i wanted . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you - '' carefully and cautiously , i reached across and touched his back . \\n▁ ` ` you are only going to elysium , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why do you ask ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just … you 're not sneaking off to kill drake , are you ? '' \\n▁ he turned with a smile and reached up to tuck a lock of hair behind my ear . \\n▁ ` ` i will return to you this time , mon amour . \\n▁ you have my word . '' \\n▁ chapter six no one could imagine from looking up at the beige wall around the garden of lilith that a menagerie of life thrived behind it . \\n▁ yellow beams of summer light reached down through the pink leaves of oddly shaped trees , turning the shrubs along the path purple , like a canvas of endless colours to distract my lonely thoughts . \\n▁ i balanced my toes over the cobblestones , avoiding the cool , slippery moss growing between each one , and made my way slowly to the water fountain at the centre of the garden . \\n▁ tiny dots of water rose from the stone statue to catch a ride on the breeze , greeting my cheeks with cool kisses before sweeping out of the garden and far away . \\n▁ i wiped my face with the back of my wrist and took a seat on the grey ledge , laying my book down beside me . \\n▁ there was something magical and peaceful about this place but , for some reason , despite no one being allowed here without invitation from the queen , i never really felt alone - never really felt like this was my garden . \\n▁ beside me , a small splash caught my attention . \\n▁ i dipped my fingers into the pond , sending a school of orange fish scattering under lily pads , making them ripple as if they were breathing . \\n▁ but i did n't care if the fish ran away . \\n▁ i did n't even what their company today . \\n▁ i just did n't really want to see anyone . \\n▁ did n't want anyone else to ask me how i was feeling now that david was gone , then look away , disinterested , when i said i felt like crying . \\n▁ the only answer anyone wanted was , ` ` i ' m doing well . '' \\n▁ i got so sick of saying it ; so sick of everyone ignoring the lie they heard in my tone , that ` alone ' had become the only place i could stand to be . \\n▁ i 'd come out here to the garden in search of the gentle breeze that moved the leaves in a summer song , xxunk with the deep hum of frogs croaking . \\n▁ but as my thoughts stopped for a second so i could listen to that peaceful sound , my ears pricked . \\n▁ i heard nothing . \\n▁ no insects scuffling about . \\n▁ no frogs calling for a mate . \\n▁ no birds chattering and bickering over worms . \\n▁ and my skin crawled with the very distinct feeling that i was being watched . \\n▁ i stood slowly and turned around , searching every shadow or flicker of movement . \\n▁ ` ` eve ? \\n▁ is that you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ a tall silhouette appeared in the glare of sunlight . \\n▁ i shielded my face , turning to run when it grabbed my arm . \\n▁ ` ` ara . \\n▁ ara , '' he said more gently , pulling me in , wrapping his arms all the way around my head and shoulders . \\n▁ i pushed out from the firmness of his chest , catching the scent of orange chocolate . \\n▁ and all the fight in me stopped , my lips falling softly part , hands to my sides as i took two slow steps backward . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m dreaming , '' i stated . \\n▁ he smiled down at me , his green eyes warmer than they 'd been since i could n't remember when . \\n▁ ` ` no , my love . \\n▁ you 're not . '' \\n▁ and that was it . \\n▁ my lip quivered , my chest went tight , and a full - scale melt down started off for the finish line . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing back ? '' \\n▁ i wailed . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve only been gone for one night . '' \\n▁ he cupped a hand to the back of my neck and drew me to him again . \\n▁ ` ` i got all the way out to elysium , unpacked my bags in my old room and , when quaid brought me the prisoner manifest , i suddenly realised i did n't care . '' \\n▁ my face rolled up to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i mean … '' he sighed impatiently , but not like he was irritated with me , more himself . \\n▁ ` ` why would i be hundreds of miles across the country , releasing vampires i do n't believe deserve it , when i have such little time left in the one place in this world i actually want to be ? '' \\n▁ i brushed my hair from my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` with … do you mean here ? \\n▁ being king ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he laughed , scooping the last strand of hair away from my lip . \\n▁ ` ` silly girl . \\n▁ with you . '' \\n▁ my mouth opened but nothing came out . \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' he said , dropping his hands from my face to take a seat on the fountain 's ledge . \\n▁ ` ` the fact that you 're surprised by that breaks my heart , ara , and proves to me that the man i thought i was is not the king that stands , well , sits before you now . '' \\n▁ i sat down next to him , watching our shadows on the ground blend and meet as one . \\n▁ ` ` you have been a bit … '' ` ` mean , '' he said in short . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been a king but not a husband . \\n▁ a lawyer and judge , but not a man . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , '' i said softly , sweeping his hand into mine , and he actually turned in his seat so he could look at me . \\n▁ ` ` i understand , you know . \\n▁ i get it . \\n▁ i do . \\n▁ you ' ve not only had to deal with the painful burden of going to your death , but you 're also coming to terms with the fact that you 'll be leaving me alone . \\n▁ which is hard for you , i know , because i also know you do n't want me to be sad , but you 're duty bound to do it anyway . '' \\n▁ his eyes drifted to our locked hands , a gentle smile holding back the pain i could see in them . \\n▁ ` ` you know me well . \\n▁ but it does n't excuse - '' ` ` no , but i know something else about you , david , and i ' m not sure even you ' ve realised this is a factor in your moods . '' \\n▁ i exhaled through my nose , trying to word what was buzzing around in my brain . \\n▁ ` ` royalty is important to you . \\n▁ and you 're a good king . \\n▁ but you 'll only be king for a short time . \\n▁ i know you want to make sure that , in your short reign , people remember you as one of the great ones . \\n▁ i understand that about you . '' \\n▁ i patted his hand . \\n▁ ` ` i understand that you ' ve been battling with these two parts of yourself , and it 's hard to be a good king and a kind husband . \\n▁ i could n't do half the things you do , david , and i respect you for that . \\n▁ and i know , at the end of the day , you still love me as much as the moment you met me . \\n▁ so i ' m okay with your nasty side from time to time . \\n▁ and if you were n't going to die in a few months , i know that , eventually , you 'd have found a balance between being a king and a loving husband , but we do n't have that time . '' \\n▁ i cupped his hand and squeezed it until he looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` so , i understand , and i do n't want you to feel guilty about anything . '' \\n▁ the muscles in his jaw tightened , but as he opened his mouth to speak , he let the control slip for a second and i saw his chin quiver , saw the coating of tears in his eyes , so thick they had n't spilled . \\n▁ ` ` aw , david . '' \\n▁ i reached up and swiped under his lashes , releasing them . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ he tucked me into his chest , his tears falling against my hair . \\n▁ but i did n't mind . \\n▁ ` ` my love . \\n▁ i - '' his body shook for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to leave you . \\n▁ i love you more than i thought it was possible to love a person . \\n▁ and i know the pain you suffer right now . \\n▁ i know you ' ve kept that pain from me to save my heart from aching , but i - '' he swallowed hard , sniffing back the liquid . \\n▁ ` ` how am i gon na leave you ? \\n▁ i … if it would take surgery to cut you out of my heart , what must that mean for the way you love me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david , i - '' ` ` i hurt you . \\n▁ i … all i ' ve done is yell at you , undermine you , overrule you and dominate you . \\n▁ i ' ve no right to treat you that way , and i ' m , '' he paused and kissed my head , ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ i snuggled into his chest again , wrapping both arms all the way around his slightly bony ribs . \\n▁ ` ` i forgive you , david . \\n▁ like i said , i understand why you ' ve been that way . \\n▁ i mean , you have n't really been my david , which means you 're clearly under a lot of stress . \\n▁ it would be unnatural not to be . '' \\n▁ he laughed a little , cupping the back of my head again . \\n▁ ` ` and this is why i snuck away for a bit . \\n▁ i can free the prisoners in a few days . \\n▁ but , right now , i just want more time with you . '' \\n▁ i hugged him tighter . \\n▁ ` ` me too , david . \\n▁ i … we only have a month until you go to kill drake , and - '' ` ` i ' m rethinking that timeframe , ara , '' he cut in . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i sat back to look up at him . \\n▁ ` ` we need more time . '' \\n▁ he touched my face . \\n▁ ` ` we have n't even conceived yet , and that aside … i ' ve avoided being around you , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` to be honest , my love , i ' ve tried my hardest not to even look at you , touch you - anything that would make it hurt more the day i have to leave you . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , that - '' ` ` i know . \\n▁ it 's mean and stupid . \\n▁ i … '' he wiped a hand down his face , drying the tears away . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't aware i was doing it . \\n▁ it was n't until i got on the road , played a few cds - '' he looked down at me then , his eyes changing . \\n▁ ` ` do you know how long it 's been since i ' ve listened to music ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure i have since before our wedding . '' \\n▁ i pouted kind of mockingly . \\n▁ ` ` and as soon as i let my mind go for a second and just hear the notes , the music , my heart broke . \\n▁ i went back through all the horrible things i ' ve done or said these last few weeks , and i told myself to shut up , that you understood . \\n▁ repeated this to myself all the way to elysium , but it did n't matter . \\n▁ my heart was n't listening to my brain , ara , and i just had to come back . '' \\n▁ he brushed his curled fingers down the side of my face . \\n▁ ` ` i could n't leave for a week without making sure you knew exactly how much you mean to me . '' \\n▁ the birds and frogs had started singing again all around us , almost too noisy , like they were happy to see david again , but they were the only sounds . \\n▁ i just did n't know what to say , and at the same time , his words did n't surprise me . \\n▁ what surprised me was seeing the boy i fell in love with sitting right here in my garden , when i never thought he 'd surface again . \\n▁ ` ` i thought royalty had killed this david , like maybe the coronation had changed you . '' \\n▁ ` ` it did , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ he tucked my hair behind my ear . \\n▁ ` ` it changed me in the wrong ways . \\n▁ and i will still be a firm king , but not at the cost of your heart . '' \\n▁ i cupped his hand and held it to my face . \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ because you are one of the great kings , david . \\n▁ and i do n't want anything about that to change . '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing , huh ? '' \\n▁ his tone rose up a few octaves . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ i feel safer with you on the throne . \\n▁ and i know i can rule my people well when you 're gone , but … '' i smiled up at him . \\n▁ ` ` you 're leaving me with a pretty good example to follow . '' \\n▁ his broken , sad face cracked , and he smiled then . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't know how happy i am to hear you say that . '' \\n▁ ` ` i dunno , '' i said , hugging him again . \\n▁ ` ` i think your smile pretty much says it all . '' \\n▁ he laughed into my hair , wrapping his other arm around my ribs and linking them together there , holding me tight in this secret garden where nobody else was permitted to go . \\n▁ not even the king . \\n▁ when the sun rose , i opened my eyes and lay dreading the day . \\n▁ that is until i smelled the sweet scent of citrus and cologne beside me . \\n▁ each spicy breath filled me with renewed hope while every word we spoke in my garden yesterday echoed in my thoughts , elevating that hope to real possibility . \\n▁ david had not only said he was rethinking the time frame for his death , but had also gone and given the dagger back to arthur for safekeeping . \\n▁ he did n't tell me this , of course , but my reliable uncle - in - law had . \\n▁ and that made me suddenly eager to begin my day - another day i was blessed to have david beside me . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ he grabbed my hand as i flopped my legs over the side of the bed . \\n▁ ` ` it 's breakfast time , '' i said simply . \\n▁ ` ` we have to get dressed . '' \\n▁ he tugged my wrist , and i tumbled back down into the spoon . \\n▁ ` ` forget breakfast . \\n▁ we can be monarchs tomorrow . '' \\n▁ ` ` i thought we had to appear at all social gatherings , that our presence was a show of strength and governance ? '' \\n▁ he snuggled his nose into the curve of my neck , wrapping both arms all the way around my waist . \\n▁ ` ` you 're absolutely right . \\n▁ and you 'll have centuries to prove that after i ' m gone . '' \\n▁ i relaxed a little , stopped trying to get up , and just lay there all snug and cosy in his arms . \\n▁ ` ` i like this version of you much better . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ enjoy it now then , because this me has to go back to his kingly duties this afternoon . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i rolled over so i faced him . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a new case coming in to court today . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you do n't think i can handle it ? '' \\n▁ he ran the tip of his nose down mine . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not that , sweetheart . \\n▁ it 's that i do n't want you to handle it . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it 's a member from eric 's band . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i sat up . \\n▁ ` ` hey . '' \\n▁ david looked at the empty hollow of his arms , then at my face , then at his arms again . \\n▁ i lay back down , and the hold he had before tightened . \\n▁ ` ` what did he do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he revealed his vampirism to a human girl , and eric was forced to kill her . '' \\n▁ i bit my lip . \\n▁ ` ` is eric in trouble for that ? \\n▁ will he be brought before us t - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` then why ca n't i sentence his friend ? \\n▁ i would ' ve been the one to do it if you were n't here . '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' the cool breath he huffed moved my hair . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ you 're right . \\n▁ i ca n't rush in and play daddy all the time , '' he reasoned , more with himself than me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a big girl . \\n▁ if you want to handle this on your own , that 's fine with me . '' \\n▁ i leaned back a little to see if he was being sarcastic , but the corner of his lip angled up on one side with a sweet smile , and he closed his eyes again , taking a deeper breath of my scent . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not kidding , are you ? '' \\n▁ i asked , just to confirm . \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` about letting me handle it . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you think i was ? '' \\n▁ ` ` uh , yeah . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ he slid both hands along the sides of my face and planted a very soft , very sweetly - david kiss to my lips . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not easy for me to sit back and watch you be independent . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ i ' ve always been independent . '' \\n▁ ` ` not really , sweetheart . \\n▁ i mean , when we met , you needed me . \\n▁ you … you needed me to care for you , guide you . \\n▁ love you . \\n▁ and i guess i got used to that . \\n▁ it became a habit to baby you - '' ` ` like mike did . '' \\n▁ i smiled . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i can see how that relationship evolved that way . '' \\n▁ ` ` how so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's because you back down . \\n▁ if i put my foot down about something , you very rarely challenge me anymore . \\n▁ you never even question me , and sometimes i just do n't realise i ' m being a. . . '' \\n▁ ` ` moron ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ a controlling ass * * le . '' \\n▁ i sucked back the burst of laughter , accidentally spitting it out in david 's face . \\n▁ he wiped away the dots of my hilarity and skidded closer , wrapping his ankle around mine , our bare skin touching in every way possible . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to be that guy with you , ara . \\n▁ i do n't want to hurt you like that , and i do , you know i do , want you to be this wonderful , independent , smart , switched - on girl you are . \\n▁ i think i just suck at being a husband . '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't suck , david . '' \\n▁ i touched his face softly . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , okay . \\n▁ and the fact that you 're willing to acknowledge your own bad behaviour shows me that you 're a better husband than i could have hoped for . '' \\n▁ he kissed my lips again . \\n▁ ` ` that means a lot to me . '' \\n▁ i cuddled in to him again . \\n▁ ` ` let 's just start fresh , okay . \\n▁ i mean , neither of us has had a chance to be the other 's spouse because this is the first time we ' ve really been together since we were married . \\n▁ think about it , '' i reasoned , ` ` we had torture , possible eternal separation , followed by months apart , learning to rule a monarchy and , now , we have your imminent death on the horizon , and all of this is before we ' ve even had our first anniversary . '' \\n▁ he laughed once , completely wrapped up in what i was saying . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd say , '' i continued , ` ` the fact that we still love each other , that we can forgive each other 's xxunk and mistakes , means that we 're doing pretty well as a first - year married couple . '' \\n▁ the bend of his arm wrapped the back of my head , and he pulled me in under his jaw , holding me so tight i held my breath . \\n▁ ` ` there 's that wisdom i saw in you all those years ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` all those years ago , huh ? '' \\n▁ i raised a brow , even though he could n't see it . \\n▁ ` ` how old have we become in the last two years ? '' \\n▁ ` ` speaking for myself , '' he said with a chuckle . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve aged rather rapidly since i met you . '' \\n▁ ` ` hmpf . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` but what i meant was that you ' ve always been very wise , that i knew it from the first moment i heard your thoughts . '' \\n▁ ` ` except the deeper wisdom never surfaced , is that what you 're saying ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i just think sometimes you see the answer as being too simple , and you ignore your mind 's first response to things and bypass it , getting completely muddled up in the process of it all . \\n▁ but as you 're getting older , i ' m seeing you use that wisdom more and more , and it makes me worry a little less about leaving you . '' \\n▁ i quietly thought about that for a second , seeing how i could easily have taken insult to it but knowing he meant it as a compliment . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be okay , you know , even when you 're gone , david . \\n▁ i still have arthur . \\n▁ i know he 'll stay here and help me out as much he can . '' \\n▁ he nodded against the top of my head . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i ' ve actually spoken to him about it . '' \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` about caring for you when i ' m … '' he kissed my hair , squeezing me . \\n▁ ` ` i know you 'll be in good hands . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and i ' ve already picked out my cat . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that so ? '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` and what kind of cat is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` skittles . '' \\n▁ ` ` skittles ? '' \\n▁ he leaned back to look down at me . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i ' m gon na ask mom and dad if i can have him . '' \\n▁ he closed us into his hug again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure they 'll give you anything you want . '' \\n▁ i smiled , imagining skittles sitting on the foot of my bed . \\n▁ david would be gone , but it 'd be nice to have a little piece of home here with me . \\n▁ as long as i kept xxunk out of here . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk will eat that cat as soon as he sees it , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` were you just reading my mind ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , finding only amusement beneath the irritation . \\n▁ everything in my world just seemed to be back to normal again , even if it was only for five more minutes . \\n▁ it was a blissful five minutes at least . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` for forever ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for forever . '' \\n▁ the court noisily praised my last ruling as the defendant backed away and blended with the crowd again . \\n▁ today 's cases had mostly been fun ones , but i knew the next would be hard - to see eric for the first time in so long and then sentence his friend to some horrific punishment . \\n▁ a tall figure appeared on the balcony at the back of the room , leaning on the railing as if he was some bystander , a king pretending to be a commoner . \\n▁ i threw a gentle smile his way and looked back down at the accused : a young man with jet - black hair to his ears , piercings in every inch of flesh available , and tattoos like sleeves down his arms that were clearly there before he was turned . \\n▁ it seemed that some mistakes we made in life really did scar us for eternity . \\n▁ i was very glad then that i never snuck out to get that tattoo my friends all had done to mark our clique as one for forever . \\n▁ i cringed just thinking about the possible and eternal ramifications of that mistake . \\n▁ walter took centre stage to present adrian fernandez , a.k.a . lice , and informed the court and all its attendants of this man 's indiscretions . \\n▁ i listened as lice pleaded for mercy , falling to his knees at the base of the stairs , but his cries did nothing to melt my heart . \\n▁ ` ` you broke the law , adrian , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` the lead singer of your band is a good friend of mine , but that affords you no xxunk to the rules everyone else has to follow . '' \\n▁ ` ` please . '' \\n▁ he shook his clasped hands in the air . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't do it again . '' \\n▁ ` ` you should n't have done it in the first place . '' \\n▁ i looked up at the balcony for a second ; david was still there . \\n▁ ` ` if you loved this girl , planned to be with her , i might have understood , but you told her what you are in order to receive attention and praise . '' \\n▁ ` ` erm . '' \\n▁ walter cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk . '' \\n▁ i looked at walter ; he was trying not to laugh . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ he cleared his throat again and mumbled , ` ` he did it to receive , er … xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ um … '' i looked at the court again . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk . '' \\n▁ david coughed into his hand , folding over and turning away quickly to hide his laughter . \\n▁ ` ` and that girl is now dead because of your ego , '' i continued , feeling my cheeks go hot like a stone in the sun . \\n▁ ` ` in this order , we value all life : human , vampire , and lilithian alike . \\n▁ there are no exceptions . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was a mistake , majesty , i - '' ` ` a mistake you wo n't make again . '' \\n▁ i stood up , straightening my crown . \\n▁ ` ` i make my official ruling , and while it pains me to do this - leaving eric without a drummer , leaving the world without your musical talents - it is also not my doing . \\n▁ you broke our law , knowing the consequences . \\n▁ i hereby sentence you to a week in the crypt - '' the crowd gasped . \\n▁ adrian 's hands fell to the floor to hold him up . \\n▁ ` ` you may have a dose of blood before you 're entombed , given that this is your first offence , but you will have no other comforts . '' \\n▁ ` ` please ? '' \\n▁ he cried again as my knights lifted him to his feet . \\n▁ i held my hand up , a warning to talk no more . \\n▁ ` ` please ? '' \\n▁ he cried again , his hollow voice echoing as the guard dragged him away , one of the men drawing a syringe of created venom from his sword belt in case adrian decided to make a scene . \\n▁ he shut up quickly when he saw it , and walked away with his dignity intact . \\n▁ in the front row a pair of black eyes met mine . \\n▁ eric gave a small nod and moved his mouth to say , ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ i did n't smile back . \\n▁ it was so very good to see him , but when my feet were planted to this stage , in front of hundreds of people from my community , i had to be their queen - i , essentially , had no friends . \\n▁ i moved my stern gaze away from eric , all the way across the crowd to walt 's very surprised face . \\n▁ ` ` next case , walter . '' \\n▁ he cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` uh , yes , your majesty . \\n▁ case number fifty - five . \\n▁ harrison versus yeardley . '' \\n▁ above the court , david looked down on all the people , nodding toward me once before slinking back into the shadows . \\n▁ but i heard his voice enter my thoughts , distracting me a little from court as he disappeared , good job , he said . \\n▁ i ' m proud of you . \\n▁ i smiled at my feet then turned my focus back to the case report . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ eric threw his arms around me . \\n▁ i hugged him back fiercely . \\n▁ ` ` it 's so good to see you again . \\n▁ how have you been ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m good , yeah . '' \\n▁ he leaned out from the hug . \\n▁ ` ` band 's doing well . \\n▁ just released our first album and , well , i 'll have to tell the public that lice is in rehab or something for the next seven days but , yeah , we 're all good . '' \\n▁ ` ` i feel bad for you , eric . \\n▁ i know adri - i mean , lice , is a friend - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he stepped back to stuff his hands in his pockets . \\n▁ ` ` say no more . \\n▁ he knew the rules . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and i ' m sorry you had to kill that girl . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` are you kidding ? \\n▁ ara , i ' m a vamp - '' ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i palmed my head . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ i forget you do n't mind a bit of homicide . '' \\n▁ his easy smile brought me back to my hometown for a moment , flooding me with memories . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk to see ya again , kiddo . '' \\n▁ ` ` you too , eric . \\n▁ i missed you . '' \\n▁ he went to speak , but stopped , looking up as david approached . \\n▁ ` ` hey , man . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey . '' \\n▁ david hugged him , and they both broke into a series of manly back pats . \\n▁ ` ` long time , man . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ eric stood back , allowing room for david to stand beside me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's been a good run . \\n▁ how you been ? '' \\n▁ david shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` been better . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ tough break , man . \\n▁ i heard about the dagger . '' \\n▁ david nodded , but quickly pasted a smile in place . \\n▁ ` ` you stayin ' for dinner ? '' \\n▁ eric grinned , looking at me . \\n▁ ` ` depends what 's on the menu . '' \\n▁ david laughed , wrapping his elbow over eric 's neck as we walked out of the throne room . \\n▁ ` ` we both know what will happen if you ever taste my wife 's blood . '' \\n▁ ` ` worth the risk , '' eric said . \\n▁ ` ` on the bright side , '' i cut in . \\n▁ ` ` it might just be a way to resurrect you from the dead , david . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` hey , kiddo . '' \\n▁ eric landed in a lazy heap on the leather sofa next to me , making it squeak with protest , the sound echoing through the library . \\n▁ ` ` hey , eric . '' \\n▁ his cheeky grin spread across his face like a wild party , promising exciting things if only i let myself go with him . \\n▁ ` ` what y ' up to ? '' \\n▁ ` ` reading . '' \\n▁ i tucked my legs up to one side , leaning more on the arm of the sofa to angle away from him . \\n▁ ` ` and you 're too close for my husband 's liking . '' \\n▁ his smile grew . \\n▁ i did n't see it , but i felt it . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not here to protest . '' \\n▁ i shut my book . \\n▁ clearly , eric was out for some fun tonight or , at the very least , some fun company . \\n▁ ` ` ca n't sleep ? '' \\n▁ he shrugged , his shoulders looking kind of bony in that plain back tee . \\n▁ ` ` have n't seen ya in ages . \\n▁ just wanted to catch up without the ` fold ' around . '' \\n▁ ` ` by fold , you mean … ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the followers . '' \\n▁ he made quotation marks in the air with his fingers . \\n▁ ` ` the many who love and protect their queen . \\n▁ most of all , that power - hungry vampire you call a king . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey . '' \\n▁ i backhanded his arm . \\n▁ ` ` that 's my husband you 're talking about . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ he sat back , resting his hands in his lap . \\n▁ ` ` coulda fooled me . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i mean … '' he leaned on my thigh to push himself up , then wandered across the room to pore aimlessly over book spines . \\n▁ ` ` he 's changed , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` so everyone keeps saying , '' i said flatly , dumping my book on the end table . \\n▁ ` ` he 's just under a lot of pressure . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you keep saying . '' \\n▁ he waited a few seconds , then turned at the shoulder to flash me a grin . \\n▁ ` ` so … what you readin ' ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , um . '' \\n▁ i reached across and laid my notepad over the title of the book . \\n▁ ` ` just researching . '' \\n▁ ` ` researching , '' he said slowly , as if drawing out the word would prompt an explanation from me . \\n▁ ` ` stuff . '' \\n▁ ` ` stuff , huh ? '' \\n▁ his whole body bounced with his casual nod . \\n▁ ` ` aide - xxunk de xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey ! '' \\n▁ i stood up and grabbed my book from his sudden thieving paws , shoving his chest after . \\n▁ he took a few steps back , kind of stumbling from the force , and jammed his hands in his pockets , laughing . \\n▁ ` ` do n't try to hide things from a guy two - times faster than you . '' \\n▁ ` ` you had no right to do that . '' \\n▁ i put the book back down on the table he 'd stolen it from . \\n▁ ` ` then do n't lie to me . '' \\n▁ he stepped back into my circle of fury . \\n▁ ` ` why are you reading that ? \\n▁ what happened here while i was gone ? '' \\n▁ i pressed my hip distractedly . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing ? '' \\n▁ he said , suddenly beside me again , but this time lifting my top . \\n▁ i yanked it back down . \\n▁ ` ` get off . '' \\n▁ ` ` what happened to your skin ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not nothing , ara . \\n▁ come on . '' \\n▁ he held both hands out , palms raised . \\n▁ ` ` talk to me . \\n▁ you know i got your back , kiddo . '' \\n▁ my lip quivered for a second before i drew back the grief and replaced it with fighting strength . \\n▁ ` ` it happened after the lighthouse . '' \\n▁ ` ` the lighthouse ? '' \\n▁ he followed me to where i sat back on the sofa . \\n▁ ` ` after you fell ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` but xxunk says it 's a mark of betrayal . '' \\n▁ ` ` betrayal ? '' \\n▁ he almost slipped off the seat . \\n▁ ` ` what the hell 'd you do , girl ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure . \\n▁ i … i do n't remember . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk ! '' \\n▁ he scoffed , flipping his hair back with one hand . \\n▁ ` ` convenient . '' \\n▁ ` ` i really do n't , eric . \\n▁ i ' m not lying . '' \\n▁ his head turned very slowly until his foggy brown eyes met mine ; he searched inside my soul for a moment then looked away . \\n▁ ` ` do you suspect foul play ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ ` ` have you told david you think it 's a mark of … betrayal ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he thinks it 's a rash . \\n▁ he has n't seen it since it went dark and took on the shape of letters . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you have n't had sex with him ? '' \\n▁ he asked playfully . \\n▁ i was n't sure if i should answer . \\n▁ ` ` last time we did , the rash was n't as bad but … after i woke up the next morning , it was searing hot and the symbols had taken on real shape . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , what , making love to your husband makes the rash worse ? '' \\n▁ he suggested as well as asked . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you 're allergic to him . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha - ha . '' \\n▁ i reached over and flicked his earlobe . \\n▁ ` ` funny . '' \\n▁ he sat back , exhaling rather loudly for the quiet space we were in , then lopped his arm over the back of the sofa and around my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` forget reading for tonight . \\n▁ you can investigate memory loss and icky rashes all day tomorrow . \\n▁ but you ' ve only got me for one night . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what do you suggest we do ? '' \\n▁ i sat up and removed his arm from my body . \\n▁ ` ` jog your memory . '' \\n▁ his lips angled into that sharp grin i loved . \\n▁ ` ` how will we do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` go jump off a lighthouse . '' \\n▁ i held my awkward smile , not sure if he was kidding or not , shaping it into a frown when he stood up and offered me his hand . \\n▁ ` ` come on , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` who knows ? \\n▁ maybe if we sit up there and watch the sun rise for a bit , you might remember something . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i took his hand and stood . \\n▁ ` ` but quaid 's coming with us . '' \\n▁ ` ` quaid ? '' \\n▁ he looked over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` why him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's my night guard . \\n▁ i take him everywhere . '' \\n▁ eric 's brows shot up to his hairline . \\n▁ ` ` wow . \\n▁ things have changed around here . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` i ' ve missed this place , '' eric said , dangling his legs over the platform and into the abyss below . \\n▁ i sat down beside him , hugging the railing with both my arm and my chin . \\n▁ ` ` so , if you miss it so much , why not come back to us ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't . \\n▁ i finally have a life , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` you had a life here . '' \\n▁ ` ` i had a job here , following you around and offering advice . \\n▁ no offence . '' \\n▁ he bumped me with his elbow . \\n▁ ` ` i got better things to do with my eternity . '' \\n▁ ` ` fair enough , '' i said , casting my attention then on the yellow glow reaching out to sea from behind us , lighting up my hands and making eerie shadows of the rocks below each time it passed . \\n▁ the fierce wind roared up here , whipped past the metal railing , shaking everything that was n't made of iron , while the sea called beneath us - hundreds of meters down where it bashed the rocks in some angry attempt to prove greater might than the land . \\n▁ my hair moved around my face in a wild dance , strapping my eyes every few seconds , leaving them kind of teary with the sting . \\n▁ ` ` i love the way the ocean smells when it 's late at night , '' eric said . \\n▁ ` ` mm . '' \\n▁ i smiled , watching the dark sky with almost new eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i think the glow of the stars gives it an almost richer , more dreamy flavour . '' \\n▁ ` ` god , girl . \\n▁ do n't go all poetic on me . '' \\n▁ he reached into his pocket . \\n▁ ` ` the king might have cause to worry ` bout your intentions . '' \\n▁ ` ` what , between you and i ? '' \\n▁ i scoffed . \\n▁ ` ` in your dreams . '' \\n▁ he just smirked , looking out to sea again , tapping a small , silver case about the size of a card deck against his leg . \\n▁ ` ` i sat in on a class today . '' \\n▁ ` ` class ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ down at the barracks . '' \\n▁ he flipped the case open and offered me the contents . \\n▁ i declined with a scrunched - up nose . \\n▁ ` ` mike 's got some pretty good stuff goin ' on down there . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i came to sit in on the ` how to kill a vampire without venom ' and ` putting a vamp down in three - seconds ' lectures last month . '' \\n▁ ` ` blade was giving that one today - to the xxunk . '' \\n▁ he lit a smoke , cupping his hand around it so the flame would n't blow out in the wind , then shook the match and dropped it over the edge . \\n▁ ` ` they ' ve got this one move , where they jam a dagger into the back of the neck - '' he used the two fingers holding the smoke to make a line over the top of his spine , '' - slip it between the third and fourth vertebrae or something , '' he said suggestively . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , severs the spinal cord and sends them down fast . \\n▁ takes at least a day to rejuvenate . '' \\n▁ ` ` unless you 're lilithian . '' \\n▁ ` ` in which case , you die . '' \\n▁ he drew on his cigarette , puffing the fumes out with ` ` and the guns are new . '' \\n▁ i laughed , thinking about mike 's face when he first opened the crates . \\n▁ ` ` the bullets are spiked , you know ? \\n▁ some with created and some with pureblood venom . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ mike gave me one - a gun . '' \\n▁ ` ` seriously ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ just the created venom , though . \\n▁ told me to watch out for drake . \\n▁ said it was standard issue now - all guards and knights keep one on their sword belts . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` they all keep a syringe handy , too - just in case they need to arrest someone that puts up a fight . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he took a puff of that smoke again and blew it out . \\n▁ ` ` they took lice down with it today . '' \\n▁ ` ` did they ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ once they got him around the corner , they jammed it in his neck . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry about that . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk . '' \\n▁ he moved his shoulder up . \\n▁ ` ` he was puttin ' up a bit of a fight . '' \\n▁ ` ` i would have , too . '' \\n▁ he laughed then , nodding . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , did mike show you how to shoot a vampire ? \\n▁ 'cause those bullets wo n't go through bone . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he flicked his cigarette bud over the edge and the little flickering orange glow burned its way out of sight . \\n▁ ` ` he said to aim for the eye - that the bullet bounces off the skull of a vampire and stays inside , just jumpin ' around . '' \\n▁ he tapped his head . \\n▁ ` ` mashing up the brain . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yup . \\n▁ or go for the belly . '' \\n▁ i made a gun - like motion to my own belly . \\n▁ ` ` balls work well , too . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha ! \\n▁ i bet . '' \\n▁ he leaned forward and stuffed his smoke case in his back pocket . \\n▁ ` ` so , do you get a gun ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nah . \\n▁ i have a sword , but i do n't walk around with it on me . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? \\n▁ king does . '' \\n▁ i thought about how sexy david looked with that sword hanging down by his leg , all tall and strong and stern , kinda like an eighteenth - century prince . \\n▁ ` ` i have a dozen or so guards that carry swords . \\n▁ i do n't need it . '' \\n▁ ` ` fairs enough . '' \\n▁ i smiled , resting my chin on the railing . \\n▁ the night seemed to have worn on to morning across the far horizon too quickly , leaving the ocean with an almost red glow as far out as the eye could see . \\n▁ ` ` sailor 's warning , '' i said , nodding toward it . \\n▁ ` ` huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the red sky . \\n▁ they say that if it 's red at night , it 's a sailor 's delight - '' ` ` right . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` red sky in morning , a sailor 's warning . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve heard that one before ? '' \\n▁ ` ` kiddo , i was in the navy for a decade . '' \\n▁ ` ` what navy ? '' \\n▁ he looked slowly away . \\n▁ ` ` it was a long time ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` when you were human ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' he said , his shoulders sinking a little . \\n▁ ` ` do you miss being human ? '' \\n▁ his lips moved quickly into that coy grin , making his eyes light up . \\n▁ ` ` not even a little bit . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ i wrapped my arm across his waist and gave him a little squeeze . '' \\n▁ 'cause i like you as a vampire . \\n▁ you 're cocky and kinda sadistic , but there 's no one else like you , eric . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll take that as a compliment . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is , silly . '' \\n▁ i laughed , and he laid his arm over mine , patting my elbow a few times . \\n▁ when i first met him , i always thought music was the way david connected to the deeper , more soulful part inside himself . \\n▁ he never played for show , never paraded himself or his musical talents , and was never arrogant about it . \\n▁ but i never saw in him the emotion i saw in other true musicians when they 'd play alone - when they thought no one else was around . \\n▁ i could sit at the piano and play for hours , tears streaming down my cheeks , the very soul of the song coming to life because of me . \\n▁ and i 'd watched david sit for hours , too - snuck up and hid behind the door to the great hall - waited for the sad song he was playing to draw some raw emotion from him . \\n▁ but never . \\n▁ not once . \\n▁ he played , but he never let go . \\n▁ i stood by the bedroom door , my arms folded , and watched him where he sat on the bed with his guitar across his lap , his thoughts somewhere out there on the day over the balcony ledge . \\n▁ he played a sad song , sitting slightly more hunched than he usually did , and sang the words as if he was compelled to , yet was n't really performing either - he was just singing for himself . \\n▁ and this - the curve of his spine , the angle of his chin against the grasp of the world , and the very absence of that smile in his eyes - was his tell . \\n▁ this was his raw emotion shining through . \\n▁ he would never bleed tears into an empty room . \\n▁ he would never let emotion come up on its own and steal his composure , but his body could n't pretend he felt no pain in his heart . \\n▁ i walked over and sat behind him on the bed , wrapping one hand under his arm and turning it to cup his shoulder , laying my cheek on the other . \\n▁ ` ` everything okay ? '' \\n▁ he received my affection with what sounded like a breath of relief , gently resting his jaw against my eyebrow . \\n▁ ` ` it is now . '' \\n▁ ` ` good , '' i whispered back , smiling into his shoulder blade . \\n▁ ` ` what you doing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just watching you sing . '' \\n▁ he glanced back at the open door and sighed , shaking his head as he turned his gaze on the day again . \\n▁ ` ` i thought i shut that . '' \\n▁ ` ` you did . \\n▁ i opened it . '' \\n▁ he nodded to himself . \\n▁ ` ` hey , david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , my love . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m worried . '' \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` about … '' i sat up on my knees and massaged his shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` there 's something … wrong . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's this lighthouse thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` what about it , my love . '' \\n▁ he laid the guitar down on the bed and turned when i did n't answer , taking my hand off his shoulder to hold it . \\n▁ ` ` i can see how upset you are by this . \\n▁ what is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's … i get this feeling . '' \\n▁ ` ` feeling ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i nodded , not really sure how to explain it . \\n▁ ` ` like i ' m forgetting something . '' \\n▁ he laughed and hooked his arm behind my back , pulling me around and into his lap . \\n▁ ` ` you are , my love . \\n▁ you have amnesia . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , i … i have a really bad feeling about it . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course you do , '' he said simply . \\n▁ ` ` you 're missing a part of your life , a section of events that happened , resulting in extreme pain and near death , and your mind is trying to make sense of it . \\n▁ it 's your instinct to survive , to find a reason something occurred and prevent it happening again . '' \\n▁ my shoulders relaxed . \\n▁ ` ` you think ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he lifted my hand from the buttons i was toying with and kissed it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , i feel like something bad happened . '' \\n▁ ` ` it did . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you fell off a lighthouse . '' \\n▁ i laughed , too , patting his chest before resting my face in the curve of his neck , his stubble prickling my eyebrow . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . \\n▁ i guess i ' m just not used to the sensation of losing my memory . '' \\n▁ ` ` you mean mind , '' he joked . \\n▁ ` ` be nice . '' \\n▁ i gave him a soft slap on the thigh . \\n▁ ` ` besides , it 's not just me who lost their mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mike did , too . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , what . \\n▁ do . \\n▁ you . \\n▁ mean ? '' \\n▁ he said each word more firmly , but with a hint of a smile in his tone . \\n▁ ` ` i mean … '' i sat up to look into his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` mike had a memory lapse that night , too . \\n▁ he said he 'd planned to take a new box of cuffs down to the training hall , but when he went to get them from the mailroom , they were gone . \\n▁ they 'd already been put in the hall . \\n▁ he asked around , and no one else had done it , but he had no memory of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you think this has something to do with your loss of memory ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` and … what could that possibly be ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` stop worrying about it , ara . '' \\n▁ he kissed my head and rubbed my back . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve looked into it , and i ca n't see any evidence of foul play , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` did you talk to jason - about the accusations that he erased my memory ? '' \\n▁ ` ` briefly . '' \\n▁ he tucked a strand of hair behind my ear . \\n▁ ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` and he said he had a few theories - that he would fill me in when i got back from elysium this week . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you 're okay with that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why would n't i be ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , he knows something , right ? \\n▁ so - '' ` ` ara , he does n't know anything of value . \\n▁ he has theories . \\n▁ i asked him , i probed to see if he might have erased yours or mike 's minds , but he did n't give any indication . \\n▁ and he 's a terrible liar . \\n▁ if he 'd done anything to you or to mike , it would ' ve come out in my interrogation . '' \\n▁ ` ` interrogation ? '' \\n▁ ` ` a brotherly interrogation , '' he said softly , running his hand down my arm . \\n▁ ` ` stop worrying . \\n▁ i really do n't think anything bad happened between you and mike that night . \\n▁ he 's always taken good care of you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ it 's not like i think he pushed me . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ he said , curious . \\n▁ ` ` because that was my first thought just now , when you said he had no memory . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ but it 's unlikely his lapse in memory is connected to yours . \\n▁ he was under a lot of stress back then . \\n▁ and as for you ? \\n▁ well , you hit your head pretty hard , ara . \\n▁ i think you 're just worrying too much . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i snuggled back into his neck . \\n▁ ` ` maybe . '' \\n▁ the ocean cooled the grounds around xxunk , sending its sweeping , stormy breeze low across the lands . \\n▁ the last two days , with david being home and , essentially , on holiday , the summer had been warm and the days longer and brighter . \\n▁ but i woke this morning to the sound of thunder and a great , raging storm going on in my heart as well as outside . \\n▁ we stood on the steps at the front of the manor , a taxi waiting by the fountain , the tears of farewell restrained by formalities , trying to let each other go . \\n▁ i focused on the softness of david 's fingers in mine , running my thumb down his nail . \\n▁ ` ` try to enjoy yourself at elysium , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` at least a little bit . '' \\n▁ he smiled , but it did n't reach his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m releasing prisoners i sentenced - some i locked away , never to be seen again , all because my queen has a too kind a heart . \\n▁ i ' m not sure i 'll enjoy this , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , but you 'll be a good boy and do it anyway , wo n't you ? '' \\n▁ he bowed mockingly . \\n▁ ` ` yes , my queen . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ i reached up and patted his head . \\n▁ ` ` now , run along like a good little king , and set your people free . '' \\n▁ he gave a breathy laugh as he turned on his heel , saving the last kiss for a journey across the wind from his lips , to his palm , to me catching and storing it in my pocket . \\n▁ ` ` be safe , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` be strong , ara . '' \\n▁ i bowed my head once . \\n▁ ` ` i will . '' \\n▁ ` ` catch ya later , kiddo . '' \\n▁ eric stepped up and hugged me . \\n▁ i breathed him in deep , committing all of him to memory . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure i 'll see you again . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure you will . '' \\n▁ he winked at me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll have to come back in twenty years and check out this hot daughter you 'll have . '' \\n▁ i slapped his arm softly . \\n▁ ` ` good thing i know you 're kidding , or i might be tempted to neuter you . '' \\n▁ he laughed loudly , his fangs showing under that cocky , carefree smile . \\n▁ ` ` good thing you think the best of me and actually thought i was joking . '' \\n▁ ` ` get outta here , '' i said playfully , shoving him . \\n▁ he backed away and stood beside david , copping a light punch in the arm . \\n▁ ` ` later , ara . '' \\n▁ quaid elbowed me as he passed . \\n▁ ` ` take care ' til i get back , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be okay . '' \\n▁ i jerked my head toward blade . \\n▁ ` ` he follows me when he 's not supposed to . '' \\n▁ quaid smiled at his three comrades . \\n▁ ` ` do n't break the record without me , guys . \\n▁ i 'll be back once i ' ve delivered the king . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 'll keep it on hold ' til then , '' falcon said , giving that cool nod of his . \\n▁ ` ` great . \\n▁ catch ya 's . '' \\n▁ ` ` later . '' \\n▁ blade waved once , and we turned away as david , quaid and eric piled into the car . \\n▁ ` ` what record ? '' \\n▁ i asked falcon . \\n▁ ` ` darts . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ you play darts ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just one of the many ways we fill in time when we 're not stalking you . '' \\n▁ i held still for a moment , watching falcon 's face carefully . \\n▁ and there it was : the tiniest hint of a smile . \\n▁ ` ` did you just make a joke ? '' \\n▁ he started walking inside as the car pulled away down the drive . \\n▁ ` ` seriously ? '' \\n▁ i probed . \\n▁ ` ` you have a bone of humour in your body ? '' \\n▁ he held the door open for me , and i ducked in under his arm , following emily . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m quite a funny guy when i ' m not around you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i bring out the worst in you , huh ? '' \\n▁ i said . \\n▁ his timid smile made me stop walking for a second . \\n▁ ` ` no , but my job brings out the serious side of me . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` well , i do n't know the funny side of you , falcon , but i know i feel safer with your serious side than i do with any other knight on the core . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he bristled with pride . \\n▁ ` ` why do you think i ' m in charge of the guard now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ blade slapped falcon on the shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` this guy should win an award for the size of the steel rod he can cram up his arse . '' \\n▁ emily and blade laughed their way down the corridor and out of sight , and i turned to offer falcon a sympathetic pout . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not here to earn friends , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` but they love you anyway . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ when i ' m not walking around with that steel rod wedged where the sun do n't shine . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , only when you 're off duty then . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` or off xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha ! '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` that was a pretty good one . '' \\n▁ ` ` like i said . '' \\n▁ he closed the front door . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not all business . '' \\n▁ chapter seven ` ` so , we ve addressed your tantrums - '' blade pointed to his thumb , '' - your naivety and , today , i want to talk some more about respect . '' \\n▁ ` ` respect ? '' \\n▁ i slid my bottom back on the tabletop and let my legs dangle . \\n▁ ` ` who am i not respecting ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not your respect for everyone else i have a problem with , ara . \\n▁ it 's theirs for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my knees , tucking my hands under them . \\n▁ ` ` the general population residing within these walls seems to hold you in reasonably high regard . \\n▁ i ' ve checked , talked with them about you , '' he said , pacing the floors again like he was lecturing at a university . \\n▁ ` ` it seems to be only your peers , you know , anyone who knew you before you were queen , that have n't taken a step back yet to notice this transformation you ' ve made . '' \\n▁ ` ` like who ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ emily said , and my eyes moved upward with blade 's to the girl leaning her arms over the railing on the second floor balcony . \\n▁ ` ` that 's one , '' blade said , turning back to me . \\n▁ ` ` morgaine 's not too bad . \\n▁ king david could use a lesson in the do 's and do n'ts of spousal control . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ so did emily . \\n▁ ` ` he wo n't be a problem now , blade , '' i said , shifting over , patting the spot next to me for em to join . \\n▁ ` ` he apologised for that , and it really … it 's not who he is . \\n▁ he 's just been having a hard time . '' \\n▁ blade bowed his head . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ that 's fine . \\n▁ but the thing is , ara , it 's not the other people we need to change . \\n▁ it 's you . '' \\n▁ ` ` we need to change me because they disrespect me ? '' \\n▁ i said flatly . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' emily added , scooping my hand up in hers . \\n▁ ` ` because you teach people how to treat you , ara . '' \\n▁ blade 's eyes went wider for a second , a warm smile narrowing them after . \\n▁ ` ` that 's right , emily , and you could take a leaf out of your own book , could n't you ? '' \\n▁ emily nodded , turning to me . \\n▁ ` ` ara , mike babies everyone if they let him . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , and you allow way too much of it , your majesty , '' blade said . \\n▁ ` ` as a human being , you deserve the respect and confidence of your friends and family but , as a queen , you must command it . '' \\n▁ ` ` command it ? '' \\n▁ i said . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ it happens one situation at a time , '' he explained . \\n▁ ` ` you stand tall and clearly warn the culprit to rephrase their statement , this time with a little respect . \\n▁ do that once or twice , majesty , and people will catch on that you believe you deserve better than to be spoken to like you 're a seventeen - year - old spoiled brat . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that what people think of me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not so much anymore . \\n▁ but there 's just a few who have n't woken up to smell the coffee . \\n▁ and you ' ve been so busy being sad over david not being here , followed by news of his impending death , that you have n't really noticed just how bad your people treat you . '' \\n▁ i brushed my thumb down emily 's , focusing only on that so i would n't cry . \\n▁ ` ` i think she has , blade , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` she 's not as tough as she looks . '' \\n▁ blade 's face appeared under my lowered gaze , his black eyes peering up at me softly . \\n▁ ` ` my queen , you do n't even realise how much your people actually love you . \\n▁ those who do n't are in the minority . '' \\n▁ ` ` it does n't feel that way . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but , hey , get this - '' he grinned at emily . \\n▁ ` ` ems and i took a stroll through lamia village the other day to see how it was thriving now , and when we got to the great water fountain in town square , there was this group of little human girls sitting on the steps . '' \\n▁ ` ` they were making garlands of blue paper roses to hang around their necks , ara , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` and i overheard one of the girls call herself princess amara , '' blade finished . \\n▁ my heart melted . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ honest to god . '' \\n▁ blade tapped his heart . \\n▁ ` ` you and david are n't just the king and queen , struggling to rule and be in love . \\n▁ you 're figures in history ; stories parents tell their children . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's pretty cool . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ blade laughed , standing up again . \\n▁ ` ` so do n't feel so alone , okay , ara ? \\n▁ you 're not . \\n▁ your people love you , and respect you . \\n▁ but you need to realise that you 're the queen , not a girl fresh out of high school with no relevance or training . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , ara , '' emily added . \\n▁ ` ` if you think about it , you know more about the laws , systems , and history than almost any of us . '' \\n▁ my mind wandered to this morning 's lesson with morgaine on lilithian and vampire politics and history - a lesson i , for once , stayed awake for , realising now , more than ever , how important it was that i knew all that stuff . \\n▁ very soon , there 'd be no king to save me from myself . \\n▁ i needed to - had to - understand how to do this on my own or , when david was gone , everything would fall apart . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right , em , '' i said , feeling the realisation flood my system like water rising . \\n▁ ` ` i probably know more than anyone here , aside from arthur and morgaine . \\n▁ and no one , not xxunk , walt , not even mike , has the right to speak to me like i ' m a child . '' \\n▁ ` ` right , '' em said , her smile radiating as she looked at blade . \\n▁ ` ` so , what are you gon na do about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um . '' \\n▁ i did n't know . \\n▁ not really . \\n▁ ` ` i guess , now that i ' ve addressed it as an issue , i 'll just have to put myself to the test next time a situation arises . '' \\n▁ emily looked at blade . \\n▁ he shrugged , nodding . \\n▁ he seemed happy enough with that . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll stand back on this one , majesty . \\n▁ let you find your own feet , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` but if you need any advice , or encouragement , look to me for a quick nod . '' \\n▁ i gave one in return . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , blade . '' \\n▁ ` ` any time . '' \\n▁ he reached back to the table nearby and grabbed a notepad and pen . \\n▁ ` ` now , i want you taking notes for this part , because you 're going to learn all the loopholes in the laws you can and can not be overruled on , and those you can be punished for breaking . '' \\n▁ ` ` great , '' i said , and i meant that . \\n▁ up until now , learning anything made my eyes roll , as if i was back in school , being treated like a kid again . \\n▁ but , in suffering curiosity and xxunk for too long , i 'd come to realise just how important it was to be informed . \\n▁ if i knew what i was talking about , no one had cause to argue with me or doubt me . \\n▁ he was small , just a dot on the horizon , almost completely shadowed by the two giant cliffs guarding either side of the small beach , but before i even reached the steep steps leading down to the sand , i knew it was jase . \\n▁ he crossed his arm over his body and under his elbow , then flicked it out quickly toward the waves , sending a small stone skipping across the choppy surface as best it could considering the almost violent conditions out there today . \\n▁ i could tell , even from up here on the cliff side , that something was troubling him - could tell he came out here to be alone , but i did n't really care . \\n▁ i needed some space , too , and my skin had been craving the fury of the ocean for about a week now . \\n▁ we were n't supposed to be in the same space alone but , if one of us was leaving , i was sorry to say it 'd have to be him . \\n▁ ` ` hey , '' he called , without even turning around . \\n▁ ` ` how 'd you know i was here ? '' \\n▁ i projected my voice over the noise of the wind , even though i knew he could hear me just fine . \\n▁ a habit , i guess . \\n▁ ` ` i can smell you . '' \\n▁ he turned slightly and smiled at me , then ditched another stone from his handful into the water . \\n▁ ` ` but i was downwind . '' \\n▁ ` ` trust me , ara . \\n▁ my senses are very finely tuned when it comes to you . \\n▁ i could smell you before you even knew you were coming this way . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ i laughed too , closing my shawl around my chest as i stopped beside him . \\n▁ ` ` hey , did you get that reading you were trying for at training the other day ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` and now i need a new xxunk , thanks to your telekinesis . '' \\n▁ ` ` telekinesis ? '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` what d'you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's how you threw him . '' \\n▁ ` ` i thought it was my light . '' \\n▁ i waved my fingers . \\n▁ ` ` your light does n't have that kind of power . \\n▁ maybe to knock someone back with the blast , but not pick them right up and toss them aside . '' \\n▁ he threw another stone . \\n▁ i reached across and stole one from the cup of his palm . \\n▁ ` ` show me how . '' \\n▁ ` ` how what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` show me how to do it . '' \\n▁ he looked at the stone in my flat hand , then dropped his collection on the wet sand at his feet , the pebbles scattering like pearly black diamonds . \\n▁ ` ` on one condition . '' \\n▁ ` ` anything . '' \\n▁ i smiled sheepishly . \\n▁ ` ` well , almost anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` you keep everything i teach you a secret . '' \\n▁ he wrapped both hands over my own and the stone . \\n▁ ` ` they all believe your blue light threw that knight , ara , and it 's probably safer if you keep it that way . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` okay , agreed . \\n▁ but what about david ? '' \\n▁ a thin smile stretched his lips . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd never ask you to keep something from your husband , ara . \\n▁ you can tell whoever you like , as long as you trust them . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i looked at my hand all tucked up and warm in his . \\n▁ ` ` i accept the terms of our agreement . \\n▁ now , show me how to make it move . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ well , you only discovered this because of your survival instinct . \\n▁ quite often , a vampire 's power can lay dormant for thousands of years , until a situation arises where they need to use it . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , i could have more powers i do n't know about ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , '' he said with a small laugh . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't even begin to imagine the potential within you . \\n▁ you 're not only a child of lilith 's blood , but you 're also deemed a goddess by mother nature . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that means i ' m supposed to be magnificently powerful ? '' \\n▁ i asked disbelievingly . \\n▁ ` ` not just powerful , sweet girl , a force to be reckoned with , something that should scare the wits out of any man who opposes you . '' \\n▁ i smiled at my own small hand , so feeble against his long , ancient and athletic fingers . \\n▁ ` ` i can just see drake shaking in his boots now . '' \\n▁ his hand tightened around mine . \\n▁ ` ` he should be . '' \\n▁ ` ` he will be , when i figure out how to use this power . '' \\n▁ i grinned up at jase 's very slight dimple - the one he 'd get when he was enjoying something . \\n▁ ` ` now , stop stalling just so you can hold my hand , and show me how to do it . '' \\n▁ he laughed , but we both knew he was n't really stalling . \\n▁ ` ` okay , as i was saying before , you found the ability because you had the need for it . \\n▁ so , i want you to imagine i ' m trying to steal this stone from you , and i want you to use your mind to throw it into the ocean . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ but since we 're role playing , why are you trying to steal it ? '' \\n▁ he thought for a second , looking up when the idea struck him . \\n▁ ` ` because if i get it , you have to let me kiss you . '' \\n▁ my spine straightened . \\n▁ ` ` on the lips , '' he added . \\n▁ i pictured it for a second , and before our lips even touched , an imaginary david came down and ripped jason 's arms out of their sockets , laid his face down on the boulder by our feet and smashed his heel into the back of jason 's head , knocking all his teeth out . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` give me your word . '' \\n▁ he held out his pinkie . \\n▁ i linked mine over it . \\n▁ ` ` you have my word . \\n▁ if you get the stone , i 'll kiss you . '' \\n▁ ` ` he will hurt me when he sees the kiss in your thoughts , ara . \\n▁ it 's not a joke . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you better hope you 're not wrong about me having telekinesis . '' \\n▁ ` ` hoping ? '' \\n▁ he took a step back and crouched down , pulling his jeans up his legs a little . \\n▁ ` ` ara , i ' m praying right now . '' \\n▁ i looked at his white teeth under that smile , and a faint memory of what those lips felt like flooded my senses . \\n▁ ` ` ara , '' he said , his tone playful but warning . \\n▁ ` ` you better start moving that stone . '' \\n▁ i jerked my hand back as he swiped at it , almost catching it in his palm , but my so - called powers did n't surface . \\n▁ so , i ran - turned on my heel and bolted down the beach , my feet sinking into the softer sand further away from the waves . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't run from me , '' he called . \\n▁ ` ` and human pace wo n't even give you two - seconds ' reprieve . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't run like a vampire when i ' m concentrating , '' i called over my shoulder , half noticing falcon on top of the lighthouse as i turned back , watching on : the protective knight . \\n▁ i knew there was no way he 'd hear us from all the way up there , and a part of me wondered what he thought we were up to , running along the beach like a couple of kids , with me screaming and dodging jason 's every leap to grab me , and him laughing in such a carefree , boyish way , it almost sounded like he was happy . \\n▁ ` ` stop concentrating , '' jase said , nearly catching the hem of my dress . \\n▁ ` ` the point of adding high stakes is so you 're not thinking about anything but fight or flight . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's clearly not working . '' \\n▁ i ducked as he lunged toward me again , then took a quick side step at the cliff wall and darted down the beach in the other direction , leaving jason face down in the sand , laughing . \\n▁ ` ` you 're enjoying this chase a little too much , i think , '' i said , stealing a glance to see how far away he was , but my face hit the rock hard centre of his chest instead , and i fell back on my hands , dropping the stone somewhere in the sand . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not trying very hard , ara . '' \\n▁ he stood above me , his eyes scanning the yellow grains around the circumference of my body . \\n▁ ` ` that 's the sad part . '' \\n▁ i got up on my hands and knees and sifted through the sand . \\n▁ ` ` i actually am . '' \\n▁ ` ` if you 're hoping to find it before i do , i wish you luck . '' \\n▁ his voice was littered with amusement ; his arms crossed over his baseball shirt , with the cuffs of his jeans wet and folded up above his bare feet . \\n▁ he was waiting for me to find it , i just knew , and it was either so he could steal it and win his kiss , or to prompt me to use this power he was sure i had . \\n▁ but i just was n't that convinced he was even right . \\n▁ ` ` which is why you ran in the first place , '' he said smugly . \\n▁ ` ` shut up , jason . '' \\n▁ i felt a stone pass under my fingertips , and moved my hands opposite it to throw him off . \\n▁ ` ` just because you 're a scientist , does n't mean you know everything . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not just a scientist , ara . '' \\n▁ he knelt down and dug into the sand right by my heel , standing up again with the stone in hand ; i sat back on my thighs , gasping silently . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m a century - old vampire who has seen the birth of every scientific and medical advance in the most significant age of science known to man , and i know - '' he held up the stone , '' - exactly what i ' m talking about . '' \\n▁ i stood up , dusting my hands off on my dress . \\n▁ ` ` what do you want , jason ? \\n▁ is this whole thing really just so you can get a kiss from a married woman ? '' \\n▁ he smirked at the stone between his fingertips , his eyelids thinning into smaller slits until they closed and the stone rose above his palm , floating mid air . \\n▁ ` ` open your hand . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ emerald green shone out as he looked directly into me . \\n▁ ` ` open your hand , ara . '' \\n▁ i slowly rolled my palm flat , and the stone wandered across the space between us and landed gently there like an invisible man had moved it . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't need to play games to steal a kiss . \\n▁ in fact , i do n't need to steal a kiss , and let me make one more thing clear to you , ara - rose . \\n▁ i do n't want to kiss you . '' \\n▁ i swallowed , closing my fingers over the stone , the cool wind whipping my hair and shawl outward toward the cliffs . \\n▁ ` ` i am here to help you , '' he continued . \\n▁ ` ` to help my brother , and anything i have ever done in contradiction since i came to this manor was purely in either yours or his best interests . \\n▁ i may love you , ara - '' he stepped closer , cupping my tight fist . \\n▁ ` ` but that love only gives me perfect reason to do anything to avoid my lips touching yours , because the repercussions of that kiss would not just affect me , they 'd affect david and , in turn , you . '' \\n▁ the lump in my throat would n't shift . \\n▁ he was right . \\n▁ but he had won that kiss fair and square , except i knew it would n't end on this beach . \\n▁ falcon would see . \\n▁ i would know it happened and , when david found out , which he would because i 'd tell him , jason would be on stable duty for the next year , if david was in a good mood . \\n▁ i tried not to look at him , but his eyes were locked onto mine , holding me to his gaze , his thoughts xxunk on the moment our lips would touch - after so , so long . \\n▁ ` ` you owe me a kiss , '' he said softly , and his fingers closed around mine , making my skin burn , gradually getting hotter and hotter like water on a stove . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing to me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` helping you find your will to fight . '' \\n▁ he took the last step into me and cupped my chin , rolling my face upward so our lips aligned , leaving just an inch and a warm breath between us . \\n▁ i could n't feel the ice on the wind anymore , did n't care that falcon was behind us or that the ocean tide had moved in as we stood here , getting dangerously close to our feet . \\n▁ the only thing i felt was the roiling cloud of fear in my gut , swirling and thickening at the taste of his breath , sparking the memory of his smooth lips . \\n▁ i could n't do it , though . \\n▁ i knew he was waiting - knew he was respectful enough to make it my choice , on my honour . \\n▁ but i could n't keep my word . \\n▁ and it was n't because david would tear jason apart if i did , but that the reason david would do it is because the kiss would hurt him more . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ i lowered my weight back onto my heels , but stayed close to him - chest to chest , hand to hand , faces angled for a kiss , and the heat in my palm seared around the stone . \\n▁ ` ` you 're hurting me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not doing that , '' he said smugly , laughing a little as he looked down at my hand . \\n▁ my fingers were bright pink , small clouds of steam billowing up through the cracks between them , while the scent of melting flesh made my nose twitch . \\n▁ ` ` that 's incredible . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase , i mean it . \\n▁ it hurts . \\n▁ stop it . '' \\n▁ he pulled his hand away , stepping back , but the burning intensified . \\n▁ ` ` only you can stop it , ara . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my hand : the fist was fused shut by melted flesh , my whole arm shaking violently . \\n▁ ` ` jase , '' i said , panic rising in my tone . \\n▁ ` ` please . \\n▁ i do n't know how to make it stop . '' \\n▁ ` ` drop the stone . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't . '' \\n▁ my hand would n't open . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he took a step closer and the heat raged , as if his skin , his breath , maybe his soul , set the rock in my hand alight . \\n▁ ` ` ara , fun 's over . \\n▁ drop it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't . '' \\n▁ i cried out , landing on my knees in the sand , digging and scraping at my hand to force it open . \\n▁ ` ` what is this stone ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's just a rock . '' \\n▁ he knelt beside me . \\n▁ ` ` just a normal rock from the ground . '' \\n▁ ` ` why is it so hot ? '' \\n▁ i practically screamed . \\n▁ ` ` your blue light , sweet girl . \\n▁ you 're on defensive - '' ` ` do n't , '' i yelled as he reached for my hand . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll make it worse . '' \\n▁ ` ` just let me - ah ! '' \\n▁ he folded in on himself , his face going bright red . \\n▁ ` ` ara , stop ! '' \\n▁ ` ` just get away from me , '' i said , pretty sure i 'd just zapped him without meaning to . \\n▁ ` ` i - '' he tried to stand , tried to walk away , then sunk to his knees . \\n▁ ` ` ara , stop ! '' \\n▁ i glanced up quickly to see him curled into a ball a few feet away . \\n▁ but i had n't done anything to him . \\n▁ he 'd probably just stepped on a jellyfish or something , or maybe he felt the heat , too , as if my electric light had surfaced without colour and hit him hard . \\n▁ but i did n't care . \\n▁ i needed to concentrate , needed to focus to get this stone out of my hand . \\n▁ i phased jason , the waves , the wind , the world , out , and imagined that the stone in my hand was just an ice cube , that the heat would melt it . \\n▁ ` ` focus , ara . \\n▁ focus , '' i mumbled and , all around me , a shimmer of blue light parted the shadows , taking the warmth around the stone and sending it through my entire body , leaving my palm cool and tingly and suddenly free . \\n▁ i unfolded my fingers , rolling my hand to tip the small droplet of water and the pile of sand grains onto the ground by my knee . \\n▁ the melted flesh bubbled and bled , then healed over , leaving the skin smooth and supple again . \\n▁ my lungs expanded , contracting slowly as the long breath i exhaled cooled my limbs . \\n▁ ` ` i melted it , '' i said to jason , my eyes filled with wonder , but his deep , almost restless groan snapped my thoughts back to the agonized screams still ringing in my ears . \\n▁ ` ` oh , my god . \\n▁ jase ! '' \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ he rolled into a tighter ball , cradling his arm in the circle of his body . \\n▁ ` ` get help . '' \\n▁ ` ` jason . \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ i touched his hip to roll him over , but my presence startled him ; he raised his wrist to block me , revealing the twisted , awkwardly bent position of his other arm : the wrist had snapped back one way , the forearm broken clean in half , his arm held on only by a thin thread of flesh that refused to give way . \\n▁ my first instinct was to rush in and help , but my body took over , sending my hand to my mouth to cover the scream . \\n▁ falcon appeared beside me , quickly sizing up the situation , but as he bent down to help the injured , even he drew back in blood - chilling shock . \\n▁ ` ` vampire 's bones do n't break , '' he said , grabbing my arm to move me away . \\n▁ ` ` what have you done to him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my hands , covering my face with them after . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ ` ` run , ara . '' \\n▁ he pointed up the steep steps . \\n▁ ` ` get arthur . '' \\n▁ ` ` why is he laying like that ? '' \\n▁ i cried instead . \\n▁ ` ` his arm 's broken . '' \\n▁ falcon knelt beside jason to take a look . \\n▁ ` ` he needs help . \\n▁ go ! '' \\n▁ jason groaned , barely able to catch a breath , obviously suffering more agony than he 'd ever felt . \\n▁ despite every ounce of damage i 'd ever seen him endure , this was , by far , the worst . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` now , ara ! '' \\n▁ falcon yelled . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * i reached out and grabbed arthur 's arm as he shut the bedroom door . \\n▁ ` ` how is he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's fine . '' \\n▁ he placed his medical kit on the ground by his feet and let out a breath through his nose , pulling me in for a very needed hug . \\n▁ ` ` he wants to see you . '' \\n▁ ` ` did he tell you how it happened ? '' \\n▁ i asked , stepping back . \\n▁ ` ` he did . '' \\n▁ arthur nodded , his distant eyes finding a smile a few seconds later . \\n▁ ` ` telekinesis , huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my hands . \\n▁ ` ` i guess so . '' \\n▁ arthur just shook his head , bending at the knees to pick up his bag , and walked away , shaking his head as a long whistle left his lips , carrying the sound of amazement down the hall with him . \\n▁ but i was n't amazed , or surprised . \\n▁ i 'd nearly ripped off the entire arm of a vampire , whose bones were like iron - coated cement . \\n▁ how on earth did i manage to hurt him that way ? \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ jason called , a mildly impatient tone coming out through the wooden door with his voice . \\n▁ i pushed it open and poked my head in , showing my teeth in an apologetic grin . \\n▁ ` ` stop it , '' he said , reaching his good hand out . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't need to apologise . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but … '' i nodded at his arm in its sling , closing the door with my foot . \\n▁ ` ` i also kind of do . '' \\n▁ he looked down at the broken appendage and just smiled . \\n▁ ` ` well , one thing i can safely say is , i have never ever felt so much pain , physical pain , in all my vampire life , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , do n't . '' \\n▁ i covered my ears . \\n▁ ` ` i already feel bad enough . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i ' m sure some people around here would praise you for it . '' \\n▁ he offered a timid smirk , to which i replied with a pout . \\n▁ ` ` take a seat , '' he said and patted the bed . \\n▁ ` ` i want to show you something . '' \\n▁ i sat down , eyeing the brown leather - bound journal tucked in beside his leg . \\n▁ ` ` when i first started developing my powers , the telekinesis was the worst - the hardest to control or accept . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he held the book up . \\n▁ ` ` i started taking notes , assessing myself , testing my limits . \\n▁ this - '' he passed it to me , and as i took hold of it , could actually feel the ancient energy within its pages - could almost see the past . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure this will help you on your journey , too , ara . \\n▁ i want you to have it . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is your journal ? '' \\n▁ i frayed the pages with my thumb , flipping it open to the first page . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and it contains many secrets about my powers , so you must promise to keep it safe . '' \\n▁ i hugged it to my chest . \\n▁ ` ` i promise . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ he nodded once and xxunk down a little deeper into his covers , closing his eyes , though he did n't give the impression he wanted to sleep . \\n▁ ` ` you did good today . '' \\n▁ ` ` i broke your arm . \\n▁ i hardly think that 's good . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't you ? '' \\n▁ he opened one eye . \\n▁ ` ` because i think that 's pretty damn amazing . '' \\n▁ true . \\n▁ it was kind of amazing . \\n▁ a little . \\n▁ if i really thought about it . \\n▁ ` ` well , '' i said lightly , standing up . \\n▁ ` ` next time you 'll think twice about making bets to win a kiss from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` your majesty , '' he scoffed , laughing , ` ` if that 's the pain i have to go through to kiss you , then , no offence , but i ' ve got better things to do with my time . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ so do i. '' ` ` yes , you ' ve got a whole lot of reading to do now . '' \\n▁ ` ` that , i do . '' \\n▁ i held the book up , laying it on the bed after , my thoughtful gaze falling on its leather binding . \\n▁ ` ` how 's your hand ? '' \\n▁ jason asked softly . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ i unfolded my fingers as he took it in his and traced a line down my palm . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't do it , you know ? '' \\n▁ he said . \\n▁ ` ` do what ? '' \\n▁ he drew my palm to his lips and kissed it . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't heat that stone . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry i thought you did . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't apologise , ara . '' \\n▁ he left my hand in his lap , still holding it . \\n▁ ` ` as soon as the pain stops , i 'll figure out how you did what you did , and then we 'll get started on mastering it . '' \\n▁ ` ` without david 's approval , huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he has no say in this . '' \\n▁ his green eyes bore into mine with stern appeal . \\n▁ ` ` you 're showing signs of a power he knows nothing about . \\n▁ husband or not , he ca n't stop me from helping you . '' \\n▁ ` ` when he finds out what happened , i ' m not sure he will . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i hope not . \\n▁ because you melted that stone , ara . \\n▁ i was in agony , never hurt so much in all my life , but i still saw you tip the water and sand remains away . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my hand , reliving that moment . \\n▁ ` ` do you think that 's another power ? \\n▁ melting things ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he closed his eyes and readjusted his head on the pillow . \\n▁ ` ` i think your blue light heated the stone - almost like a reverse xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ever seen what lightning does to sand ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` it strikes the ground at such a high temperature for such a short time that , when it retracts again , the ground cools quickly and the sand turns to glass . \\n▁ i think maybe you heated the stone enough to basically melt it back to sand again . '' \\n▁ ` ` whoa . \\n▁ that would have to be pretty hot , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` as hot as lightning . \\n▁ about three - thousand - two - hundred - and - seventy degrees fahrenheit to be exact . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you 're not sure yet if that 's what it was ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not yet . '' \\n▁ he winced , scrunching his eyes tight . \\n▁ ` ` but i will figure it out , ara . \\n▁ i promise you . '' \\n▁ when i looked up from the journal , his eyes were open again , swearing that promise to me with all his heart . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i leaned over and planted a kiss to his cheek . \\n▁ ` ` get some rest , jase . \\n▁ i 'll see ya later . '' \\n▁ ` ` later , ara , '' he said , and i closed his door behind me , shaking my head as a smile passed my lips for a moment . \\n▁ i knew i needed to go up and speak to arthur about all this now . \\n▁ i knew he would n't just walk away , amazed by it all . \\n▁ but i needed to tell someone more important first . \\n▁ ` ` you did what ! '' \\n▁ david 's shock came right through the phone line and made me grin . \\n▁ ` ` i … it just broke , david . \\n▁ like , just snapped in half . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ i heard him sigh . \\n▁ ` ` i took a tour through the vampiric institute of science a few years back - saw the xxunk test . '' \\n▁ ` ` the what now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the bro … it 's a demonstration , really , more than a test , where they pit vampire against machine . \\n▁ and these were powerful machines , ara . \\n▁ they 'd lay the vampire 's arm under it and attempt to break the bone . \\n▁ the test was conclusive each time , sweetheart ; one hundred per cent conclusive . \\n▁ the machines always failed . \\n▁ now , i ' m not trying to undermine you here , but are you sure it broke ? '' \\n▁ i just laughed to myself a little . \\n▁ ` ` you can talk to arthur , if you want . '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ he went quiet for a second . \\n▁ ` ` damn , ara . '' \\n▁ my smile grew . \\n▁ ` ` that 's amazing . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's what everyone says , '' i chirped . \\n▁ ` ` everyone ? \\n▁ who else have you told ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just you . \\n▁ i mean , arthur and falcon know , and obviously , jason , but no one else . '' \\n▁ david went quiet again . \\n▁ ` ` he 's okay , though , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ he 's healed now . \\n▁ it only took about six hours . '' \\n▁ ` ` six hours ? \\n▁ why did n't you call me the second it happened , ara ? \\n▁ if that much time has passed - '' ` ` i did . \\n▁ but we have n't been able to get hold of you . \\n▁ no service in the dungeons , remember ? '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ sorry . \\n▁ did n't think of that . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` now you 're just starting to sound like me . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , rather than sound like you , can i have your power , please ? '' \\n▁ he said , and i giggled . \\n▁ ` ` that 's not fair . \\n▁ you 're not supposed to be cooler than me . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , maybe you 'll get some wicked new talent soon . \\n▁ you ' ve only been officially sworn in on the stone for two weeks . '' \\n▁ ` ` very true . \\n▁ i guess i have a whole month worth of a lifetime to find out , right ? '' \\n▁ he said . \\n▁ my shoulders sunk . \\n▁ ` ` it would ' ve been nice to see how powerful you became after another century . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ but , perhaps i 'll pass that power down to my daughter . '' \\n▁ i laid a hand across my belly , thinking about what eve said . \\n▁ and a part of me wondered if maybe , in some small way , she meant that our child held the key to saving david . \\n▁ ` ` i did that pregnancy test . '' \\n▁ ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ i heard the smile in his voice . \\n▁ ` ` it was negative . '' \\n▁ a long moment of silence followed before his deep , whispery voice came down the line , distorted with a bit of static . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` there 's always next time , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` right , '' he said in an almost quick , insincere manner . \\n▁ ` ` now , what were you doing , exactly , when you broke my baby brother 's arm ? '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i was running away so i would n't have to kiss him . '' \\n▁ my ability to silence him surfaced again . \\n▁ ` ` okay , i ' m going to assume there 's quite a story behind that . '' \\n▁ ` ` there is . '' \\n▁ i sat down on my bed and crossed my legs . \\n▁ ` ` remember when i threw that guy at training the other day ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase said it was n't my blue light that did it . \\n▁ it was telekinesis . '' \\n▁ ` ` telekinesis ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm - hm . \\n▁ apparently i can snap bones with , too . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , just … i need a second to get my head around this . '' \\n▁ i smiled , letting him have his second . \\n▁ ` ` so , you have telekinesis ? \\n▁ you did n't snap his bone with your bare hands , but with … your mind ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ because i thought he was the one that was hurting me . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he told me i could move things with my mind , that the power had surfaced the other day out of necessity , and that if we could recreate a situation where i felt threatened , it would surface again . '' \\n▁ ` ` so he hurt you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ he tried to kiss me . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ he paused again , clearly seething on the other end of the line . \\n▁ ` ` just give me the full story from start to finish . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , well , he was throwing stones into the ocean , and i was headed down to the beach . \\n▁ i asked him to show me how to throw them with my mind , and he said we needed high stakes to force my power out of hiding . \\n▁ so we agreed that … '' ` ` the wager was a kiss ? '' \\n▁ david asked , but not in a dull , flat tone , more like he was laughing . \\n▁ ` ` um , yeah . \\n▁ we were playing keep - off . \\n▁ if he got the stone , i had to kiss him . '' \\n▁ ` ` and if he did n't get the stone ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' ` ` right . \\n▁ so he did n't believe for a second that you 'd actually use that power , did he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course he did . \\n▁ but i guess that was my grand prize - the knowledge of power . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ so you were running from him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ but , when he captured the stone and he was standing right in front of me , all geared up to accept his prize , i could n't do it . \\n▁ and i was holding the stone in my hand , and it got really hot . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i thought jase - '' ` ` jason , '' he warned . \\n▁ ` ` jason , '' i corrected , rolling my eyes , ` ` was doing it to me , you know , making it burn to make me fight . \\n▁ but even he got scared when my hand started melting . '' \\n▁ ` ` melting ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ the stone got so hot my hand fused shut and i could n't get it out . \\n▁ jason stepped in to help me , but i thought he 'd make it worse . \\n▁ so i kind of , i dunno , i did n't want him to touch me , and then he just fell to the floor . \\n▁ when the stone stopped burning , his arm was broken , and i do n't really remember doing it . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you remember how you got the stone to stop burning ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i melted it , '' i said simply . \\n▁ ` ` i felt it turn to cold glass in my hand , and then it just melted . '' \\n▁ ` ` you … you melted it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` uh - huh . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` okay , i ' m gon na need some time to process this , '' he said distractedly , then came back into the conversation with a completely different tone . \\n▁ ` ` on another note , did you go see arthur about that rash ? '' \\n▁ my hand went to my hip to scratch it . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ i inhaled to the deepest part of my lungs and let it out . \\n▁ according to the book xxunk showed me , the one safely back under my bed , i already knew what the rash was . \\n▁ i just was n't sure arthur could mix up a remedy to fix a mark of betrayal , and i was n't really sure what i 'd done wrong , either . \\n▁ so , until i figured this out , the last thing i wanted to do was tell anyone about it . \\n▁ ` ` he 's my uncle , david . \\n▁ i feel kind of funny talking to him about that stuff . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't be silly , ara . \\n▁ the fact that he is your uncle is exactly why you can talk to him about anything . \\n▁ and he 's seen it all , my love , not just every ailment known to man , but he 's seen your entirely naked body , too . \\n▁ who do you think stitched your organs back in after you fell off the lighthouse ? '' \\n▁ i cringed . \\n▁ ` ` so do n't feel embarrassed around him . \\n▁ just go show him and let him fix you . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i looked at the floor just under the corner of my bed . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll go see him now . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you . \\n▁ and call me as soon as you 're done . '' \\n▁ ` ` i will . '' \\n▁ i hung up and stuffed the phone in my pocket as i landed on my hands and knees and lowered my face to the ground , peering under the bed . \\n▁ the book was still there , undiscovered . \\n▁ clearly the maids did n't sweep under here often . \\n▁ i reached in and pulled it out , sitting with my back against the mattress after . \\n▁ there was only one sure - fire way to find a cure for anything , and that was to find the cause . \\n▁ but no matter how many times i studied this book , i never really found anything other than one conclusion about my role as this ordained goddess : i was an open book , and all my secrets were painted in cryptic ink on my body for all to see . \\n▁ none of the marks i 'd read about seemed to be anything more than images that told stories ; each one shaped differently according to what i liked to call its ` genre ' . \\n▁ i knew there were marks that could cause the bearer damage , heartache , all kinds of things , but none of these fit that category . \\n▁ not even this so - called mark of betrayal . \\n▁ far as i knew , it was harmless . \\n▁ i flipped through the pages again , taking mental notes , and when i came to the page xxunk showed me , stopped and ran my hand over it . \\n▁ there was only the one english translation , and i had n't yet learned enough words of the ancient language to decipher anything other than what i already knew . \\n▁ but i knew a few people who could . \\n▁ only problem was , that would mean involving other people . \\n▁ i lifted my top and checked the mark . \\n▁ just like the drawing in front of me , it was snakelike , wrapping my waist and hip from my rib to the soft patch of skin just above my pubic bone . \\n▁ it was red , raised , itchy , and black on top , like an incomplete tattoo . \\n▁ ` ` betrayal . '' \\n▁ i read the word aloud , smudging the ink slightly with my fingertip . \\n▁ i had n't done anything that would betray anyone , as far as i knew , unless mother nature considered falling off the lighthouse a betrayal . \\n▁ i closed the book , shrugging . \\n▁ maybe she did . \\n▁ maybe , in her opinion , being careless enough to be on a lighthouse and fall in the first place was betrayal . \\n▁ who knew ? \\n▁ the only solid conclusion i had was that i 'd done something to betray someone or something and , as an xxunk , i could n't hide from it - like every secret thought or act that betrayed my crown would be catalogued physically . \\n▁ and that thought made me look up , even though the answer was n't above my sliding glass door . \\n▁ but something in my own words clicked : betrayal to the crown . \\n▁ there were things i could do as queen , decisions i could make to my own free will , provided i always had the peoples ' best interests in mind . \\n▁ so maybe that was it . \\n▁ maybe i 'd made some decision , committed some act that i had n't realised was going against my crown . \\n▁ if i could figure that out and put it right , maybe i could get rid of this mark myself . \\n▁ but , to figure it out , i 'd have to think carefully back to everything i did the day i fell off that lighthouse , and check that against my notes on the laws of the lilithian reign , and maybe even against some of the known laws of nature . \\n▁ i snapped the book shut and stood up . \\n▁ i had a lot of study to do . \\n▁ the flames burned low in the open fire across from me , their golden glow flickering against my hands and my books , lighting the words on the page . \\n▁ i could see now why arthur lit the fire when he came here to read at night . \\n▁ it really was quite a lonely place , but not so desolate with those sparkling embers , and the smoky smell of burning wood kind of ` took me home ' in a sense . \\n▁ i sat down with another book in hand to cross reference , but the lure of jase 's diary was calling me in a voice louder than the one seeking the answer about my mark . \\n▁ ` ` okay , okay . \\n▁ just a little look , '' i said to myself and shoved the giant book of shadows aside , its dusty pages snapping shut like an iron door . \\n▁ jase 's book was small , no bigger than a short novel , with the leather having been bent so many times the spine was wrinkled and looked almost dirty between the cracks . \\n▁ i determined , as i gently unfolded the pages , that it must have been about a hundred years old . \\n▁ and i got a very sudden sense of respect for the wisdom jase must have collected over that time . \\n▁ the first page was titled by its date : 1914 . \\n▁ there were scribbles and lines in the margins - notes taken then corrected , some in different inks , as if he 'd come back to this page many times . \\n▁ in fact , all the pages seemed to be in the same condition , and i guessed he 'd experienced signs of his telekinesis long before he actually knew what it was . \\n▁ i scrolled down through the curvy text , looking for keywords , since i really did n't have time to sit and study the entire entry . \\n▁ when i spotted the words accidental and david , i narrowed my grid and read that passage : my brother , david , staring back at me . \\n▁ he was n't supposed to be there . \\n▁ i had n't seen him for some months now , and to aim my gun right in his face and almost pull the trigger , well , let 's just say that 's not the happy reunion either of us expected . \\n▁ our meeting was purely accidental , coincidental , who knows ? \\n▁ but i was mighty glad to see the guy . \\n▁ for a while , i thought he was dead . \\n▁ i know that 's not possible , but i worried anyhow . \\n▁ ` ` this must have been from the war , '' i whispered to myself , so awed by it that myself turned the page . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i slapped my own wrist and closed the book . \\n▁ ` ` stay on track . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , okay , '' i replied and slid the giant book of shadows in front of me again , using a bit of might to pry it open and a bit of skill to stop the heavy pages on the right from flipping over and covering what i was reading on the left : the title page . \\n▁ just the same as human parents once did in their family bibles , the names of each child in this witch 's bloodline had been scribed on the first page , a sort of naming ritual . \\n▁ and there , at the bottom , right under xxunk xxunk , was morgana . \\n▁ i held my breath . \\n▁ she was real . \\n▁ and this could be living proof that she at least grew old enough to read . \\n▁ perhaps this book was passed down to her . \\n▁ perhaps she knew all the spells by heart . \\n▁ maybe she was wondering what ever happened to the book . \\n▁ as i went to turn the page - take a little xxunk at some spells - a certain combination of letters in a very unusual name stood out at me from the list : anandene . \\n▁ ` ` anandene ? '' \\n▁ my nose crinkled . \\n▁ anandene and morgana were related ? \\n▁ there were no lines connecting the names . \\n▁ none that even connected xxunk to morgana , so there was no way to know if anandene had been directly or distantly related to morgana . \\n▁ the names were simply listed like required ingredients in a fancy dish . \\n▁ typical . \\n▁ i 'd opened this stupid book to find answers , and all it had done was create another bloody mystery . \\n▁ i dropped my head into my hands . \\n▁ as if i needed any more mysteries right now . \\n▁ ` ` ooh , what spell are we doing ? '' \\n▁ eve said , sitting on the desk beside the book - her legs crossed like a lady , an eager grin on her dead face . \\n▁ ` ` we are not doing any spells . '' \\n▁ i gently turned a few pages until they balanced equally on each side . \\n▁ ` ` i was hoping to find something that might get rid of unwanted ink . '' \\n▁ ` ` try the back of the book , '' she muttered in a hateful huff and vanished . \\n▁ i scowled at the empty space . \\n▁ ` ` thanks for your help . '' \\n▁ as the coals in the fireplace burned to embers and the early morning chill of an approaching autumn settled around my nose and ears , i flipped past hundreds of spells that healed broken or sick things , potions mixed for ailments and hopes , and when i came to the end of the book , found a stack of notes and spells stuffed in between the last page and the hard cover . \\n▁ one was a love spell . \\n▁ i tossed it aside . \\n▁ did not need that . \\n▁ one was a sleeping spell . \\n▁ i tucked that into my pocket for the next time i needed an easy escape . \\n▁ but the last one i unfolded was written in another language , the page so thin and delicate i was n't sure it was actually ever paper . \\n▁ i laid it beside a sheet parchment and scribbled down the symbols and words exactly , copying the pictures and the diagrams , then stuffed it all back in the book and closed it . \\n▁ i was n't sure what the spell did , but i knew of some translation books that could help me figure it out . \\n▁ and , also , i had jason . \\n▁ he could read that language as well as arthur could . \\n▁ i knew he 'd help if i asked . \\n▁ ` ` the aide - xxunk de xxunk , an encyclopaedia of lilithian law , and several books on magic , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` what could our young queen be searching for ? '' \\n▁ ` ` arthur ? '' \\n▁ i gasped , flipping the books closed and most certainly losing my pages . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing up so late ? '' \\n▁ he pulled out a chair beside me and sat down , moving a few books upward to make room for his elbow . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not much of a sleeper . '' \\n▁ i felt the weight of being sprung bare down on me , making my whole face go hot . \\n▁ my fingers wrung the hem of my dress tightly and my eyes would n't shift from the books . \\n▁ i needed to come up with an excuse for having these titles checked out , but i could n't think of one . \\n▁ ` ` i - '' ` ` you do n't have to explain anything to me , princess . '' \\n▁ he reached across and patted my hand . \\n▁ ` ` i was just teasing , but , '' he said as he stood up . \\n▁ ` ` if you need help with anything , you know you can come to me , right ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , keeping my eyes on the books . \\n▁ ` ` very well . '' \\n▁ i saw him bow his head once in my peripheral . \\n▁ ` ` i shall leave you to it . \\n▁ just do n't stay up too much longer . '' \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't , '' i said , then spun in my chair to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` arthur ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , my dear . '' \\n▁ i took a deep breath , still considering my words . \\n▁ ` ` i … i have a rash . '' \\n▁ his eyes squared off a bit under a furrowed brow . \\n▁ ` ` what kind of rash ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um , this kind . '' \\n▁ i stood up and lifted my top . \\n▁ ` ` i already know it 's a mark of betrayal , '' i said , and arthur 's eyes met mine . \\n▁ ` ` i just ca n't … '' i motioned to the books behind me . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't figure out why . '' \\n▁ he looked away , slowly exhaling . \\n▁ ` ` i may know why . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i stepped closer . \\n▁ ` ` what have i done ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's … '' he seemed to be considering his words very carefully , looking from the books to me , and back again . \\n▁ ` ` eventually , you will figure it out . \\n▁ eventually , it will not be a secret i can keep but , for now - '' he bowed once . \\n▁ ` ` i must ask you not to seek the answer . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i fear the truth could bring you more harm than a little rash on your flesh . '' \\n▁ i opened my mouth to protest , but took a second and let the words simmer through me instead , considering them , taking them for every ounce of meaning i could hear in his undertone and thinking long and hard in that second whether or not i wanted to challenge him . \\n▁ ` ` okay , so , maybe do n't tell me the truth right now , but at least tell me how it could bring me harm . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're going to lose your husband in a few short months , amara . \\n▁ any time you have with him is precious , and any memories you have from your past should only be happy ones . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what 's that got to do with my rash ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that fact that it has anything to do with your rash is exactly why you should leave it alone . \\n▁ and i ' ve told david the same . '' \\n▁ ` ` what does he know about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he knows it 's not a rash , my dear . \\n▁ he was n't born yesterday . '' \\n▁ ` ` but he does n't know what kind of mark it is , does he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ which is why he 's been looking for that book . '' \\n▁ he nodded to the table . \\n▁ ` ` the journal of the xxunk ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and you must keep it from him at all costs , amara . '' \\n▁ he used a tone of ` grave warning ' , but it only made me laugh . \\n▁ he might have known the full weight of what he said but , to me , i could n't piece anything together based on that statement , and it just was n't going to be enough to quash my curiosity - not for this version of me , anyway . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't understand . '' \\n▁ ` ` the truth he will find in that journal will be too much for him to bear . '' \\n▁ ` ` what if we want the truth , even if it has something to do with destroying happy memories ? '' \\n▁ ` ` then , i guess you have a lot of reading to do , my dear . '' \\n▁ he nodded to my books then turned on his heel . \\n▁ ` ` because you 'll not be hearing it from me . '' \\n▁ i huffed , dropping my hands to my hips as arthur walked away . \\n▁ ` ` how rude . '' \\n▁ ` ` he means well , '' eve said , suddenly beside me . \\n▁ ` ` he just does n't want to be the one that hurts you . '' \\n▁ ` ` hurts me ? '' \\n▁ i looked sideways at her then back at the empty library . \\n▁ ` ` how would he hurt me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when you figure out the puzzle , you 'll understand why . '' \\n▁ ` ` puzzle . \\n▁ what puzzle ? '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` and , hey , why did you push me out the window the other day ? '' \\n▁ she smiled , her young face looking innocent . \\n▁ ` ` to free your soul . '' \\n▁ ` ` free my … ? \\n▁ how would that free my soul ? \\n▁ eve ? '' \\n▁ i called , circling on the spot a few times , but the ghost was gone . \\n▁ i always loved the manor kitchen , with its warm , country feel , wood counter tops crowning rustic - looking cupboards , and a giant old dining table that centred the space - its washed , fading green colour stylishly unmatched by the white chairs pushed in under it . \\n▁ the whole room had that ` grandmother 's kitchen ' kind of feel , with a collection of herbs and spices grown fresh in the garden then hung inside over the windows or the stove , and a pot rack suspended from thick black chains over an island counter . \\n▁ but my favourite thing about this place was that , in the morning , the soft scent of fresh bread , toasted slowly over an open flame , would accompany the rich aroma of italian roast , drawing me gently awake the closer i got . \\n▁ i wandered in and sat down , swinging my legs under the table as the carbon copy of mike placed a mug and a pitcher of cream in front of me . \\n▁ ` ` hey , falcon . '' \\n▁ ` ` morning , my queen . \\n▁ sleep well ? '' \\n▁ ` ` knowing i had quaid outside my door all night ? '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ he sat down . \\n▁ ` ` i sleep better when i have a guard on you . \\n▁ i just … '' ` ` just ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you know i do n't usually order it every night . \\n▁ but , last night , i had a hunch . '' \\n▁ ` ` a hunch ? '' \\n▁ my brow arched , the scepticism hidden behind my coffee mug as i took a sip . \\n▁ it was no creamy , sugary delight , like david 's coffee , but it was nice to have someone make it for me . \\n▁ ` ` what kind of hunch ? '' \\n▁ he exhaled loudly , swiping his thumb across his bottom lip . \\n▁ ` ` whenever i get those … feelings , you usually end up in some kind of trouble . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i did n't last night . '' \\n▁ i flashed a cheesy grin , cocking my head like an innocent puppy . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ but we did pick up a suspicious scent around the border of the manor this morning . \\n▁ whoever it was , they may have been on their way to see you . '' \\n▁ ` ` ooh , creepy . '' \\n▁ i dusted myself off jokingly . \\n▁ ` ` anyway , i was n't in my room for most of last night . \\n▁ i was reading in the library . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he sipped his coffee . \\n▁ ` ` what were you looking for ? \\n▁ anything i can help with ? '' \\n▁ ` ` hopefully . \\n▁ that 's why i asked you here this morning . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , so what is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i need to show you something , '' i said , feeling a little awkward . \\n▁ he sat back , folding his arms as if waiting for me to tell him i 'd gotten myself into some kind of mess . \\n▁ ` ` need to show me what , exactly ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's nothing bad . \\n▁ i mean , i hope . '' \\n▁ i stood and lifted my shirt , scooping my jeans down an inch to show where the black rash snuck down below my pubic line . \\n▁ ` ` the mark of betrayal , '' he said , clearing his throat after . \\n▁ ` ` you know what it is ? '' \\n▁ i twisted at the waist a little to look all the way around at the back of my hip . \\n▁ ` ` i happen to have extensively studied anything to do with you , your body , your past , and your bloodline , ara . \\n▁ of course i know what it is . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve studied me ? '' \\n▁ i lowered my top and pulled my jeans up again . \\n▁ ` ` your majesty , i am head of the queen 's guard . \\n▁ that role comes with certain expectations . '' \\n▁ he walked over to the sink and dumped his cup in there . \\n▁ ` ` i should be the number - one most educated man in this manor when it comes to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , how do you know what kind of mark it is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it wraps your torso from your heart to your hip - it 's the only mark of its kind . \\n▁ and the question is , ara - '' he propped one foot on the seat of the chair , resting his arm over his knee . \\n▁ ` ` what have you done ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i leaned my butt on the tabletop . \\n▁ ` ` i was hoping maybe if i could figure out what kinds of things would give me this mark , then maybe i could - '' ` ` ara , what ever it is you ' ve done , to be marked with that symbol , it has to have been something pretty spectacular . '' \\n▁ he dropped his foot to the floor , standing tall again . \\n▁ ` ` that 's one of the four xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` the what now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` there are four things a queen can do that ultimately betray her crown , her people or herself . \\n▁ you do n't need to figure out so much what it is you did , but perhaps whom you did it to . \\n▁ and there should be a symbol somewhere in that mess of a rash all over you that reveals it . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , which one . '' \\n▁ i lifted my top and poked at the black line . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ he put my top down for me . \\n▁ ` ` and stop doing that . \\n▁ if anyone walks past , they 'll think we 're being inappropriate . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ sorry , falcon . \\n▁ that was n't my intention . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ just … '' his eyes drifted away from me . \\n▁ ` ` just be more careful . '' \\n▁ ` ` sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` stop saying sorry . '' \\n▁ he pulled the chair out and sat down , offering me my seat again . \\n▁ ` ` how long have you had the mark , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it started as a red rash after i fell off the lighthouse , and it 's just been changing since then . '' \\n▁ ` ` the lighthouse ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you jump ? '' \\n▁ he asked , and silence befell the room . \\n▁ ` ` i - '' my mouth opened , but i was so shocked by the question i struggled to form an answer . \\n▁ ` ` no way . \\n▁ i 'd never do something like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you sure ? \\n▁ maybe you were so depressed about david being away that you - '' ` ` no ! \\n▁ falcon , that 's ludicrous . '' \\n▁ i jumped up and walked over to the sink . \\n▁ ` ` it would take a lot more than that to make me want to die . '' \\n▁ ` ` bingo . '' \\n▁ he appeared beside me . \\n▁ ` ` then , what did you do before you ended up on the lighthouse that night ? '' \\n▁ my immediate reaction was to protest . \\n▁ but i stopped . \\n▁ what if something really bad had happened , and i did actually jump ? \\n▁ i mean , david was there that night . \\n▁ what if he and i had an argument - what if he told me the truth about going to his death , and that 's why i jumped , knowing i did n't want to live without him ? \\n▁ it would make sense . \\n▁ it would explain why he was so hell - bent on keeping the truth from me . \\n▁ or maybe it was n't that at all . \\n▁ maybe , just like my gut had been trying to tell me , it had something to do with jason . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't think of anything that would be bad enough to make me want to die , can you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` damned if i know , ara . '' \\n▁ he shrugged , stepping away . \\n▁ ` ` unfortunately , there are no books i can study that get inside your head . '' \\n▁ ` ` but someone can . '' \\n▁ a suggestive grin teased my lips . \\n▁ ` ` someone can get in my head and go back to that night - see what happened . '' \\n▁ he settled back on his heels . \\n▁ ` ` jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ maybe i could ask him to , i dunno , xxunk me and take me back on a past - month regression ? '' \\n▁ ` ` bad idea , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because , a : he 's not allowed near you , especially when the king is absent . \\n▁ and , b : until we know exactly what happened and whether or not you did , in fact , jump , every person in this manor is guilty until proven innocent . \\n▁ including david , '' he added . \\n▁ ` ` why david ? \\n▁ he 'd never hurt me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know that . \\n▁ and neither do you , really . \\n▁ he 's pretty vial , ara , especially when it comes to the law . \\n▁ for all we know , he pushed you off the lighthouse . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would he push me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` who knows ? \\n▁ all i know is that he was out there that night , and it 's a pretty convenient story that he just happened to return here to ` ` talk '' with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but - '' ` ` but nothing . \\n▁ it 's my job to protect you , your majesty , even if that means from the king . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's exactly why i should go to jason , and - '' ` ` and how do you know it was n't him ? '' \\n▁ he let that hang for a second . \\n▁ ` ` he was the last one to see you that night , ara . \\n▁ not to mention , your memory is gone . \\n▁ how do we know he did n't erase it ? '' \\n▁ i rubbed my head . \\n▁ ` ` so we tell no one ? '' \\n▁ ` ` look , let me take a good look at the book of marks , and another good look at your body - in private . '' \\n▁ he looked around as if someone might have heard him say that . \\n▁ ` ` and if we ca n't come up with an answer , then we 'll discuss further investigation , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ and just until we ' ve figured this out , i want guards on you at night . '' \\n▁ i took a deep breath and let it out . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ if that eases your mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` it will . '' \\n▁ he nodded once . \\n▁ ` ` and , thank you , falcon - for helping me out with this . '' \\n▁ i motioned to my mark . \\n▁ ` ` it 's always my pleasure , majesty , and i know i do n't need to say it , but … you can trust this information will go no further than me . '' \\n▁ ` ` not to mike ? '' \\n▁ he held back a small laugh . \\n▁ ` ` especially not to mike . '' \\n▁ chapter eight ` ` you wanted to see me ? '' \\n▁ i said , popping my head around jason 's door . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , come in . '' \\n▁ his arm rose in a wave from his huddle over the spread of papers in front of him . \\n▁ i stopped a second to look back at falcon . \\n▁ ` ` coming , fal ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ he gave a small nod of approval . \\n▁ ` ` i can hear everything from out here . '' \\n▁ i flashed him a grin and closed jason 's door behind me , shutting us into his room , alone . \\n▁ ` ` what 's up , jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know why the stone melted . \\n▁ but that was n't why i asked you here . '' \\n▁ he leaned his butt against the table and folded his arms . \\n▁ ` ` you were thinking about something at breakfast . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m always thinking about something . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but this thought involved me . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i wondered over and sat on the blanket box at the foot of his bed . \\n▁ ` ` what thought was it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you have something you want me to translate into english . '' \\n▁ my fingertips slowly moved to my hip pocket . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he held his hand out . \\n▁ ` ` show me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i have no idea what kind of spell it is - or if it even is a spell , '' i said , passing him the page i found last night . \\n▁ he considered it for a second . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a junction xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it creates pathways over the dead . '' \\n▁ he turned around and laid it on the desk , grabbing another sheet of paper and a pen . \\n▁ ` ` the dead ? \\n▁ do you mean , like - '' ` ` like brings dead things back to life , if the body is n't damaged . \\n▁ but it 's not black magic , '' he added quickly . \\n▁ ` ` it 's simply a kind of highway , you might say , that guides a soul from one realm to another and puts it where you want it . '' \\n▁ ` ` realm ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ think of it as if we live in layers . '' \\n▁ he laid one hand over the other in the air . \\n▁ ` ` up top , we have the spirit realm , and below , we have the mortal realm . '' \\n▁ ` ` and this spell makes a path for a person to cross sides ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to cross back , yeah . \\n▁ unless its body had no head , or something like that . '' \\n▁ he leaned over the page again and started taking notes . \\n▁ i watched the symbols on one page turn to english on the other under his pen tip , picturing the actions of the spell in my head . \\n▁ ` ` there 's something else , '' jason said without looking up , and i stared at him , waiting , but he did n't elaborate . \\n▁ ` ` what 's something else ? '' \\n▁ he stopped writing with a rather expressive full stop and dumped his pen down . \\n▁ ` ` this rash . '' \\n▁ ` ` what about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` show it to me . '' \\n▁ he looked at my waist . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it 's not what you think it is , and i want to see how much it 's changed . '' \\n▁ i reluctantly inched my shirt up my ribs and drew my tummy in a bit as his warm hands cupped my waist . \\n▁ he knelt down in front of me , his tepid breath calling the tiny hairs above my jeans to attention , and spun me this way and that , frowning , tracing lines over the black rash . \\n▁ ` ` i know you ' ve already decided it 's a mark of betrayal , but it 's not because you ' ve done anything wrong , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` then what 's it from ? '' \\n▁ i pulled my top down as jason stood up again . \\n▁ he propped his shoulder on the tall bedpost , his legs leaned out long , arms folded , making me feel small under his penetrating gaze . \\n▁ ` ` it 's betrayal of the heart . '' \\n▁ ` ` of the heart ? '' \\n▁ i touched my chest absently . \\n▁ ` ` in what way ? '' \\n▁ he just shrugged , lowering his face to hide that sheepish grin . \\n▁ ` ` oh , right . \\n▁ you think i love you , huh ? '' \\n▁ i said jokingly . \\n▁ but he just shrugged again . \\n▁ ` ` maybe . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase - '' ` ` look . \\n▁ just do n't , okay . '' \\n▁ he raised both palms . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't bring you here to argue about your feelings , ara . \\n▁ i just wanted you to stop trying to figure out what you did wrong . '' \\n▁ his arms fell to his sides . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve done nothing wrong . '' \\n▁ i walked a little closer , my eyes narrowing with curiosity , and stopped right in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` i think i know what it is . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ he asked , his eyes a little wider than normal . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ i had to tell him . \\n▁ i had to tell someone what happened between arthur and i in the training room that night - the night i fell of the lighthouse . \\n▁ or jumped . \\n▁ ` ` i already know , ara . \\n▁ and that has nothing to do with the mark . '' \\n▁ ` ` you already know what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know about my uncle and the training hall , and the … turkey xxunk plan you came up with after . '' \\n▁ invisible lava coated my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ he glanced back at his bed and reversed a few steps to sit on it . \\n▁ ` ` i found you that night . \\n▁ you were … mike was there , too . \\n▁ he was towering over you , yelling at you , and i - '' ` ` you what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i punched him in the face and took you up to bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ! \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he went down there to drop some cuffs off , and he found you half naked on the floor , wearing only arthur 's shirt . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` so he 's known ? \\n▁ this entire time , he knew what i planned to do with - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he looked up from the floor . \\n▁ ` ` i erased everything about arthur from his mind the next day . \\n▁ and then i erased yours , took everything from the moment he walked into the training hall that night . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` two reasons . '' \\n▁ ` ` one ? '' \\n▁ i prompted . \\n▁ ` ` one : you were distressed about it all - about mike knowing . \\n▁ and , two : he would have told david about this plan you and arthur had . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you stopped him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but not just because david would freak out . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because mike … '' ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he was irate , ara . \\n▁ he got scared . \\n▁ he thought you 'd actually slept with arthur - that david would hate you now . \\n▁ and all he could think about was the pieces of you he had to pick up last time david left . \\n▁ he just did n't want to see you like that again . \\n▁ and … '' his lips folded into a thin line . \\n▁ ` ` he overreacted . \\n▁ he slapped you . '' \\n▁ ` ` slapped me ? '' \\n▁ my neck jutted outward like a jumper on a skyscraper . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ it was just a shitty situation , ara . \\n▁ i was mad with him at first but … i understand what he was going through then . '' \\n▁ ` ` delusions of grandeur ? '' \\n▁ jase laughed . \\n▁ ` ` probably . \\n▁ all that aside , though , he was packing his bag the next morning , about to quit and go back to australia . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . '' \\n▁ ` ` i knew you still needed him , so … '' he continued . \\n▁ ` ` i erased it from his mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` and then i jumped off the lighthouse ? '' \\n▁ he looked up at me curiously . \\n▁ ` ` what makes you think you jumped ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` just a hunch . '' \\n▁ ` ` hunch , huh ? '' \\n▁ he sighed , both hands going to his head as he flopped back on his bed . \\n▁ ` ` you know why i jumped , do n't you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i may . '' \\n▁ ` ` then … '' i walked over and sat down beside his leg . \\n▁ ` ` tell me . '' \\n▁ he opened one eye and looked out from behind his hands . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it 's better left buried , ara . \\n▁ believe me . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he sat up again , coming to stop with my hand in his . \\n▁ ` ` you trust me , right ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and you know that - '' he squeezed my hand . \\n▁ ` ` i always have your best interests at heart ? '' \\n▁ ` ` uh - huh . '' \\n▁ i nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` then , can you wait ? \\n▁ please . \\n▁ ask me to tell you another time , maybe when david 's gone . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ is it because of what happened with arthur ? '' \\n▁ he tensed , wincing . \\n▁ ` ` kind of . \\n▁ but not really . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase . '' \\n▁ i laid my other hand over his . \\n▁ ` ` you know i ca n't just let this go . \\n▁ you 'd be better off telling me the truth now - save me all the investigation and worry . '' \\n▁ he laughed , his lovely white teeth making me a little hungry for the bite . \\n▁ ` ` i want what 's best for you , ara . \\n▁ we all do . \\n▁ but if i tell you what happened that night , it 'll make you hate yourself . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , if i want to berate myself for something i did , that 's my prerogative , jase . \\n▁ not yours . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . '' \\n▁ he nodded , his distracted gaze moving toward his window . \\n▁ ` ` and i will tell you . \\n▁ but not today . '' \\n▁ ` ` hmpf ! '' \\n▁ i mashed my features together in a scowl . \\n▁ ` ` you 're starting to sound like david . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ that 's the last thing i want to say to you , ara , but i have to protect you . \\n▁ and you know i always tell you the truth , but this time , i - '' ` ` you 're between a rock and hard place . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he exhaled through a smile . \\n▁ ` ` i just need your understanding on this one , just for now . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ but you ' ve got two weeks , and that 's it . \\n▁ then , you better tell me what the hell happened that night . \\n▁ fair ? '' \\n▁ ` ` very fair . '' \\n▁ ` ` pinkie promise . '' \\n▁ he laid his pinkie over mine and shook once . \\n▁ ` ` i promise . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ now , what was this conclusion you drew about my melting stone problem ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ah . '' \\n▁ he stood up quickly . \\n▁ ` ` so , i was right about the lightning theory - the xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` you were . '' \\n▁ i stood beside him at the table . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ you really did n't wan na kiss me , did you ? '' \\n▁ he turned to me , smiling . \\n▁ ` ` um . \\n▁ kinda not really . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ he lifted my chin , green eyes meeting blue in a world of acceptance . \\n▁ ` ` but , that fear - for whatever reason you did n't want to kiss me , ignited your fight instinct in the method of which you ' ve been practicing most , but when your hand heated up , the temperature acted to reverse the process of making rock , you might say , by turning it back to its original state . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ and … did you get a headache when you used your light ? '' \\n▁ he asked , wearing a huge i - know - what - i ' m - talking - about grin . \\n▁ ` ` um . \\n▁ now i think of it . '' \\n▁ i touched my head . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ he grabbed a stack of papers and started writing . \\n▁ ` ` that just confirms my theory . '' \\n▁ ` ` what does ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you got scared , focused your concerns too much on the rock . \\n▁ you made it the problem , so , your electric energy rose up to protect you . \\n▁ your skin melted , you felt the pain , thought i was causing it , and broke my arm to stop me . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i gathered that much . '' \\n▁ ` ` right , but … '' he tapped the page once with his pen . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't believe your blue light thing is actually meant to be used as a weapon . '' \\n▁ ` ` what else would it be for ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not sure . '' \\n▁ he rubbed his brow . \\n▁ ` ` i need to think . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i took a step back . \\n▁ ` ` shall i come back later ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i 'll come see you at training . \\n▁ tell blade i 'll be there : he can get the others to back off . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i looked at the door then back at jase . \\n▁ ` ` so this is what the crazy scientist part of you looks like ? '' \\n▁ he stopped writing and slowly looked up , turning his gaze on me a second later . \\n▁ ` ` sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ i held both hands up . \\n▁ ` ` go ahead and xxunk . \\n▁ if you can figure out how to make me melt stone again , that 'd - '' ` ` i ' m more worried about your headaches , right now , sweet girl , '' he said , and turned away to scribble things down . \\n▁ ` ` if you wan na melt stone again , just go sit on the beach with one in your hand , ara , and think back to how you felt the other day . \\n▁ reliving the same emotions should give you the ability to recreate the scenario . \\n▁ just - '' he stopped and held up his arm , sporting a smart grin . \\n▁ ` ` do it alone . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ maybe i 'll go out there after training today , if i have time . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he went back to his pages . \\n▁ ` ` and , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm ? '' \\n▁ i stopped by the open door . \\n▁ ` ` do n't forget this . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i skipped over and took the translated spell from him . \\n▁ ` ` thanks . '' \\n▁ ` ` any time , '' he said , without even looking up . \\n▁ the training hall was empty , except for the lone knight in the corner , taking out what looked like a year 's worth of fury on the punching bag . \\n▁ his arms were tight , the muscles lean and long , covered in a thin layer of perspiration , which i gathered was n't so much from the punching but from the restraint he was using not to break that bag . \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ he looked up and wiped his wrist over his chin , then hit the bag again . \\n▁ ` ` you 're early . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i uh - '' i looked out the windows to see if anyone else was coming . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted to talk to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what about ? '' \\n▁ i stopped with both hands on the weighted bag to steady it . \\n▁ ` ` you okay , mike ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he gave it another hit , the sheer force absorbed by my buckling knees . \\n▁ ` ` just girl troubles . '' \\n▁ ` ` girl troubles ? '' \\n▁ there was something odd about the way he looked at me then , as if maybe he thought i already knew - or should know . \\n▁ ` ` what 'd you want , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um . '' \\n▁ i wiped my hands on my jeans . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember the night i fell off the lighthouse ? '' \\n▁ he frowned at me , then turned to the bench behind him and grabbed a towel , disappearing under it for a second . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if i tell you something , will you promise not to investigate further until i say so ? '' \\n▁ his scruffy hair stuck up from out of the towel first , followed by his wide caramel eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i make no guarantees . '' \\n▁ ` ` i thought you 'd say that . '' \\n▁ i spun on my heel and headed for the door . \\n▁ ` ` wait , '' he called , grabbing my arm . \\n▁ ` ` just … what do you know , ara ? \\n▁ if it 's something that puts you in danger , i ca n't - '' ` ` it does n't . \\n▁ but i ' ve heard from two people so far that if i know the full story , it could lead to some problems between david and i. '' ` ` see ? \\n▁ now , that 's concern enough right there . '' \\n▁ he flopped the towel over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but you either agree to my terms , or i walk . '' \\n▁ he repositioned the towel . \\n▁ ` ` what terms ? '' \\n▁ ` ` promise me you wo n't rough up my source . '' \\n▁ he rocked back on his heels , his lip curling in disgust . \\n▁ ` ` your source is jason , is n't it ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ i could see mike was in a tough spot here . \\n▁ he knew i would n't come to him unless the information i had was good , but he also knew i would n't share one shred of it if i thought jason might get hurt . \\n▁ ` ` fine , '' he rescinded . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't torture the little shit for information . \\n▁ now , what d'you wan na tell me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you hit me . '' \\n▁ his brow folded , but then he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` seriously , mike . \\n▁ you hit me because you thought i slept with arthur . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ he coughed . \\n▁ ` ` ara , that 's … i 'd remember thinking something like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` precisely . '' \\n▁ i smirked . \\n▁ his arms fell heavily to his sides . \\n▁ ` ` nob - head erased it . '' \\n▁ ` ` jason , yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's why i do n't remember coming down here the night you fell . '' \\n▁ he looked over to the weapons shelf where the cuffs sat - all lined up like shining reminders . \\n▁ ` ` so , what , you were down here , and i. . . ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you could smell arthur had been here , too . '' \\n▁ ` ` what were you doing here with him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` talking . \\n▁ where no one could hear - '' ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he cut in before i could finish . \\n▁ ` ` we were trying to find a way to save david . '' \\n▁ ` ` from what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` using the dagger to kill drake - '' ` ` you knew about it then ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and i did n't have sex with arthur , mike , '' i promised . \\n▁ ` ` except … '' ` ` i would n't listen , '' he said with a nod . \\n▁ ` ` and i. . . '' \\n▁ ` ` you slapped me . '' \\n▁ he looked at my face for a long moment , his eyes going smaller with thought . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd never do that , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ jason said he found you the next day , packing to leave because of it . \\n▁ he knew i needed you here , so he erased it . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you believe him ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ mike 's hands went into his hair . \\n▁ he walked backward until he found the bench , then sat down . \\n▁ ` ` ara , i ' m - '' ` ` it 's okay , mike . '' \\n▁ i appeared beside him . \\n▁ ` ` you were stressed and worried . \\n▁ i get that . \\n▁ but i know you . \\n▁ i mean , i do n't have any memory of you coming down here , only my talk with arthur beforehand , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` but i know you would n't have hurt me . \\n▁ it was probably a pathetic little tap . '' \\n▁ ` ` that does n't make it okay , ar . '' \\n▁ he stood up again , slipping a shirt over his head and down his ribs . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m the chief of security - the one person in the world who is trusted to protect you , and i … i hit you ? '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed as he muttered the last words in stunned disbelief . \\n▁ ` ` aw , mike ? '' \\n▁ i stood up . \\n▁ ` ` maybe i should n't have told you . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he opened himself up for a hug . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad you did , ara . \\n▁ it 's … i should know . '' \\n▁ i fell into his sweaty embrace . \\n▁ ` ` if it means anything , mike , i forgive you . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw . '' \\n▁ he kissed my head firmly . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a good girl , ara . \\n▁ but , i. . . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you ended up falling off a lighthouse after that . \\n▁ are you sure i did n't - '' ` ` you did n't throw me off it , mike . \\n▁ you went up to your room , and jason took me back to bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` then … does he know how you ended up out there that night ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i think arthur knows something , too . \\n▁ but … '' ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , falcon and i have been doing some research , and - '' ` ` falcon ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` he 's my go - to guy . '' \\n▁ mike half frowned , half smiled . \\n▁ i could tell he was as pleased as he was shocked . \\n▁ ` ` anyway , '' i continued , ` ` we think maybe i xxunk - '' ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ falcon swept into the room , flanked by blade and quaid , the three of them making an awful lot of racket - certainly enough to drown out anything i might have said . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , guys ? '' \\n▁ mike flashed them a toothy grin , turning his head to whisper , ` ` we 'll talk later , '' under his breath . \\n▁ i nodded , patting his arm , and mike skipped off into the mix as if the guys had n't just tried to silence me . \\n▁ however , i was not so willing to play nice . \\n▁ instead , i marched straight up to falcon at full speed , grabbed his giant arm and hauled him outside . \\n▁ ` ` what was that all about ? '' \\n▁ he leaned down a little so the general distance from his mouth to my ear would n't factor out discretion . \\n▁ ` ` if you tell him you jumped , you can forget living , ara . \\n▁ he 'll cover you with guards twenty - four - seven , and he 'll call david home . '' \\n▁ ` ` he has a right to know , falcon . \\n▁ how can he protect me if he does n't know what 's going on ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's not the one protecting you right now . \\n▁ i am . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's my friend . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but when it comes to your safety , that is the very thing clouding his vision . \\n▁ i still do n't know why you jumped or if it might ' ve had something to do with david , so i do n't want the king back here until we ' ve had a chance to figure it out . '' \\n▁ we stepped apart as a group of knights walked between us and into the hall , both of us staying quiet until they were well and truly inside and the only noise out here was the gentle summer breeze and the chirping of birds in the trees . \\n▁ ` ` mike knows you butted in deliberately then , fal . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and i 'll tell him it 's because you were about to say something i did n't want quaid and blade to overhear . '' \\n▁ i looked at the three of them in the centre of the training hall , laughing loudly like they were trying to hear their own voices over a storm . \\n▁ ` ` they know , do n't they - blade and quaid ? '' \\n▁ falcon nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i briefed them . '' \\n▁ i folded my arms in , watching the man across the room that i was once so close to - the man i could trust with anything . \\n▁ ` ` it 's so wrong that you 're leaving mike out of the loop , falcon . '' \\n▁ he looked at mike , too . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but he 's too close to you , ara . \\n▁ i believe this is best - and i ' ve got ten years of special forces training to back my claim . '' \\n▁ ` ` special forces , huh ? '' \\n▁ i elbowed him softly . \\n▁ ` ` come on . '' \\n▁ he winked , leading me away with a gentle hand to my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` let 's finish up with training for today , then we 'll go to the library and put in a few more hours ' research on the mark . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , '' i said glumly . \\n▁ ` ` if i ' m not crippled with a headache after . '' \\n▁ ` ` something tells me you 'll be fine . '' \\n▁ i frowned up at his grin . \\n▁ ` ` what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ mike cut in , jogging over . \\n▁ ` ` you 're up first today . \\n▁ we 're gon na do weapons training after dinner instead . \\n▁ i need to make a report on your blue light for david . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he asked about it - said his reasons were on a ` ` need to know '' basis . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you do n't need to know ? '' \\n▁ i asked , winking at him . \\n▁ ` ` guess not . '' \\n▁ he backed away . \\n▁ ` ` i think he 's just worried . \\n▁ he said something happened on the beach the other day . '' \\n▁ he eyed falcon suspiciously , then asked me , ` ` anything you wan na share ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um . '' \\n▁ my gaze flicked to falcon , whose face pretty much said ` do n't you dare ' . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll check with david first . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine with me . \\n▁ so - '' mike clapped his hands loudly and looked around the room . \\n▁ ` ` volunteers ? '' \\n▁ everyone in the room went dead quiet , half of them casting their gaze to the floor - fifty strapping young lads , shirtless and manly , all cowering before a girl half their size . \\n▁ ` ` fine . '' \\n▁ mike rolled his sleeves up . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll do it . '' \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ i started . \\n▁ ` ` you - '' he leaned in and cupped my arm . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m pretty sure i deserve it , ara . '' \\n▁ at first i was confused , until i realised he meant that he deserved the pain for the slap he 'd given me . \\n▁ ` ` fine . '' \\n▁ i grinned , rubbing my hands together . \\n▁ ` ` pay back time . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` then we 're even , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not even close . '' \\n▁ i bared my teeth at him . \\n▁ ` ` but i might consider forgiveness if you make me some of your famous brownies later . '' \\n▁ he shook his head , smiling , and moved to the centre of the room . \\n▁ ` ` clear the space , everyone . '' \\n▁ everyone moved back five paces , giving mike and i plenty of battleground . \\n▁ ` ` where would you like me to fire , mikey ? '' \\n▁ i asked , resting my hands on my knees . \\n▁ ` ` cause , personally , i 'd like to shoot you in the ass . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha ! \\n▁ good luck . '' \\n▁ he turned and offered me a small glimpse of his butt . \\n▁ ` ` this knight is way too quick for - ah ! '' \\n▁ he jolted forward and hit the deck , a rush of blue filling the space around him , as if a glow - worm just farted , retreating back into my fingertips after . \\n▁ the entire room of knights , both vampire and lilithian , broke into burly laugher , and from the corner of my eye , i saw xxunk exchange hands . \\n▁ ` ` where shall i shoot you next ? '' \\n▁ mike stumbled to his feet , rubbing his bottom . \\n▁ ` ` why not aim for the heart ? '' \\n▁ he faced me again . \\n▁ ` ` you did a pretty good job of banging it up last time , maybe you can finish it off . '' \\n▁ the crowd roared , half with laughter , the other half with a very long ` ` xxrep 4 o h . '' \\n▁ ` ` heart sounds great , '' i said , and flicked a bolt of energy toward him , but he ducked to one side and swept under it , charging forward fast before i even realised i had n't hit him . \\n▁ i coughed out as i went down on my back , the ground rattling my spine like an iron hammer on a twig . \\n▁ i was sure i even heard something crack . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ mike leaned back a bit . \\n▁ ` ` sure , '' i said in a squeezed voice , using my pain to distract him , then hooked my ankle up and around his chest , forcing him onto the ground as i rose up to pin him flat with both knees . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine . \\n▁ how are you ? '' \\n▁ he whacked the ground with a flat palm three times , and i eased my kneecap back off his throat . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , too much ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no way . '' \\n▁ he shoved me back on my butt and skittered away . \\n▁ ` ` silly girl . \\n▁ you had me then , were it not for your compassion . '' \\n▁ i got to my feet and stood ready to take him on , but he waved in three more knights from the sidelines , and the odds suddenly changed in their favour . \\n▁ but i had a new weapon up my sleeve , something none of them could fight if i could just figure out how to use it . \\n▁ ` ` to your right , majesty , '' a man called , coming in from my left . \\n▁ i saw him shift before i heard his voice , though , so his attempt to distract me was futile . \\n▁ my fist drove a new path for blood through two bones in his ribs , burning the hole closed with a bolt of blue energy after . \\n▁ he fell to the floor just as knight number two dove into the fray and cupped the side of my face from behind , twisting my neck to the highest point of resistance . \\n▁ i dropped my hand down by my hip and shot him in the balls , logging his screams of horror in my feel - bad - about - it - later thoughts . \\n▁ it was n't over yet . \\n▁ we had fifty more knights in here that 'd willingly take me down . \\n▁ but it was mike 's hands that wrapped my waist . \\n▁ ` ` going for a man 's family jewels , ara . \\n▁ that 's low . \\n▁ even for you , '' he whispered in my ear , then flipped me upside down , dropping me to the floor with one knee on my chest , the other pinning my head by the ponytail . \\n▁ ` ` yield ? '' \\n▁ ` ` never . '' \\n▁ i struggled against him for a second , then pushed a hand into his chest and shot him right through the heart . \\n▁ i smelled the flesh burn , saw it melt as the shock registered in his eyes a second before he flew back . \\n▁ and two knights grabbed me as mike hit the ground , dragging me to my feet . \\n▁ i yanked my arm from one grip and elbowed the guy in the ribs , swinging my wrist up to his jaw with another jolt of energy . \\n▁ he went down hard , but the knight on my right was n't giving in , and the pain in my head slowly grew , strengthening for each shot . \\n▁ this guy was twice my size in both height and weight , and he was a vampire . \\n▁ i had nothing on him physically . \\n▁ but … mentally . \\n▁ i focused hard on his arm , feeling my face and hands go hotter , the pain in my head rippling throughout my jaw and neck . \\n▁ my blue light seemed useless against him - the man wearing it like a christmas tree parades its candles , and the telekinesis was n't working either . \\n▁ i could n't find that place in me that 'd awakened when i broke jase 's arm . \\n▁ maybe it was there , maybe it was afraid to come out again because of how devastated i felt after i hurt jase . \\n▁ but if the power did n't surface , i 'd lose this battle to a vampire and , in turn , probably lose a lot of respect among the core . \\n▁ one of us was going down in the next ten - seconds , though , and it was n't going to be me . \\n▁ i knew this guy 's strategy : he 'd stand there and cop the pain until it got too much for me - until i threw the towel in . \\n▁ but he was hurting , too . \\n▁ that much was clear , and if my energy was at full strength like it had been when i first shot mike , this guy would n't even be standing . \\n▁ but the colour was fading , the light more of a white than a blue . \\n▁ i knew the vampire could take the pain , but i was sure even he had a limit . \\n▁ i brought my hand up to his face and pushed him backward . \\n▁ he fought me for a second , but his weight shifted suddenly and mercifully , and he let go of my arm , stumbling back a few steps . \\n▁ ` ` get back in there , phelps ! '' \\n▁ the knights surrounding us called , barking like dogs on the sidelines . \\n▁ i blocked them all out and sent another jolt at the vampire to finish him . \\n▁ he dodged , though , and the pain in my head intensified , rising up my arm . \\n▁ i screamed , caging my head in my arms as i landed on my knees . \\n▁ i had to get up . \\n▁ i could n't quit now , not when i was this close . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ mike called . \\n▁ i turned my head and saw myself in the reflection of his eyes as they met mine - saw all the fear and amazement he felt inside radiating out of him , right into the deepest part of me . \\n▁ i heard him speak , saw his lips move and even felt him run a finger under my nose , collecting something wet , but the words did n't really register . \\n▁ my electric hold was locked onto the vampire , and he was going down , come hell or high water . \\n▁ ` ` ara , stop , '' mike yelled , pulling my hand down . \\n▁ ` ` look at the floor . '' \\n▁ my eyes drifted away from the lock of an angered gaze at the standing knight , and saw a pool of blood flooding my feet . \\n▁ i wondered how it got there - if someone had been hurt . \\n▁ i wondered why mike had n't called for them to see the nurse . \\n▁ i was about to tell him to do something , tell him to help the person who was bleeding , when mike 's words shot past me in a mighty growl , ` ` what are you doing here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` saving her life , '' jason said . \\n▁ i felt him touch me - felt his hands on me , felt the world move under the swaying in my head , but i did n't see him move me . \\n▁ i did n't see anything until i felt the grass under my fingertips , jason pinning my wrists to the ground , holding them there . \\n▁ ` ` do n't move , '' he demanded , then looked up at the approaching crowd . \\n▁ ` ` everyone stay where they are damn well standing , or her head will explode . '' \\n▁ the earth heated under my hands , like touching a cake fresh from the oven . \\n▁ it smelled like warm clay on a hot summer 's day - the grass giving off a little smoke . \\n▁ mike took one step closer and watched on with his mouth agape as the light from my hands went bright white , melting the sand to mud in the cup of my palm , the liquid rising up my arms and through my veins , assimilating the pain in my head , like warm water over cold toes . \\n▁ my spine eased to relaxed , my neck rising from within the safety of my collar bones , and i rocked back on my knees , resting on my sit - bones beside jason , who held a stern gaze at mike , one finger still aimed in case my beloved bff saw fit to interfere . \\n▁ ` ` what … '' i started , breathless , ` ` just happened ? '' \\n▁ jason laughed . \\n▁ ` ` the pain 's gone ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , that pain 's gone . '' \\n▁ i pressed three fingertips to my temple . \\n▁ ` ` where did it go ? '' \\n▁ he laughed again . \\n▁ ` ` it worked . \\n▁ i ca n't believe it actually worked . '' \\n▁ ` ` what worked ? '' \\n▁ he spun me at the shoulders and held them both tight . \\n▁ ` ` i went through a thousand conclusions : that maybe you were a negative terminal of a battery , and the knights you were shooting were positive , causing a short circuit . \\n▁ then i thought maybe you were what 's known as a ` loose circuit , ' because the energy was n't passing through a load , but that did n't really fit , either . \\n▁ and then i came up with what proved to be right . '' \\n▁ ` ` which is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's nature 's energy . \\n▁ you 're drawing it from the earth , and you can use it , but it needs to go back into the earth after . '' \\n▁ he pushed his dark locks from his face , his smile so radiant you 'd think he was a kid at a circus . \\n▁ ` ` when you use it for that purpose , you 're the negative terminal , the knights the load , and the earth the positive . '' \\n▁ ` ` that does n't make a whole lot of sense to me right now , '' i said with a soft chuckle , ` ` but my head does n't hurt , so i do n't really care . '' \\n▁ he laughed and helped me to my feet . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll show you more about it later . \\n▁ i have an entire report on it , but i got ta write this down before i forget what 's … '' he tapped his head . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a lot going on here . \\n▁ i got ta g - '' ` ` ara ! '' \\n▁ mike pushed in and swathed me like a blanket . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' i said , my lungs restrained by the grip of mike 's loving embrace . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve never seen you fight so hard before , '' he said , sweeping my hair back . \\n▁ ` ` you really were n't gon na give up , were you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what would be the point of it all then , mike ? \\n▁ if i always give up when it gets too hard . '' \\n▁ he pulled me in again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so proud of you . '' \\n▁ ` ` thanks . '' \\n▁ i gave him a gentle squeeze then stood back . \\n▁ ` ` but , i have to shoot you now . \\n▁ i wan na see how powerful i am without the pain . '' \\n▁ he cupped both my hands and shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` no way . \\n▁ we need to test you on something not living first . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i looked around . \\n▁ ` ` any suggestions ? '' \\n▁ ` ` a tree . '' \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ i said flatly . \\n▁ ` ` a tree is living . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , miss mother nature . \\n▁ fine . '' \\n▁ he flipped his chin in ryder 's direction . \\n▁ ` ` run down the barracks and get a couple of dumpsters , would ya ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sure thing , boss . '' \\n▁ ryder saluted and ran off with five guys in tow . \\n▁ ` ` here ya go , chief , '' a young knight said , waltzing toward us , carrying a boulder the size of a child like it was a box of paper . \\n▁ ` ` try this while we 're waitin ' . '' \\n▁ ` ` thanks , joe . '' \\n▁ mike aimed a finger to the centre of the field backing the hall . \\n▁ ` ` just plonk it right down there . '' \\n▁ ` ` no worries , sir . '' \\n▁ he ran off , jolly and spritely , and dropped the boulder , turning to check with us if the position was okay . \\n▁ we both gave him a thumbs - up . \\n▁ ` ` kay , ara . '' \\n▁ mike jammed his hands in his back pockets and stepped away from me . \\n▁ ` ` let 's see what you can do . '' \\n▁ i felt good about it , certain i could explode that morsel of rock with the blast and not end up flat on my back after . \\n▁ i leaned down into my knees a bit , rubbing my hands together . \\n▁ once upon a time , i needed to use a thought or a feeling to induce the electricity . \\n▁ but now , i could do it on command . \\n▁ i wondered if telekinesis would eventually end up that way for me . \\n▁ in fact , according to jase 's diary , if i practiced every day , it most certainly would . \\n▁ ` ` come on , ara . \\n▁ quit daydreaming , and shoot it . '' \\n▁ ` ` gim me a break . '' \\n▁ i turned back to look at mike , flicking just one finger toward the rock so i could watch his face as it exploded unexpectedly . \\n▁ and like i 'd imagined the very expression he 'd wear , the bottom of his jaw moved an inch apart from the top , and the whites dominated a larger part of his eyes . \\n▁ i did n't need to see the damage i caused . \\n▁ i heard it - heard an almighty shatter , like lightning splitting the earth , felt the rock debris hit the backs of my legs , saw the wind of the blast rush past and sweep my hair toward mike , the whole event ending in the shock on his face . \\n▁ i folded over , laughing . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ mike yanked me quickly to stand . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i watched realization melt the concern on his face . \\n▁ ` ` you 're laughing , ara . \\n▁ why are you laughing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you should ' ve seen the look on your face . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you kidding ? '' \\n▁ he grabbed my arm and turned me to face the field . \\n▁ ` ` did you see what you did ? \\n▁ it 's bloody lucky we tested you out on a rock first . '' \\n▁ i scanned the field for any signs of the boulder , but it 'd been obliterated . \\n▁ all that remained was a small group of knights on the other side , each holding a dumpster between them - completely frozen in place . \\n▁ ` ` take the dumpster back , '' mike called across to them . \\n▁ ` ` we need something more xxunk . '' \\n▁ they nodded once and shuffled away , looking rather relieved . \\n▁ ` ` well , then . '' \\n▁ mike patted my back as if i were one of the boys . \\n▁ ` ` best you go clean yourself up and fill jason in . '' \\n▁ i dusted my shirt off a bit and smudged a large smear of blood away from my chin . \\n▁ ` ` fill him in ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 'll wan na know what you just did . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you approve of that ? '' \\n▁ he flashed a simple smile . \\n▁ ` ` baby , he just solved one of the biggest problems i ' ve had on my mind since this whole thing began . \\n▁ he can have whatever he wants . '' \\n▁ i jumped onto my toes and wrapped my arms around mike 's neck . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , mike . '' \\n▁ ` ` ah , watch the shirt . '' \\n▁ he pulled me off gently , motioning to my bloodied mess of an outfit . \\n▁ ` ` sorry . '' \\n▁ i wiped some of the blood away with my hand , but only smudged it worse . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll go take a shower and come back down later , yeah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ and i 'll have the knights run laps through the forest to find you more boulders . '' \\n▁ ` ` sounds good . '' \\n▁ i nodded , then walked away with a huge smile on my face - my head completely pain free . \\n▁ i lay awake , fully clothed , listening to the clock tick across the room . \\n▁ the manor was a lonely place without the echo of maids cleaning , footmen laying plates or the gentle but distant chatter of house representatives . \\n▁ trouble was , at this hour it was too late to be night , and too early to be morning . \\n▁ i was stuck halfway between the world of the living and the dreaming . \\n▁ and worse , i could n't find the door to either . \\n▁ i stuffed my hand under my bottom and pulled my phone from my back pocket . \\n▁ david still had n't called - or messaged . \\n▁ nothing . \\n▁ if he was gon na fall off the face of the earth , the least he could do was let me know first . \\n▁ then again , maybe it was n't him . \\n▁ maybe it was me . \\n▁ perhaps my phone had stopped working somehow and was n't receiving calls . \\n▁ but that did n't explain why my inbox was empty . \\n▁ not even my dad had replied to my emails , and he promised to tell me how his appointment with the doctor went this week . \\n▁ ` ` quaid ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ my door popped open and a line of yellow light spilled into the room , licking the wall , then the xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` what 's up ? '' \\n▁ ` ` have you got cell service ? '' \\n▁ he lifted his phone from his pocket . \\n▁ ` ` yup . \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ of course he did . \\n▁ that was n't the problem ; that was n't the reason david had n't called . \\n▁ ` ` never mind . '' \\n▁ i turned my face away , and the room went dark again . \\n▁ but my heart leaped into my chest when a very loud , very obnoxious song played suddenly from the device in my hand . \\n▁ i almost dropped it three times trying to run my thumb across the screen to answer the video call . \\n▁ and as the name registered in my head and a face showed , shadowed by an early morning , i ran for my closet and switched on the light , simulating daytime . \\n▁ ` ` dad ? '' \\n▁ i almost cried , composing myself quickly . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? \\n▁ i hope i have n't caught you at a bad time . '' \\n▁ i motioned around my wardrobe . \\n▁ ` ` nope , just … getting dressed . '' \\n▁ ` ` heading out late today , huh ? '' \\n▁ he looked at his watch . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i had a study period before class , '' i lied . \\n▁ ` ` how 's things over there ? \\n▁ you never emailed me back . '' \\n▁ dad looked at my face for a long moment . \\n▁ ` ` and you were worried ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ there was a very slight delay in my movements from action to the screen , but dad did n't seem to notice . \\n▁ he looked as though he 'd just woken up - still in his plain tee and pyjama pants , a coffee by his elbow and the kitchen all kind of dark around him . \\n▁ ` ` well , we 're all fine here , honey , '' he assured me . \\n▁ ` ` i had my appointment with the cardiologist on thursday , and he 's adjusted my medication . \\n▁ says i 'll be fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't look fine , dad . \\n▁ you look … old . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` oh , there 's that brutal honesty i missed . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that ara ? '' \\n▁ vicki said , gliding into the room . \\n▁ her face lit up when she saw mine . \\n▁ ` ` ara , how are you ? \\n▁ we ' ve missed you so much . \\n▁ what are you doing up so early ? \\n▁ it must be , like - '' ` ` eleven a.m. , vicki . '' \\n▁ i plonked down on the ottoman by the shoe rack . \\n▁ ` ` oh , right , you 're ahead of us in paris . '' \\n▁ she sat down beside dad . \\n▁ ` ` you look well , '' she said , but it was a lie ; even i could see how pale and grainy i looked on the screen . \\n▁ ` ` your face has really rounded out since you left . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , great . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` is that mom - talk for ` you 're getting fat ' ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , dear . \\n▁ you look healthy , for once . \\n▁ not that skinny little kid that left us a few months ago . \\n▁ they must be feeding you well . '' \\n▁ i drew my stomach in and readjusted my jeans . \\n▁ maybe they were feeding me a little too well . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ food here is good . \\n▁ how 's sam ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's good . \\n▁ he got a dog , '' vicki said . \\n▁ ` ` a dog ? '' \\n▁ i looked at dad . \\n▁ ` ` you said we could never - '' ` ` he does n't have a dog , '' dad said , his hand entering the conversation . \\n▁ ` ` he 's got a follower , and that 's it . \\n▁ he 's not keeping it . '' \\n▁ ` ` whose dog is it ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` we do n't know . \\n▁ it has n't got tags or even a chip , '' vicki said . \\n▁ ` ` it 's this great monstrosity of a thing , '' she added . \\n▁ ` ` white , fluffy , drools way too much . '' \\n▁ dad turned his head and frowned at her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve never seen it drool . '' \\n▁ ` ` it licked my face the other day , '' she said , insulted . \\n▁ ` ` i had to take a shower . '' \\n▁ ` ` now , i do n't think that 's xxunk - '' ` ` so the dog decided to make a home with sam ? '' \\n▁ i cut in . \\n▁ ` ` for now . \\n▁ it 's not staying , though , '' vicki said . \\n▁ ` ` how often does it come by ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mostly on weekends . '' \\n▁ ` ` the dog knows the days of the week ? '' \\n▁ i asked drily . \\n▁ vicki nodded and shrugged at the same time . \\n▁ ` ` sam must be feeding it something really good then . '' \\n▁ vicki laughed . \\n▁ ` ` well , i do n't mind . \\n▁ the silly - looking thing helps with the laundry . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're kidding , '' i said absently , my mind going off on a tangent . \\n▁ a big , white , fluffy dog that helps with laundry . \\n▁ that was no stray . \\n▁ ` ` helper or not , sam knows the rules about dogs . '' \\n▁ dad stood up . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't mind him having it here for now , as long as he looks after it , and it does n't eat my azaleas . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think xxunk will - '' dad stopped half way between the kitchen and the table , and turned around . \\n▁ ` ` how 'd you know its name ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um . '' \\n▁ i bit my lip . \\n▁ ` ` vicki said xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` i did . '' \\n▁ she looked utterly confused . \\n▁ ` ` um , yeah . \\n▁ so , anyway … '' i hesitated . \\n▁ ` ` dad , can i talk to you alone for a minute ? '' \\n▁ he and vicki exchanged long glances , then she stood up and slowly left the room . \\n▁ but i was sure she 'd parked herself just around the corner . \\n▁ i did n't care , though . \\n▁ as long as she stayed out of this conversation . \\n▁ ` ` what 's up , honey ? '' \\n▁ he sat back down , angling the screen so i now looked onto the wall , which only confirmed that vicki was standing right there , listening . \\n▁ ` ` am i adopted ? '' \\n▁ dad 's eyes shot past the screen , coming back again a little wetter and sharper than before . \\n▁ he slowly breathed out and lined his fingers together under his chin . \\n▁ ` ` why do you ask ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just … just answer me , dad . '' \\n▁ the reflection of his eyes showed vicki 's face just before she appeared . \\n▁ she sat down beside him again and took his hand : the united front , ready for something it seemed they 'd been prepared for for a long time . \\n▁ ` ` yes , ara , '' vicki said for him . \\n▁ ` ` you 're adopted . '' \\n▁ finally , some truths . \\n▁ i had to choose which role to play then : the shocked daughter ; the angry teen who resented her adoptive parents , or the real me that just wanted to tell dad not to worry so much - that it was okay . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you ever tell me ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` to … there was just never a good time , '' dad said . \\n▁ ` ` well , now 's a good time . '' \\n▁ vicki stood . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll leave you both to it . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , vicki . '' \\n▁ dad patted her hand and turned back to face me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve wanted to tell you , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't doubt that , dad . '' \\n▁ ` ` i just … after i left your mom , she forbid me to tell you . \\n▁ she thought you 'd want to leave her and find your , what she called , ` ` real parents '' . \\n▁ not that she felt that way , but she thought you would . \\n▁ we planned to tell you once you turned eighteen , but - '' ` ` but you could n't do it . '' \\n▁ ` ` not after everything that happened . '' \\n▁ ` ` everything ? \\n▁ what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ the way he said that sentence made me think for a second that he knew about drake arresting and torturing me . \\n▁ ` ` you know , mom dying and you moving here - all that heartache , then breaking up with mike . \\n▁ i did n't want to complicate things further . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and , you know , i appreciate that , dad . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i ' m not sure i could ' ve coped with the truth then , but … i can now . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay then . '' \\n▁ he leaned forward , propping his elbows on the table . \\n▁ ` ` what would you like to know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` her name . \\n▁ my mom 's name . '' \\n▁ he smiled fondly . \\n▁ ` ` her name was rose . '' \\n▁ ` ` was ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sadly , honey , she passed away giving birth to you . '' \\n▁ my mouth opened as if i knew what to say , but i did n't . \\n▁ i just stared at dad 's face , waiting for him to speak . \\n▁ ` ` she was just a child when she had you , ara , sixteen , actually - '' ` ` sixteen ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ she thought she was in love with this boy , and they … well , you know how it goes . \\n▁ nine months later , you were born . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , well , how did you come to adopt me ? \\n▁ i mean , did you know rose ? '' \\n▁ ` ` rose was … '' he looked down . \\n▁ ` ` she was my baby sister , charged to my care after my mother passed away . '' \\n▁ sister ? \\n▁ i never even knew he had a sister . \\n▁ ` ` did my mom know her , too ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he smiled fondly . \\n▁ ` ` rose and eleanor were close , you know . \\n▁ eleanor was the support rose needed then . \\n▁ i just … i was a guy . \\n▁ i just did n't know what to do with a pregnant sixteen - year - old . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , then … '' i just felt more confused about it all . \\n▁ ` ` did you plan to adopt me all along , or was that forced on you after rose died ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it was never forced on us , ara . '' \\n▁ he shook his head impatiently . \\n▁ ` ` it was our choice . \\n▁ rose planned to raise you herself . \\n▁ but … '' ` ` but she died . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you became our little blessing . '' \\n▁ i truly believed him as he said that . \\n▁ i could tell from his voice that no matter how much pain i 'd brought him , there had always been more joy . \\n▁ ` ` did rose ever get to hold me ? '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` for a while . \\n▁ you were nearly a month early , so we all knew you might not survive , but we never imagined we 'd lose rose . '' \\n▁ ` ` how did it happen ? \\n▁ how do people just die from giving birth , dad ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we do n't know . '' \\n▁ ` ` how can you not know ? '' \\n▁ i asked , getting louder . \\n▁ ` ` she was in a car accident , honey , and went into early labour . \\n▁ she did n't have any major injuries , so they let her give birth naturally . \\n▁ and … when you were born , this pretty little blue baby , and rose held your tiny little hand , the reality of it hit her harder than we imagined . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` some say she died of a broken heart - that she could n't live in a world where her baby was dead . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i lived ! '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and i wish she 'd known that . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , if she 'd held on just a few more seconds - '' ` ` we do n't know , ara . \\n▁ no one can know god 's plan , '' he said softly in the ` dad ' tone that always made things feel better . \\n▁ ` ` but i think she knew , deep inside , that you 'd survive . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because she looked me right in the eye that day and asked me to take care of you and , a second later , she slipped away and you started crying . '' \\n▁ i could n't breathe . \\n▁ i sat with my lips slightly parted , picturing it all . \\n▁ ` ` eleanor came back in and she wrapped you up and kissed rose on the head , promised she would never let you go . '' \\n▁ my shaky hand moved to cover my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` so , we adopted you . \\n▁ but eleanor and i … we … '' ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we were never really together , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we made a pact to raise you as our own . \\n▁ but we were n't married . \\n▁ she changed her name so all three of us shared the same surname , and i loved her , ara . \\n▁ i loved eleanor like my own family . \\n▁ but not like a husband loves a wife . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was eleanor who gave you your second name - rose , '' vicki said softly , sitting down beside dad again . \\n▁ ` ` she wanted you to always carry a part of your mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` and … '' i took a jagged breath and steadied my tears . \\n▁ ` ` who 's my father ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , ara . '' \\n▁ dad shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i went to find him a few years ago , but all i found was his sister mavis . \\n▁ she told me he 'd been deployed to iraq after nine - eleven , and was killed in the line of duty . '' \\n▁ dad hung his head . \\n▁ ` ` he never made it home . '' \\n▁ the reality sunk through me , dragging my body into the ground . \\n▁ i was too late . \\n▁ if i 'd found out when i was younger , i might have at least seen my father , even once , and the weight of the unknown came down on me hard , undoing all the hopes i had for future where i knew him . \\n▁ how was that possibly fair ? \\n▁ ` ` what was his name ? '' \\n▁ i asked , pressing my thumb to my chin to stop it shaking . \\n▁ ` ` hayden matthews , and he looked … '' dad smiled , but his eyes held all the sadness of things gone by . \\n▁ ` ` he looked very much like you . '' \\n▁ ` ` dark hair ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` blue eyes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ his smile warmed . \\n▁ ` ` those were from rose . '' \\n▁ ` ` and … you say you 're her brother ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he nodded , and i almost believed him , save for the fact that david told me this man , who i called my father , had a ` distant ' ancestral connection to me . \\n▁ certainly not close enough to be my uncle . \\n▁ ` ` were … were you her adopted brother ? '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` why would you ask that ? '' \\n▁ i turned away . \\n▁ ` ` ara , honey . \\n▁ look at me . '' \\n▁ my eyes shifted sideways . \\n▁ dad 's arm was right in direct line of the camera . \\n▁ i knew his hand was against the screen - trying to reach out to me . \\n▁ ` ` i know that everything you thought you knew about yourself has just fallen apart , but i love you , and i - '' ` ` i love you , too , dad . '' \\n▁ i placed my fingertips to the screen . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve just got so much going on right now . \\n▁ i … i do n't know how to cope with it all . \\n▁ and i ' m not mad at you . \\n▁ i ' m not upset . \\n▁ i just … '' ` ` you just need a hug ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , wiping my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` where 's david ? '' \\n▁ vicki asked . \\n▁ ` ` he should really be here for this . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's away on business , '' i said , sobbing . \\n▁ ` ` and i ca n't get hold of him . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ dad asked , his tone flooding with worry . \\n▁ ` ` he 's just not answering his phone . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you have a fight ? '' \\n▁ vicki asked . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` but things are n't okay , are they ? '' \\n▁ dad said . \\n▁ i shook my head again . \\n▁ ` ` dad ? \\n▁ i … was anyone in my family ever … '' ` ` ever ? '' \\n▁ he prompted . \\n▁ ` ` infertile . '' \\n▁ he sat back in his chair , looking at vicki . \\n▁ ` ` honey , are you trying to have a baby ? '' \\n▁ i did n't even have time to speak ; vicki butted in with , ` ` ara , you 're too young . \\n▁ you 're barely - '' ` ` i know how old i am , vicki , and i do n't mean to sound nasty , but it 's not up to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would you want a baby , ara ? '' \\n▁ dad asked . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve only just married , and - '' ` ` david 's going to die , '' i said , and my eyes went wide around my shock . \\n▁ i did n't mean to say that , but it just slipped out . \\n▁ i guess i just needed to tell someone - needed someone to know how helpless and scared i felt all the time . \\n▁ but as i looked into both dad and vicki 's mortified faces , i wished i had n't said it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry , ara . '' \\n▁ vicki reached out and touched the screen . \\n▁ ` ` is it cancer ? '' \\n▁ i looked at dad , swallowing the lump in my throat . \\n▁ ` ` i … yeah , '' i said , because i was n't sure they 'd understand if i told them he was going to kill a vampire to void an ancient contract . \\n▁ ` ` oh , ara . '' \\n▁ vicki burst into tears . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just so , so sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` how long ? '' \\n▁ dad asked , broken inside but composed outside , as he always was . \\n▁ ` ` a few months . '' \\n▁ i wiped my nose , sniffling . \\n▁ ` ` we were hoping to have the happy news of a baby before he … '' my voice broke . \\n▁ dad sighed , lowering his head into his hands . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll be all right , ara , '' vicki said , rubbing dad 's back . \\n▁ ` ` why do people always say that ? '' \\n▁ i buried my face too . \\n▁ ` ` you know it wo n't . \\n▁ he 's going to die . \\n▁ and we ca n't even fall pregnant . \\n▁ what if it 's me , dad ? '' \\n▁ he looked up . \\n▁ ` ` what if it 's something wrong with me ? \\n▁ that means i ruined his only chance to know he was gon na be a dad before he … '' i stared at the wall for a second . \\n▁ ` ` there 's nothing after this for him . \\n▁ he does n't get to go on . \\n▁ he 'll be gone , and i wanted him to know he was going to have a little girl before he went . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , ara , please do n't think that way , '' vicki said . \\n▁ i could see how badly she just wanted to hold me , but we were divided by what they thought was thousands of miles . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll happen . \\n▁ i 'll pray for it everyday , i promise . \\n▁ you 'll have your little baby before he dies . '' \\n▁ ` ` if prayers could make me fall pregnant , vicki , i already would be . \\n▁ but i just do n't think i ' m meant to be a mom . '' \\n▁ dad reached out and touched the screen again . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you should come home for a bit . \\n▁ it might - '' ` ` i ca n't do that , dad . \\n▁ we have a life here . \\n▁ we have friends and responsibilities . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you have family here , '' vicki reasoned . \\n▁ ` ` i have family here , too , '' i said softly . \\n▁ ` ` david ca n't leave , and it 'd break his heart if i did . '' \\n▁ vicki exhaled ; i could see the loss of hope in her eyes . \\n▁ neither her nor dad knew what to say or what to do . \\n▁ and right on time , as if it were a bell to save me from further explanation , my phone grizzled , making a fuss , the caller i d swallowing dad and vicki 's faces . \\n▁ ` ` is that david ? '' \\n▁ vicki asked , clearly noticed my eyes light up . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i got ta go . '' \\n▁ i held my finger over the button to accept the call . \\n▁ ` ` i really need to take this . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , call us back later , ara , or we 'll worry , '' vicki said . \\n▁ i nodded , offering my most reassuring smile . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay , you know . '' \\n▁ ` ` we know , honey , '' dad said . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll talk later . '' \\n▁ ` ` bye . '' \\n▁ i ended their call and put david to my ear . \\n▁ ` ` david ! '' \\n▁ ` ` hey , sweetheart . \\n▁ you called ? '' \\n▁ ` ` only like fifty - thousand times . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , come on now , it was n't that many , '' he said playfully . \\n▁ ` ` it was more like - '' ` ` mom and dad called , '' i interrupted . \\n▁ ` ` ah , good . \\n▁ and how are they ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i told them you have cancer . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he said slowly , dragging the word out . \\n▁ ` ` it kind of slipped out that you 're gon na die . \\n▁ and i had to make up some comprehensible explanation . \\n▁ i mean , they picked up on my extreme sadness anyway . '' \\n▁ the silence on the other end of the line lasted too long . \\n▁ ` ` you 're sad ? '' \\n▁ ` ` is that a joke ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i just thought , for the sake of appearances , you 'd suck that up around your parents . '' \\n▁ ` ` suck it up ? \\n▁ suck it up ! \\n▁ david , would you suck it up ? \\n▁ would you - '' ` ` okay . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ his voice got louder . \\n▁ ` ` just … do n't yell at me . \\n▁ i really do n't want to fight with you . '' \\n▁ i released my fury with a groan . \\n▁ ` ` sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i ' m sorry , okay . \\n▁ i just … what 'd they say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they were devastated . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes ! \\n▁ they love you , david . \\n▁ they want to do anything they can to help . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` aw , i really wish we could tell them the truth . \\n▁ actually , i kinda wish your dad was a vampire . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you know how he always has that way of solving problems - or making you feel like they can be solved ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i bet he 'd have some clever way we could fix this drake contract . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , and i bet you 'd actually listen to him . '' \\n▁ ` ` as opposed to whom ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do listen to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` huh ! \\n▁ you so do not . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , maybe my track record is n't that great . \\n▁ but you got ta admit things have gotten better lately . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ but they 'd be better if he was actually here , with me . \\n▁ ` ` i thought about it , you know , '' he said after a while . \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` turning him - your dad . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i think we should discuss it . \\n▁ i think , even if he could n't find a way out of our situation , at least he 'd be here to take care of you - for eternity . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not a little girl , anymore , david . \\n▁ i do n't need an eternal dad , '' i snapped , then calmed myself . \\n▁ ` ` but , i mean , it 'd be nice if i did n't have to bury him one day . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , well , we 'll discuss it further when i get home . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m worried about his heart , though . \\n▁ he looks sick , you know . \\n▁ and he 's playing it cool , but - '' ` ` he 'll be fine . \\n▁ if he gets worse , i 'll turn him myself . '' \\n▁ i smiled . \\n▁ ` ` but you do n't know the secret of how to turn a human . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't i ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this is getting off topic . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is ? \\n▁ because i do n't remember setting a topic for discussion , '' i said playfully . \\n▁ he cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` how 's training ? '' \\n▁ ` ` great . \\n▁ now . '' \\n▁ ` ` why now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because jason saved my head from exploding yesterday . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` things got … bad . '' \\n▁ i shivered at the memory . \\n▁ ` ` jason comes bursting in , grabs me and hauls me outside and , no joke , as soon as he puts my hands in the ground , like , forces them into the soil , the pain stops . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're kidding ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nope . \\n▁ he said i need to ground my power , and added something about closed circuits , or whatever . '' \\n▁ ` ` how did he come up with that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's been thinking a lot about it . \\n▁ guess he had an epiphany . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's … i got ta admit , i do n't know much about science , but that was pretty clever . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's why i want him to have a lab , david . \\n▁ he can help me . \\n▁ you do n't know how much stress he 's taken off my shoulders by figuring out why i ' m getting those headaches . '' \\n▁ ` ` you were stressed about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course i was . \\n▁ how would you feel if you had to put yourself in that kind of pain every second day , and no one was going to help you … and no one cared ? \\n▁ you all just told me to get over it , but he never stopped thinking about it - researching it . '' \\n▁ he took a really long breath and let it out right into the mouthpiece of the phone . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you can have the lab - '' ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i jumped up and out of my seat . \\n▁ ` ` but , it comes with a huge but . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay with a but . '' \\n▁ ` ` i want a guard with you at all times when you 're together . \\n▁ do you think you can handle that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ oh , david , thank you . \\n▁ he 'll be so happy when i tell him . \\n▁ i wish you were here right now so i could kiss you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m smiling just thinking about it . '' \\n▁ i smiled too . \\n▁ ` ` and … '' he added . \\n▁ ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i want full reports on everything he 's doing with you , and why . '' \\n▁ ` ` sure . \\n▁ of course . \\n▁ i know he wo n't have any problem with that . '' \\n▁ ` ` all right then . \\n▁ go see walt and tell him to set up an account for jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ thanks , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ and just remember , ara , i ' m doing this for you , not him . \\n▁ i want answers , and i want to see something concrete by the time i get back . '' \\n▁ ` ` but that does n't give us much time . \\n▁ you 're coming back sunday , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was . \\n▁ but , things … '' he sighed . \\n▁ ` ` things are bad here . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i need to transport a few prisoners to the vampiric institution for the insane . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` what happened to them ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's … the vampire mind is still very human . \\n▁ there 's only so much one person can handle before they … well , before they lose it . '' \\n▁ i waited for a second , tense , feeling a kind of energy in david 's voice that made me wonder if one of those prisoners was … ` ` is pepper one of them ? '' \\n▁ he coughed , then cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not at liberty to discuss the prisoners , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i do n't want to . '' \\n▁ ` ` did she go nuts because of what you did , or was it something after that - '' ` ` have fun setting up the lab , ara . \\n▁ i 'll talk to you tomorrow . '' \\n▁ i went to speak , but he hung up the phone , and all the things i wanted to tell him about my birth parents suddenly went on hold , boiling up like bad news , making me so mad not to be able to get it all out . \\n▁ i opened messages on my phone and wrote : just thought you might like to know that i found out about my birth mother . \\n▁ she 's dead . \\n▁ so is my father . \\n▁ as soon as i pressed send , though , i felt worse . \\n▁ the phone rang a second later . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` david . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ that was really petty of me , i - '' ` ` no , my love . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i should n't have hung up on you . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . \\n▁ you ' ve told me not to ask about pepper . \\n▁ i should respect that . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you should n't . \\n▁ you 're my wife and you do have a right to know , but i … ara , i did that to her , '' he said , his voice shaking , ` ` and i ' m dead ashamed of myself . '' \\n▁ i held still in case the door to his emotions slammed shut in my face . \\n▁ i was n't sure what to say or how to move this conversation forward without forcing him back into his shell . \\n▁ ` ` when … um … when was the last time you saw her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` about a year or so before i met you . '' \\n▁ ` ` was she … like that then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not as bad . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you did n't do it to her , david . '' \\n▁ i practically laughed with relief . \\n▁ ` ` maybe time has , or … i do n't know . \\n▁ but you should n't blame yourself . '' \\n▁ ` ` thanks , ara . \\n▁ you 're sweet to say that , but you do n't know the full story . '' \\n▁ ` ` i would if you 'd tell me . '' \\n▁ ` ` one day . \\n▁ maybe . '' \\n▁ i nodded , even though he could n't see it . \\n▁ one day , maybe , was good enough for me . \\n▁ ` ` so , how do you know she 's insane ? \\n▁ like , what did she say to you when you saw her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's just it . \\n▁ she did n't even recognize me . '' \\n▁ ` ` at all ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she was too busy peeling her own skin back and eating it to notice anything other than a passing rat she could mutilate . '' \\n▁ i let out a shaky breath . \\n▁ ` ` david , i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is what it is . \\n▁ so … '' his tone changed , taking the subject with it . \\n▁ ` ` your dad told you about rose ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ wait . \\n▁ i never mentioned her name . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i ' ve known about her for a while . \\n▁ i was waiting until i had news of a nice family somewhere out there waiting to meet you before i said anything , but … i never found anything on your biological father . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay , you know . \\n▁ i still have my dad and vicki . '' \\n▁ ` ` and me . '' \\n▁ ` ` for a while . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but i ' m still here , and i love you , and i ' m sorry we ' ve fought today . '' \\n▁ ` ` me too . \\n▁ i hate fighting . '' \\n▁ ` ` me too . '' \\n▁ after a long silence , with me lost trying to think of something else to say to keep him on the line , he said , ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` i have to go . \\n▁ i 'll call you tomorrow , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` love you . '' \\n▁ ` ` love you , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ chapter nine ` ` jase . '' \\n▁ i leaped off the last step and ran into his arms at full speed , well , full human speed . \\n▁ he caught me gracefully , gave me a quick squeeze , and placed me gently back on the ground . \\n▁ ` ` you 're awfully cheery today , ara . \\n▁ what 's up ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he went for it , jase . \\n▁ i do n't know if it was just pure luck or if david woke up on the right side of bed , but he approved it . '' \\n▁ i stood back , swiping my hair from my face . \\n▁ ` ` approved what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` your lab , silly ! '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed , his brows forming two lines in the middle , just like david when he was utterly confused . \\n▁ ` ` when ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i talked to him on the phone this morning , then i went to see walt to get the budget plan . \\n▁ jase , you have the full backing of the house , and an unlimited budget . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm - hm . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , that 's … '' he scratched his head , still looking a little mixed by his emotions . \\n▁ ` ` that 's great ! '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , right ? '' \\n▁ i tapped his arm once . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a condition , though . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i have to have a guard present whenever we 're researching or training . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's - '' he nodded , smiling . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , that 's more than fine . \\n▁ more than fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` i knew you 'd say that . '' \\n▁ i clapped once , bouncing on my toes . \\n▁ ` ` we have to celebrate . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` and i know just the place to go . '' \\n▁ ` ` out on the town ? '' \\n▁ i joked . \\n▁ ` ` better . '' \\n▁ he patted my arm as he walked past . \\n▁ ` ` have everyone meet at the lighthouse tonight . '' \\n▁ ` ` ooh , lighthouse party . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he walked backward , the reality clearly having sunken in to his smile . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a tradition around these parts . '' \\n▁ ` ` to celebrate on a lighthouse ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he started up the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` and tell blade he better be there . '' \\n▁ ` ` i will . '' \\n▁ i watched him disappear into the second floor corridor , then turned to look back at falcon , who was standing inconspicuously in the shadows nearby . \\n▁ ` ` you coming , fal ? '' \\n▁ he stepped forward , his hands clasped in front . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll understand if i do n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you do n't approve . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't say i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` of what ? \\n▁ the lab or the party ? '' \\n▁ he cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` blade 's in the library , preparing for your lesson on royal popularity , if you 're looking for him . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ i nodded once . \\n▁ ` ` i get it . \\n▁ you do n't approve of either . '' \\n▁ ` ` only because both situations put you in position to end up in trouble . '' \\n▁ ` ` blade will be there tonight , and you 'll be there at every training session . '' \\n▁ ` ` i wish i could say that gives me comfort . '' \\n▁ ` ` well - '' i turned away . \\n▁ ` ` it 's too bad , falcon . \\n▁ if david agrees , you can bloody - well get over it . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , your majesty , '' he said resolutely , following me up the stairs . \\n▁ i wished i could tell him to go away . \\n▁ he 'd made me mad now , and i really did n't even want to be in the same space as him . \\n▁ in my old life , i could ' ve stormed off and slammed my bedroom door , but this version of me had to wear any disdain under her sleeve and express only composure . \\n▁ it sucked . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , ara . '' \\n▁ i stopped and angled my neck slowly to see falcon . \\n▁ he 'd stopped about six paces behind me , hanging his head . \\n▁ ` ` what for ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you have every right to celebrate this . \\n▁ what happened at training the other day was spectacular , and if it were n't for jason , it would n't have happened . '' \\n▁ i walked down a few steps and stood on the one just above him so we were almost the same height . \\n▁ ` ` look , i respect you , falcon . \\n▁ a lot . \\n▁ and i. . . '' \\n▁ i thought about it for a second . \\n▁ ` ` your support would mean a lot to me , you know . '' \\n▁ he looked up , his face swapping the sternness for a smile . \\n▁ ` ` i support the result . \\n▁ just not so much the process . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you 'll come to the party tonight ? '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't say i 'll go that far , but i wo n't stop you from going . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i did n't think you would . '' \\n▁ he wet his lips , nodding . \\n▁ ` ` i was planning to . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` come on . '' \\n▁ he walked ahead of me . \\n▁ ` ` let 's go find blade and tell him the good news . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't believe you were going to stop me . '' \\n▁ ` ` hang on . '' \\n▁ he cordoned me off from the last step with the back of his forearm . \\n▁ i stopped abruptly against his sleeve . \\n▁ ` ` why are we hanging on ? '' \\n▁ ` ` em and mike are in there . '' \\n▁ he nodded to the great hall . \\n▁ ` ` so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so , they 're arguing . '' \\n▁ ` ` are we listening in ? '' \\n▁ i asked with a laugh . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he lowered his arm . \\n▁ ` ` we 're respectfully not trespassing . '' \\n▁ ` ` but we 're going to the library . '' \\n▁ ` ` and if we walk past now , they might think we heard them . '' \\n▁ ` ` so what if we do ? \\n▁ they should take their business somewhere private . '' \\n▁ i shoved past falcon and nearly tumbled backward down the step as emily flew past us suddenly , her face in her hands . \\n▁ ` ` em ? '' \\n▁ i called , but she evaporated . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ falcon asked . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i let go of the railing and dusted myself off . \\n▁ ` ` she was in a real hurry . '' \\n▁ falcon looked over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` trouble in paradise . '' \\n▁ ` ` so it would seem . '' \\n▁ i considered the doors to the great hall for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m gon na go see if mike 's okay . '' \\n▁ falcon nodded once and fell back into guard mode behind me . \\n▁ the lone figure sitting at the right hand of the king 's chair did n't notice falcon and i on the balcony above him . \\n▁ his head was in his hands , his troubles somewhere on the ground between his feet . \\n▁ i tiptoed down the curvy staircase , my hand tracing the railing and , once at the bottom , appeared at vamp speed beside him . \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ he lifted his head and our eyes met . \\n▁ i expected to see tears , but he just looked worn . \\n▁ ` ` hey , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` what just happened ? \\n▁ emily all but caused a tornado on her way outta here . '' \\n▁ he sighed and his brow landed against his thumb , his elbow on his knee . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't do it anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` do what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this business with emily . '' \\n▁ he sat tall again . \\n▁ ` ` ever since she left university and moved here , she 's been really needy and whiney . \\n▁ i just … '' ` ` she 's probably just bored . \\n▁ i 'll assign her a task other than council member . \\n▁ maybe she - '' ` ` she gave me back the ring . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i screeched . \\n▁ ` ` she gave it back to me - last night . \\n▁ she just walked up and said she was done , that she did n't want to get married anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , mike . '' \\n▁ i sat down in david 's chair . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ mike spun around to face me , tucking his legs under the table . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , she took it back this morning - she was over it , you know , whatever made her break up with me . \\n▁ but - '' ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ ` ` but i did n't want her to take it back . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i reached out and wound my fingers in the ball of his fist . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m exhausted , to be honest , ara . \\n▁ and i think maybe i jumped into a relationship too soon after we broke it off . \\n▁ i just - '' he leaned back in the chair and looked up at the roof . \\n▁ ` ` i just need some time to clear my head . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` she 'll understand . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , she did n't . '' \\n▁ he presented the room , aiming his hand off to the path emily had taken in haste . \\n▁ ` ` she ditched the ring at my head . '' \\n▁ i tried not to laugh . \\n▁ ` ` she did ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he looked around the floor for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't even know where it landed . \\n▁ for all i know , with a throw like that , it went through twenty - odd walls and ended up in the library . '' \\n▁ i laughed then . \\n▁ so much for sensitivity . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll find it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` but she 's not getting it back this time , ara . \\n▁ i ' m done . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're ending it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he stood up . \\n▁ ` ` she ended it . '' \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ i started , but he walked from the room , and i just watched , deciding then that inviting him to our lighthouse celebration was a bad idea , especially considering how much he hated jason . \\n▁ ` ` this party is getting smaller and smaller , '' i said to falcon . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure emily will go . '' \\n▁ i looked up to where he stood on the balcony of the second floor . \\n▁ ` ` can you go ask her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ he bowed and turned away . \\n▁ nate headed out of the library as i waltzed in , and he flashed a quick grin , holding up the latest book he borrowed , then hurried off before i could ask him about the party . \\n▁ i knew he 'd come , though , without question . \\n▁ ` ` blade , '' i called into the open space , searching up , down , and around with my entire body . \\n▁ the curtains were drawn across the great windows , the room dark and empty . \\n▁ i noticed the projector set up on a table across from a whiteboard , and a stack of notes beside it , but blade was nowhere to be seen . \\n▁ ` ` blade ? \\n▁ you here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` hey , ara . '' \\n▁ my eyes moved quickly to the bookcases under the balcony , landing on a hunched figure in the armchair . \\n▁ it was so dark that if he had n't spoken , even my vampire night vision would n't have noticed him . \\n▁ ` ` why are we sitting in the dark ? '' \\n▁ i asked , wandering over . \\n▁ he smiled up at me where i sat on the arm of the chair . \\n▁ ` ` you spoken to em today ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , but i heard about her and mike . '' \\n▁ he stood up , the leather squeaking behind him . \\n▁ ` ` she loves him , you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` why does n't he get it ? \\n▁ it 's so simple . '' \\n▁ he stopped with both hands propping him up against the oak table . \\n▁ ` ` she just wants his affection , his love , maybe a little attention . \\n▁ it 's like he does n't want her , ara , like he keeps her all to himself because he wants to prove he 's really gotten over you . '' \\n▁ ` ` he has . '' \\n▁ i stood , too . \\n▁ ` ` emily 's not his trophy girlfriend , blade . \\n▁ he loves her . '' \\n▁ ` ` not enough . \\n▁ not enough to have asked her to marry him . '' \\n▁ ` ` why so sensitive about this ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she 's my friend , ara . \\n▁ i care about her . '' \\n▁ i laughed in the back of my throat . \\n▁ ` ` does … does she know you 're all cut up about this ? '' \\n▁ he dropped his hand from his head and looked at me disapprovingly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not all cut up . '' \\n▁ i smiled , and it made him smile , too . \\n▁ ` ` then why ca n't i feel the pulse of our bind - your never - ending - curse - of - lilith - love that you ' ve had for me all these months ? '' \\n▁ i teased . \\n▁ ` ` shut up , '' he said with a grin and sat down on the chair . \\n▁ ` ` oh god . \\n▁ why ca n't i fall for someone who is n't taken by a high - ranking member of my new society ? '' \\n▁ i laughed and sat down beside him . \\n▁ ` ` now , what fun would that be ? '' \\n▁ he bumped me softly with his elbow . \\n▁ ` ` well , all jokes aside , and no disrespect but , i ' m glad i do n't love you anymore . '' \\n▁ i leaned my head on his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` me too , blade . \\n▁ and , hey , bright side ? '' \\n▁ i sat up again . \\n▁ ` ` she 'll be at the party tonight . '' \\n▁ ` ` party ? '' \\n▁ i paused for dramatic effect . \\n▁ ` ` we got approval for the lab . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i just smiled and continued . \\n▁ ` ` we 're going to the lighthouse to eat and drink in celebration . \\n▁ jason told me to make sure you were coming . '' \\n▁ ` ` he knows i 'd never miss it . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , and you have to come anyway . \\n▁ i need a guard . '' \\n▁ ` ` lem me guess , '' he said flatly . \\n▁ ` ` falcon does n't approve of you hanging out with jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` not really . '' \\n▁ ` ` they all need to give that guy a break . '' \\n▁ he pushed the chair out with the backs of his legs and stood up again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve never seen anything but the good he 's done for you since he 's been here . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but i guess they just find it hard to forgive what he did in the past . '' \\n▁ ` ` yet they praise the king for more heinous actions . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's just the way it is . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` well , i got his back , ara , you know that , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ he clapped once . \\n▁ ` ` then we have a lesson to get started on . '' \\n▁ the global view from the rooftop spread my little world outward , but the sight of the new greenhouse narrowed it in again , stealing the glamour from the winding beige roads , the unending fields of green grass , and the vast clusters of trees . \\n▁ i half expected it to be a modest , kind of rounded conservatory , the glass maybe frosted and opaque , but i was dead wrong . \\n▁ i was wrong about the rooftop , too . \\n▁ in my mind , i 'd pictured a grey , water - damaged cement surface , cluttered up with blackened xxunk and broken roof tiles . \\n▁ but it was remarkably spacious and flat , spread wide across the east wing , dropping at the edges into slanted tiles , peaked at the window points over the attics on the rear face of the building . \\n▁ ahead , the large dome marking the manor entrance caught the sunlight , making it glint in my direction , but even with all its glorious colours , it sat in pale contrast to the wall of glass arthur and david had commissioned . \\n▁ clearly , they 'd been planning it for much longer than i realized . \\n▁ its sheer magnitude and ambience was probably visible from the furthest bridge connecting xxunk island to the mainland . \\n▁ it stood at least thirty feet above the manor , the ceiling forming a long peak down the length of it , so clear and open it was a glistening shrine to the sun , inviting its golden beams down onto the mess of greenery inside . \\n▁ i was n't sure where 'd they stuffed the lab , but there was no sign of another room anywhere up here . \\n▁ as i neared the building , i scanned the windows for sight of arthur . \\n▁ word had it that he was up here pottering around somewhere , but there were at least four rows of tables and planters inside , and i was n't sure i 'd spot him once i was in the thick of it all . \\n▁ i pushed the door open and stared down the barrel of the first aisle : greenery , stacked high up to the ceilings , came face to face with what i imagined were special kinds of lights for growing things . \\n▁ there was a warm buzz in the air with the sound of life , and under the heat that saturated the room there was a gentle sound of dripping water and a rich soil flavour settling on the scent of newly budding flowers . \\n▁ it was beautiful and almost tropical . \\n▁ a flicker of movement down the end caught my eye then , steering it to the busy - looking figure trimming leaves off a plant and laying them in a tub at his feet . \\n▁ he looked old from back here - hunched and almost weathered , but as i drew closer , my eyes adjusted to his form , and his youthful appearance altered my first impression . \\n▁ ` ` arthur ? '' \\n▁ he looked up , laying the scissors down . \\n▁ ` ` amara ? \\n▁ what brings you here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` came to see the new lab . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you now ? '' \\n▁ he asked in a tone that indicated disbelief . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , um - '' i stood beside him , wrapping myself up in my own arms . \\n▁ ` ` and to see if you 'd heard yet . '' \\n▁ ` ` about jason 's lab ? \\n▁ yes . '' \\n▁ he walked across to the planters opposite us . \\n▁ ` ` and i hear celebrations are in order . '' \\n▁ ` ` yup . \\n▁ lighthouse party . '' \\n▁ i turned to watch him . \\n▁ ` ` so , you 'll come ? '' \\n▁ ` ` would n't miss it . '' \\n▁ ` ` great . \\n▁ so - '' i looked around . \\n▁ ` ` where 's your lab ? '' \\n▁ he tapped his foot on the ground a few times . \\n▁ ` ` you 're standing on it . '' \\n▁ i stepped back as though i really were actually standing on a lab , and not a dirt floor . \\n▁ ` ` we used some of the attic space , '' he explained . \\n▁ ` ` would you like to see it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um , not just now . '' \\n▁ i waved a politely dismissive hand . \\n▁ ` ` i uh … '' he drew a loud breath , but kept working like i was n't even there , letting it out with , ` ` you want something . '' \\n▁ ` ` um , yeah . '' \\n▁ i leaned against the table . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted to ask you about why you came here . '' \\n▁ ` ` here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not to the greenhouse , but i heard that when you signed on to this whole ` ` project kill drake '' , the reward you were seeking was … '' he stiffened a little , standing straight . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve spoken with morgaine . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i took a step closer . \\n▁ ` ` arthur , i - '' ` ` you ' ve nothing to worry about , my dear . '' \\n▁ he turned and lay a firm hand to my shoulder - that gentle reassurance only he seemed able to give with just a simple touch . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not going anywhere . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ she told me you 'd changed your mind , and - '' ` ` i have n't changed my mind about anything , amara . '' \\n▁ he picked up the scissors and began trimming the plant again . \\n▁ ` ` i still want to die . \\n▁ but i wo n't . \\n▁ i promised david i would be your eternal guardian . '' \\n▁ the regret in his tone sent an arrow into my chest . \\n▁ ` ` why do you want to die , arthur ? '' \\n▁ ` ` vampires love eternally , my dear . \\n▁ and no matter how many remedies i mix - '' he motioned around the greenhouse . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't mix one for a broken heart . '' \\n▁ i swallowed hard , nodding to hide the rush of tears in my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` so , you still love her - xxunk - so deeply after all this time ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he said simply . \\n▁ ` ` despite the absence of her soul from this world , i am sure i love more each passing day . '' \\n▁ my hand moved to rest on my heart , barely containing the ache that wanted to consume me . \\n▁ ` ` then why did you promise david you 'd stay alive ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i know the pain you will suffer without him . '' \\n▁ he looked sideways at me for just a second . \\n▁ ` ` and i will be here to make sure you never go to join him . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ if i 'd be happier dead , why would you stop me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` same reason you 'd stop me , amara . '' \\n▁ he laid the scissors down again and walked slowly over , placing one hand then the other on my arms , gripping firmly . \\n▁ ` ` where there is life , there is hope . \\n▁ and you are the hope of many . \\n▁ i can not let that die . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i ' m sad for you , arthur . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't waste your thoughts on me , amara . \\n▁ i ' m an old man , and i can do enough worrying for myself . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i reached out and toyed aimlessly with a leaf . \\n▁ ` ` but , i just want you to be happy . '' \\n▁ ` ` for what it 's worth - '' he smiled lovingly down at me . \\n▁ ` ` i am . \\n▁ you make me happy . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , arthur . '' \\n▁ i felt my cheeks flush a little . \\n▁ ` ` you 're too nice to have suffered so much . '' \\n▁ he laughed through his nose , turning away again to go about his business . \\n▁ ` ` sufferance does not befall the ungracious , princess ; it presents itself to he who knows love and happiness , because without those , one can not suffer . '' \\n▁ ` ` what if there was a way ? '' \\n▁ i said , running my thumb down the leaf repeatedly . \\n▁ i was n't sure how he 'd react to this , but i had to at least ask . \\n▁ ` ` a way to what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what if there was a way to reverse death , her death ? '' \\n▁ he did n't show it , did n't make it obvious , but he was n't down with it . \\n▁ not one bit . \\n▁ all he said , in a calm voice , was ` ` men must not dig where gods lay stones . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you must have at least thought about it ? \\n▁ even once . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course i have . \\n▁ what man would n't ? \\n▁ but it 's not right , amara . \\n▁ deliberate reincarnation , it … it 's against the laws of nature , and god . '' \\n▁ ` ` not necessarily . '' \\n▁ his stern gaze met mine . \\n▁ ` ` what have you found ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not the same spell drake uses , arthur - '' i held back for a second . \\n▁ if i told him what i found in the book of shadows , there was a very real chance he might stop me from using it . \\n▁ ` ` it 's something else . '' \\n▁ his lips folded inward , making a stern line . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a spell written by lilith , we think . \\n▁ i found it in morgana 's book of - '' ` ` amara , you must not meddle in the - '' ` ` but i have magic . '' \\n▁ i held my hand up . \\n▁ ` ` you said it yourself . \\n▁ you said all immortal beings , all born immortals have magic of a kind . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , of a kind . \\n▁ that does not mean you can perform witchcraft . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? \\n▁ drake can . '' \\n▁ ` ` drake ? '' \\n▁ he laughed and turned away , propping his hands on the counter in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` drake has no soul , amara . \\n▁ and it is witchcraft that turned it to ash . '' \\n▁ ` ` arthur , what if it did n't have to be that way ? \\n▁ what if i could use white magic to bring things back to life ? '' \\n▁ ` ` there is no magic that can bring things back to life , my girl . '' \\n▁ he spun around , his voice grumbling with rage in the back of his throat . \\n▁ ` ` it 's the devil 's work : trickery . \\n▁ you might think you hold the power , but when you cross those boundaries , you open xxunk for darker things , and i ca n't protect you from those . '' \\n▁ ` ` this spell i found , arthur - '' i took a step closer , looking up into his bright blue eyes . \\n▁ ` ` it 's … it originally came from aide - xxunk de xxunk , '' i lied . \\n▁ arthur went to speak , but his mouth just sat slightly open , caught on his words . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a page missing from the back . \\n▁ i lined them up perfectly , arthur . \\n▁ i know it 's lilith 's spell . \\n▁ i can feel it . '' \\n▁ i touched my heart . \\n▁ he sniffed once . \\n▁ ` ` do you have it on you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not that stupid . \\n▁ i know you 'll take it from me . '' \\n▁ he smiled . \\n▁ ` ` then you know me well . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do , '' i said , taking a very casual stroll around the plant tables . \\n▁ ` ` but you do n't know me , not like you think you do . \\n▁ i ' m not as dumb as i pretend to be . '' \\n▁ ` ` i never said you were , amara . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ but you think i 'd dabble in the darkness of black magic . '' \\n▁ ` ` i think you would do anything to get david back after he dies , and i think you came to me today , not to ask if i would want xxunk resurrected , but if i thought you were capable of performing the spell . '' \\n▁ whoa . \\n▁ yep . \\n▁ no messing about with guys this old . \\n▁ i let out a long , hard breath . \\n▁ ` ` amara , my dear , sweet girl . '' \\n▁ he appeared beside me , slowly taking my hand up to his lips . \\n▁ ` ` you know i love you - '' he kissed it , '' - as if you were my own blood . \\n▁ but i will not stand by and see you make the mistakes your ancestors made . \\n▁ you can not perform that spell , and if you do , your soul will pay the price . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's white magic , arthur . \\n▁ it uses the will of mother nature . \\n▁ it can bring things back if she gives them passage . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ and i happen to know that drake has searched for this spell for some centuries . \\n▁ but i know god gives no man right to play his game . \\n▁ for every action , there is an equal and opposite reaction . \\n▁ you know this . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do . \\n▁ but i ' m willing to suffer any consequence to save david - to bring him back . \\n▁ even if it means the price for balance in the natural order of things is my own life . '' \\n▁ ` ` what if it was n't ? '' \\n▁ he said , and paused . \\n▁ ` ` what if it was the life of someone you love ? \\n▁ your father , perhaps ? \\n▁ could you live with the guilt ? '' \\n▁ my eyes drifted slowly down to my feet . \\n▁ ` ` but , what if the spell can also cure immortality - help the damned ? '' \\n▁ ` ` immortality is not a disease , my dear . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ it 's a curse . \\n▁ and it haunts those children , arthur . \\n▁ i ca n't bear the thought of them never growing up , '' i cried , pointing off to the side as if the damned house was there . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want any more pain for them . \\n▁ i do n't want anyone suffering . \\n▁ i just want things to be normal . '' \\n▁ he swept in and embraced me , pressing his lips to my hair . \\n▁ ` ` i wish i could go back and stop david before he gave you blood that first time , amara . \\n▁ i want normality for you more than you could possibly know . \\n▁ but we have to accept what we can not change , and change only what we can . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is possible to change this , though , arthur . \\n▁ i can do this spell . \\n▁ you know i can . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know you are more powerful than you realise . \\n▁ but i have to ask you not to try it . \\n▁ i ' ve given my reasons . '' \\n▁ he stepped back from me . \\n▁ ` ` and you will either listen or you wo n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` the thing is , arthur , i ' ve heard you , but i do n't agree with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , you always have had a mind of your own , my dear . \\n▁ what am i if not a man who has lived many centuries and experienced all walks of life ? \\n▁ why should you believe anything i have to say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i feel it in my heart that this is the right thing , that this spell can help . '' \\n▁ ` ` you feel that this spell can bring david back , and that is all you care about : consequences be damned . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , you got me then , do n't ya ? '' \\n▁ i said sarcastically , turning my palms up . \\n▁ ` ` guess you do know everything . '' \\n▁ ` ` amara , you know i feel the same - we all do . \\n▁ we all want him to live as much as you do - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i held my index finger up . \\n▁ ` ` not as much as i do . \\n▁ you can not comprehend how badly i do n't want him to die , or what i ' m willing to do to stop it . '' \\n▁ he looked deep into my eyes , right past the barrier i forged , and pierced my soul . \\n▁ ` ` i do see what you will sacrifice for this , and i understand it . \\n▁ you know i do , so do not accuse me of ignorance , my dear . \\n▁ i know better than any man what it means to lose those you love . '' \\n▁ he wiped a hand across his mouth and turned away , the breath he exhaled coming out jagged . \\n▁ ` ` i just do n't want to lose you in the process . '' \\n▁ ` ` you know you ca n't stop me . '' \\n▁ he nodded but did n't turn around - didn ' t look at me . \\n▁ ` ` i would n't think to . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ i nodded once and , with fists tight , turned away like a solider with marching orders . \\n▁ the forest leaned in as i entered , watching me walk the path toward the stone . \\n▁ i felt my way along the columns of trees , pulled by the force of nature surrounding everything in this place , keeping my eyes closed until the radiant warmth emanating off the stone marked the end of my journey . \\n▁ i sat down against it and pulled the rumpled paper from my pocket , angling it so the sun lit the page . \\n▁ the first item the junction spell called for was something dead . \\n▁ i frowned , chewing my lip . \\n▁ i really had n't thought this one through . \\n▁ ` ` dead things … dead things , '' i said to myself , looking around . \\n▁ the only dead things at the manor were the drained humans in the feeding block . \\n▁ and the idea of digging through a pile of rotting corpses was not really all that appealing . \\n▁ ` ` any suggestions ? '' \\n▁ i asked the forest . \\n▁ a cool breeze settled around the base of the ancient trees then , flicking crunchy leaves toward my feet in a small pile . \\n▁ i tilted my head back and looked up at the sky , casting my eyes quickly back to the ground after . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't get it . '' \\n▁ the leaves flickered in the wind again , the corner of one so dry it snapped off under my bare foot , and at the same time , so too snapped a conclusion : dead leaves . \\n▁ of course . \\n▁ ` ` thanks . '' \\n▁ with the spell in one hand , death in the other , i read the words aloud , feeling the pull of nature surge through my feet , up my legs , into my heart and down through my fingertips , charging them , making the energy within burn like fire . \\n▁ and at the point i expected the brown leaf in my palm to ignite , it came to life : green starting up the stem , spreading out like rivers of water along the veins , bringing moisture and elasticity back to its surface until , finally , i felt its spirit again . \\n▁ the blue light in my fingers receded , leaving me open - mouthed and breathless . \\n▁ ` ` you have got to be kidding me . '' \\n▁ the leaf seemed to revel in the sunshine , the magic of life tingling against my fingertips . \\n▁ i put it down quickly and shuffled back , waiting to see if it shrivelled and folded in on itself , dying without the touch of my curious blue light . \\n▁ but it stayed there , gently blowing in the wind , green and soft and supple . \\n▁ alive . \\n▁ i gave life . \\n▁ my body , my power , i gave life . \\n▁ but it was just a leaf . \\n▁ it had neither breath nor consciousness . \\n▁ jason said this spell made a path for a soul to cross over , not that it would regenerate an aged , lifeless body . \\n▁ all living things had souls , even the smallest ant or rose bud , but their souls were different to a human 's - they went to a different place . \\n▁ how could this spell to create a doorway or a path be used to restore something physical - to reverse ageing ? \\n▁ ` ` easy , '' said a voice across the clearing . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't the spell that did it . '' \\n▁ ` ` then what did ? '' \\n▁ jason went to speak , his mouth sitting open for a second , but he closed it , shaking his head as he came to sit beside me . \\n▁ ` ` you . '' \\n▁ ` ` me ? '' \\n▁ i almost laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't restore life . '' \\n▁ ` ` not the kind you 're hoping to restore , no . \\n▁ but , you are the xxunk of the mortal realm . \\n▁ and with that comes certain abilities . '' \\n▁ ` ` abilities ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they 're different for each of your kind . \\n▁ in my research , when i studied xxunk back at college , i found that lilith had the power to restore life to animals . \\n▁ she tried to extend that power to humans and even xxunk , but it was very limited . '' \\n▁ ` ` so … she could bring a dog back to life ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yep . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , what ? \\n▁ i get plant life ? '' \\n▁ jase laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i guess so . '' \\n▁ ` ` great . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my fingertips . \\n▁ ` ` that 's gon na come in handy one day , i ' m sure of it . '' \\n▁ he laughed again . \\n▁ ` ` do n't think of it as something useful to you , but more of something that can benefit everything around you . '' \\n▁ he motioned to the forest . \\n▁ i smiled up at the trees . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , you 're right . \\n▁ and i did see a sad - looking rose bush on my way in . \\n▁ maybe i can at least help it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i bet you can . \\n▁ now - '' he plucked the page from my fingertips . \\n▁ ` ` what were you hoping to achieve here ? '' \\n▁ i eyed the spell . \\n▁ ` ` i … i thought maybe , since david 's soul will be ` disconnected ' from this realm when he uses the dagger , i might be able to bring him back . '' \\n▁ he slowly reached out for me . \\n▁ ` ` sweet girl , you do n't have this kind of magic . '' \\n▁ ` ` how do you know ? '' \\n▁ i jerked away . \\n▁ ` ` this is witchcraft , ara . \\n▁ you 're not a witch . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i have magic . '' \\n▁ ` ` you have nature 's magic . \\n▁ it wo n't support this kind of spell . '' \\n▁ ` ` then … maybe i can heal his body after he dies . \\n▁ maybe i can start his heart , and the soul will slip back into the human form - like resuscitation ? '' \\n▁ i suggested . \\n▁ ` ` i doubt it , ara . \\n▁ that 's not what - '' ` ` why are you so quick to shoot me down , jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i do n't want you to be disappointed when it fails , '' he said in a slightly louder voice . \\n▁ ` ` when it fails , huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ when , '' he repeated , lifting my chin so our eyes met . \\n▁ ` ` ara , i support everything you do , one - hundred per cent . \\n▁ but this wo n't save david . \\n▁ i know this , to my core . \\n▁ if you keep hoping , all you 'll do is make it hurt more at the end . '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't know that it 'll fail . \\n▁ how can you possibly know that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . '' \\n▁ jase opened his arms . \\n▁ ` ` you 're absolutely right . \\n▁ so , try it on me : start my heart . \\n▁ if i ' m wrong , i will apologise and we 'll go from there . '' \\n▁ i sat up on my knees . \\n▁ ` ` seriously ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he unbuttoned his shirt a little and grabbed my hand , placed it against his heart . \\n▁ ` ` go on . \\n▁ but if i ' m right , you need to drop this and realise that you ca n't resuscitate david . \\n▁ and also that if the junction spell were to actually work , it would require a witch , ara . \\n▁ not an xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i nodded , repositioning my hand on his chest . \\n▁ his body felt cool and soft under my touch , the gentle rhythm of his needless breath moving his chest up and down a little faster now than before . \\n▁ he waited expectantly while i focused , feeling all life move from within the forest , through me . \\n▁ but nothing happened . \\n▁ it was as if i 'd poured water onto a lidded container : the power just did n't go through - wasn ' t … absorbed . \\n▁ ` ` i … oh , jase . '' \\n▁ i looked up into his eyes , half blinded by tears . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't save him , can i ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not with nature 's magic . '' \\n▁ he scrunched up the spell and tossed it over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` but it never hurt to try . '' \\n▁ i took a jagged breath , the air cooling the tears on my lips . \\n▁ ` ` arthur was right . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` i just … '' ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he cupped my cheek and rolled my face against his chest . \\n▁ and it hurt . \\n▁ it hurt to smell him , be this close to him . \\n▁ it reminded me too much of what would be gone soon , but also , deeper than any other feeling , made me miss him so terribly bad i just wanted to stay in his arms . \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' he said one more time , and i laughed into his shirt , half crying , and completely wetting it with tears . \\n▁ he leaned out a little and the smile he offered made the trees and grass seem yellow with warmth . \\n▁ ` ` hey , cheer up , m ` kay . \\n▁ we got a party to plan . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . \\n▁ this is a day for celebration . \\n▁ not tears . '' \\n▁ i wiped my face . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay now . '' \\n▁ ` ` you sure ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just … '' i nodded , sniffling . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` come on then . '' \\n▁ he stood and offered his hand . \\n▁ ` ` you can come with me to the cellar to get the wine . '' \\n▁ i placed my hand in his and pulled myself to stand . \\n▁ ` ` no , you go get the wine . \\n▁ i need to get changed . '' \\n▁ ` ` changed ? '' \\n▁ he appraised my outfit sceptically . \\n▁ ` ` you look fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` ugh . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` you are so not a girl , are you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um ? '' \\n▁ he looked down at his jeans . \\n▁ ` ` not last time i checked . '' \\n▁ vampire celebrations had a lot more class than human ones . \\n▁ as i trudged through the open field toward the lighthouse , i half expected to see a strobe light flashing - the only thing more noticeable than the bass - thumping tunes - and a bunch of drunk fools hanging off the railing on the top floor . \\n▁ so the gentle glow of candlelight emanating from small tea - lights in each of the six windows wrapping the giant tube , and the soft hum of mozart , was quite a pleasant surprise . \\n▁ i wiped my feet with a light scuff on the doormat and popped my head in , calling out to see if anyone was here yet . \\n▁ ` ` just us , so far . '' \\n▁ jason trotted down the stairs with two wineglasses in hand , his light blue shirt open a little at the neck , sitting snuggly over his denim jeans . \\n▁ i could just make out the dark lines of the tattooed band wrapping his arm through the fabric . \\n▁ he looked as sweetly sexy as jase always did , but instead of letting myself smile and tell him that , i appraised him critically . \\n▁ ` ` so even you got changed before the party . '' \\n▁ he looked down at his outfit and handed me a wineglass . \\n▁ ` ` could n't let you be the only pretty one . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i can do pretty without all the cologne and hair product . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey , do n't knock the hair . '' \\n▁ he ran a hand through it . \\n▁ ` ` took me hours to get it this perfect . '' \\n▁ ` ` liar . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , you got me . \\n▁ actually , it 's not hair product . \\n▁ it 's just wet . '' \\n▁ his open palm showed the moisture . \\n▁ ` ` i knew that , jase . \\n▁ i was teasing . '' \\n▁ i saluted with the glass , then peered in at the contents . \\n▁ ` ` it 's lemonade . '' \\n▁ he sipped through a smile . \\n▁ ` ` you know me well . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` besides , you 're not twenty - one yet . \\n▁ ca n't have you breaking the law . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i mean , what would the king say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` say ? \\n▁ nothing . '' \\n▁ he tapped his glass on mine . \\n▁ ` ` it 's what he 'd do that i worry about . '' \\n▁ ` ` he would n't care , you know . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you do n't know him very well . '' \\n▁ he laughed , prompting me to follow him up the stairs . \\n▁ the racket of footfalls on steel sounded odd because , while i could see my own feet and jason 's ahead of mine , there was only one set of echoes . \\n▁ he was so ridiculously light - footed he made me feel like an elephant . \\n▁ ` ` did emily say if she was coming ? '' \\n▁ i asked , hoping to drown out the evidence of my lead - foot . \\n▁ ` ` yes , and nate , and a few others , too . \\n▁ but it 'll be a pretty small gathering tonight , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve set out a picnic on the balcony . \\n▁ now we ' ve got that railing fixed right ` round the ledge , it 's a bit safer up there . '' \\n▁ ` ` sounds great . \\n▁ i hope you have cake . '' \\n▁ ` ` sweet tooth , huh ? '' \\n▁ he looked down at me from the step above . \\n▁ i bit my lip . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ kinda . '' \\n▁ ` ` thought you might say that , so - '' he stopped and i nearly bumped into him . \\n▁ ` ` i took the liberty of venturing into town today - bought you some chocolate . '' \\n▁ my tongue moved out of my mouth and across my lips involuntarily . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't had chocolate since i first moved here ! '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` hey guys , '' emily called , stuffing her phone in her back pocket as she came through the door . \\n▁ ` ` am i late ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just in time , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` come on up . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey , '' blade said casually , coming in behind em . \\n▁ ` ` did i miss any fun ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nah , emily only just got here . '' \\n▁ i winked at blade . \\n▁ ` ` what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n▁ em asked , her nose crinkling . \\n▁ ` ` you 're the fun one - of course , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , right . '' \\n▁ she started up the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure that 's what you meant . '' \\n▁ i huffed as she shoved past me , blade hot on her trail , then turned to jason . \\n▁ ` ` she thought i was being mean , did n't she ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ he squeezed my shoulder reassuringly . \\n▁ ` ` she just does n't know blade likes her yet . '' \\n▁ i looked up the stairs to the top . \\n▁ ` ` no kidding . '' \\n▁ conversations died down and the food dwindled to scraps , and by the time nate left , the only other people still hanging around were blade and em , arthur , jason , and i. and i liked it this way . \\n▁ it was peaceful and intimate - even if em was still holding a grudge for the nastiness she assumed i 'd expressed earlier . \\n▁ i was beginning to see what mike meant about her being so moody lately . \\n▁ ` ` how 's that sleeping potion coming along ? '' \\n▁ i asked arthur . \\n▁ he stood beside me , both of us leaning on the railing , our drinks in hand above the nothingness . \\n▁ ` ` why do you ask , my dear ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mike needs to extract more venom this week for the sword - tipping , and i do n't want him to do it awake . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll have it ready tomorrow , '' he said with a nod . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve made it a little stronger than last time . \\n▁ it seems mike has developed an immunity to it . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's an acclimation thing , '' jase said , appearing on my left . \\n▁ ` ` medicines and certain treatments very rarely work more than thrice on a vampire - of any kind . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow . \\n▁ i did n't know that . '' \\n▁ ` ` there is much to learn , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` but you have centuries to do so . '' \\n▁ i nodded and leaned a little more on my arm , blowing the warm air from my mouth over my cold hands . \\n▁ ` ` it 's breezy up here , is n't it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` are you ready to go back ? '' \\n▁ jason asked . \\n▁ ` ` i could walk you . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's okay . \\n▁ i 'll wait for blade . '' \\n▁ i jerked my head in his direction . \\n▁ ` ` falcon 's orders . '' \\n▁ jason nodded , leaning down on the railing , too , and angled his shoulders in so his head came closer to mine . \\n▁ ` ` did you see that ? '' \\n▁ all three of us turned our heads to the pair sitting with their legs dangling over the balcony ledge , shoulder - to - shoulder , whispering and giggling with each other . \\n▁ ` ` he just put his jacket on em , '' jason finished . \\n▁ ` ` does he know she does n't get cold ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i do , '' blade said , turning around . \\n▁ ` ` but it 's how i was raised . '' \\n▁ we all laughed , and emily just shrunk into herself a little more . \\n▁ ` ` you warm enough ? '' \\n▁ jason asked , reaching across to tighten the leather jacket around my chest again . \\n▁ i angled my chin so my nose went into the collar a bit . \\n▁ it smelled like him , and from the moment he put it around me earlier , i 'd felt like i wanted to cry . \\n▁ somehow , his scent conjured up some feeling - some emotion that should ' ve had an identifying thought to accompany it . \\n▁ but as my brain searched for that spark , that instant of recall , i was left blank ; carrying only the feeling that my heart was incredibly broken and that jase 's was too . \\n▁ but it was silly . \\n▁ so i brushed it off and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m lovely and warm , thanks . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome , '' he said , but his brows moved together in the middle , forming that line . \\n▁ i wanted to ask him to just spit it out - say what he was thinking . \\n▁ i knew he 'd read my mind just now . \\n▁ i knew he knew i knew something was amiss between us , and if arthur was n't here , i was sure jase would tell me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're very quiet tonight , amara , '' arthur noted , pinching my sleeve affectionately . \\n▁ ` ` is everything okay ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , brushing my head against his shoulder for a second . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . \\n▁ i just found out about my real mom today , is all . '' \\n▁ jason stood from his lean , and arthur hung his head a little lower . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you tell me , ara ? '' \\n▁ jason asked . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't even see that in your thoughts . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` guess i ' ve had other things on my mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ he swept me into his arms and held me against his chest for a second , cupping the back of my head with his ultra cold hand . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m a terrible friend . \\n▁ i should have - '' ` ` it 's not your fault , jase . '' \\n▁ i patted his chest and stood back . \\n▁ ` ` there was nothing really to tell . \\n▁ my mom died in childbirth , and my dad was killed in iraq . '' \\n▁ ` ` amara . '' \\n▁ arthur 's hand came down on my shoulder ; i turned around to face him . \\n▁ ` ` i am truly sorry . \\n▁ david and i had agreed to tell you in time , but - '' ` ` david did n't tell me , arthur . \\n▁ i called my dad . '' \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you tell me you knew ? '' \\n▁ jase asked . \\n▁ i looked back at him . \\n▁ ` ` because , in the same conversation where i told david i knew about my mom , i also told him about the headaches , and then he approved the lab . '' \\n▁ jason smiled , leaning on the railing again , and arthur and i followed suit . \\n▁ ` ` how 's things going at elysium ? '' \\n▁ arthur asked . \\n▁ ` ` have they worked their way through most of the prisoners now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm - hm . '' \\n▁ i sipped my drink as i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` but a few of them have to go to the mental asylum . '' \\n▁ arthur and jason exchanged glances . \\n▁ ` ` pepper inclusive , '' i probed , keeping my gaze on the horizon . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not surprised , '' arthur said , turning to lean his back on the rail . \\n▁ ` ` i saw her a year or so ago , and requested they move her then . '' \\n▁ ` ` why did n't they ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake denied the motion . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david was gone at the time . \\n▁ and … i guess drake saw it as a method of revenge for his defection , perhaps , '' arthur mused . \\n▁ my lip curled . \\n▁ ` ` that 's so cruel . '' \\n▁ ` ` he can be a cruel man . '' \\n▁ i looked up at arthur for a second and watched his blue eyes wander in thought . \\n▁ he looked younger when he was absent from his mind , his features so much softer and almost kind of sad looking . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you both think that , maybe it 's time for me to know what happened to her - to pepper ? '' \\n▁ i waited then , letting the idea sink in for them . \\n▁ ` ` clearly , i ' m not going to dump david if i find out he 's a masochistic torturer . '' \\n▁ i held up my ring hand . \\n▁ ` ` if i have n't left him yet , chances are , i ' m not going to . '' \\n▁ arthur smiled down at me , but when he looked at jase , he frowned . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ i caught the same vibe arthur had . \\n▁ jason bent down with a huge sigh and left his wineglass by his feet , standing back up again slowly . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right , ara . \\n▁ you should know . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' arthur said suggestively , his wide eyes arresting jason 's boyish confidence . \\n▁ ` ` she should really know everything , should n't she ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in good time , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll start with pepper , and see how we go from there . '' \\n▁ arthur seemed to agree , stepping back and offering the floor to jase while he went to grab another glass . \\n▁ ` ` they were in love , '' jase began . \\n▁ ` ` as much any two vampire souls had ever been , but david 's desperation to be a council member started to waver from the day he met pepper . \\n▁ he was missing meetings , failing to complete tasks , and staring in dreamy - eyed gazes when he should have been carrying out punishments . \\n▁ the last straw was when he set a prisoner free without torture . '' \\n▁ ` ` he set someone free ? '' \\n▁ i asked , nearly leaping over the balcony in disbelief . \\n▁ ` ` he was n't always as a harsh a man as he is now , '' arthur added , standing beside me again . \\n▁ ` ` so , what did the prisoner do , the one he set free ? \\n▁ was it a horrid crime ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 'd xxunk turned a human , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` and david quite simply said that he understood how love could madden a man and force him to do things he would n't normally do . '' \\n▁ i stared out to sea . \\n▁ ` ` that does n't sound like my david . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was n't the david any of us knew , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` he was even getting along - or trying to - get along with me . '' \\n▁ i smiled , rubbing jase 's arm , then turned my head to look at arthur . \\n▁ ` ` so pepper was a good influence on him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in ways . '' \\n▁ arthur nodded . \\n▁ ` ` well , enough that david had planned to ask her to marry him - '' ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he had the ring his grandmother passed down , '' arthur continued . \\n▁ ` ` and he 'd set the date and the time he would do it . '' \\n▁ ` ` but … '' i thought back to the day he told me about the one and only vampire he 'd ever wanted to marry . \\n▁ ` ` who was it ? '' \\n▁ jason asked , coming up off the railing just a little . \\n▁ ` ` who was what ? '' \\n▁ arthur asked , confused . \\n▁ ` ` ara was just thinking that david told her he 'd only ever wanted to be with one vampire , and it was n't pepper . '' \\n▁ ` ` who then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` morg , '' i said , my tone rising in question on the end . \\n▁ arthur and jason broke into a gusty fit of laughter . \\n▁ ` ` that is a big , fat lie , right there , '' jason said , failing to compose himself . \\n▁ ` ` they hated each other . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' arthur said , sobering a little . \\n▁ ` ` i suspect david told you it was morgaine so you would n't keep asking . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` well , it worked . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m surprised you did n't keep asking after that , anyway , '' jason said , leaning down again . \\n▁ ` ` he and morg are incredibly mismatched . '' \\n▁ ` ` i just figured it was in another time , you know , and that people change . '' \\n▁ jase wiped his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` not that much . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ so , what was pepper like then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she was a sweet thing , very much like you in a lot of ways . \\n▁ her hair was golden , her features petite , and she always seemed to be smiling , like nothing ever bothered her , '' arthur said fondly . \\n▁ ` ` i know she reminded david a lot of his aunt . '' \\n▁ ` ` and he was gon na ask her to marry him , right ? \\n▁ so , why did n't he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the night before he set off for his xxunk leave , drake called him to preside over one last case . '' \\n▁ arthur 's lips rolled inward , the memory travelling across his face , painting it with emotion . \\n▁ ` ` i saw the look in david 's eye , saw his heart break right there in a room full of people when pepper was bound and thrown to her knees before him like some petty thief . '' \\n▁ ` ` he did n't know she 'd been arrested ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ the way jason said that made me look at him . \\n▁ ` ` i was the one who arrested her . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was a warrior , ara . \\n▁ it was my job . '' \\n▁ ` ` who gave the order ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the king . '' \\n▁ ` ` i just … '' i rubbed my head . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't picture david sitting there and sentencing her to torture . \\n▁ i just ca n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was a grim scene and it was , in many ways , a test , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` he knew that . \\n▁ from the moment he looked into her eyes and then over at drake , david knew his next move would determine the fate of his career . '' \\n▁ ` ` he had to leave emotion out of it from there , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` he heard her pleas , heard her reasons for turning the child , and he suddenly went stone - faced , as if he cared nothing for her . '' \\n▁ ` ` because she broke the law , or because it affected a child ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no one really knows . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow . '' \\n▁ i toyed with the stem of my glass , then popped it on the floor by my feet . \\n▁ ` ` so , why does she haunt him so much ? \\n▁ i mean , i knew he sentenced her and that he 'd loved her , but what 's the big deal , really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the standard punishment for a vampire that turns a child is the hot tar , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` whereby the vampire is stripped naked and lowered into a vat of boiling tar , burned until their flesh peels from their body , then taken away to heal again , slowly , and without blood . '' \\n▁ ` ` once their skin is just pink again , '' jason said , ` ` they repeat the process . \\n▁ and this is done for the full term of the sentence . \\n▁ often three years . '' \\n▁ arthur nodded to confirm . \\n▁ ` ` however , drake was so disturbed by the fact that a council member 's own girl had broken such a law that he stepped in after the sentencing and added two months torture - to be carried out by soldiers during the day , and by david at night . '' \\n▁ ` ` but … what about his leave ? \\n▁ i thought he was - '' ` ` he was delayed by two months as punishment for not controlling his girl , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` wow . \\n▁ so … '' i pictured it all in my head , seeing the room i was taken to the day jason tortured me . \\n▁ ` ` he just did it : tortured her , like , happily ? '' \\n▁ ` ` certainly not , my dear . '' \\n▁ arthur exhaled , looking off at nothing for a few seconds , his face scrunched up tightly . \\n▁ ` ` every day , when he would return to his chamber after her torture , he would fall to his knees and pray for forgiveness . '' \\n▁ ` ` i found him once , '' jason said , his own gaze drifting off to thought . \\n▁ ` ` he was on his knees , his body rigid , eyes on the brink of tears . \\n▁ he said he could n't take any more . \\n▁ he said she cried his name out , begging him for mercy . \\n▁ i offered to trade places with him - be the one to do it so that he did n't have to suffer . \\n▁ no one would ' ve known it was me . \\n▁ but - '' ` ` but he refused ? '' \\n▁ i said , knowing why . \\n▁ he would never have let anyone else hurt someone he loved . \\n▁ which , i understood then , is why he was so quick to forgive jason for the same . \\n▁ ` ` i remember , one night , '' arthur added , ` ` i embraced him , tried to comfort him , and for the first time since he was a boy , he wrapped his arms around me and i heard him cry . \\n▁ nothing haunted me more than seeing tears from this boy who refused to cry for even the most heinous things . \\n▁ even the day his aunt died , he shed not one tear - that any of us saw , anyway . '' \\n▁ ` ` but despite that , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` he 'd dust himself off and go back down to that cell , because if he did n't do what the king asked , much worse would be ordered for the poor girl . '' \\n▁ ` ` what kind of torture did he … i mean … it must have been bad to haunt david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it was . '' \\n▁ arthur nodded . \\n▁ ` ` the final straw came one night when i found him in a corridor , his hands and face covered in blood - her blood - her golden hair tangled in long , broken threads around his fingers . \\n▁ i asked him what had happened , and he said she went mad . \\n▁ told me she just could n't take it anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` then … what was the hair and the blood from ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i asked the same thing . \\n▁ but he could n't speak . \\n▁ so , i went down to see the girl , attend to her medically , if needed - and found her huddled in the darkest corner , her eyes black , her body unclothed and bleeding . \\n▁ when i squatted down and inspected her closer , found her hair was torn in patches from her scalp - most of the skin missing from her upper thighs and wrists , peeled away , you might say , as if she 'd scratched it off with her own nails . '' \\n▁ ` ` what happened to her ? '' \\n▁ i asked , horrified . \\n▁ arthur looked away . \\n▁ ` ` david had found her in a similar state . \\n▁ he asked what had become of her , and a prisoner told how she 'd been quite brutally raped - had things done to her that no young girl could imagine possible . \\n▁ she 'd tried to tear the skin from her own body to wash off the horrors of what those men did to her , and when david came to comfort her , she attacked him , thinking he was one of them . '' \\n▁ ` ` the guards stepped in , ara , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` every prisoner knows that the punishment for attacking a council leader is a grave one , no matter what state of mind they 're in at the time . '' \\n▁ ` ` she was bound , '' arthur continued . \\n▁ ` ` thrashed with the guard 's belt while david watched on - bound himself by the laws he protected . \\n▁ when the lashings stopped , she laid there in a pool of her own blood , and before david could react , the guards grabbed her by the hair and … '' ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk her , '' jase said . \\n▁ i covered my mouth , knowing how david would react if that were me . \\n▁ ` ` david tried to fight them off , '' jason added . \\n▁ ` ` but it only made matters worse , and he was tangled up in the process , tearing half her hair away himself . '' \\n▁ ` ` the guards restrained him , '' arthur said , ` ` made him watch until the girl gave up screaming and just laid there sobbing his name . '' \\n▁ ` ` when they released david , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` he just turned away and walked from the cells like a ghost - went on leave the next day , and never spoke of her again . '' \\n▁ ` ` drake recommended a two - year stint in a high school - to live among those who have so few cares and worries , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` he figured a lighter occupation would do david good after such a harrowing ordeal . '' \\n▁ ` ` school ? \\n▁ he sent david to school after all that ? '' \\n▁ arthur nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and it did do him good . \\n▁ drake was right . \\n▁ we saw changes in david after just a few weeks . \\n▁ but , even then , everything that made that boy alive was dead . \\n▁ he was colder and harsher , and i worried for the young humans in his community . '' \\n▁ ` ` then he met you , '' jason said , smiling at something far away . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' arthur added , and the energy in the space changed , the daunting , horrible reality lifting away a little . \\n▁ ` ` after that , he returned to council meetings - smiled again . \\n▁ he was , you could say , more human than he 'd been since he was a boy . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you can imagine what you must mean to him , ara , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` that you were the very thing that gave him a reason to live again - to believe that life was n't a nightmare he could n't wake from . '' \\n▁ i thought back to everything we 'd been through , feeling a sense of dread for the time he walked away from us just to protect me from his world . \\n▁ and i was grateful to him for that now more than ever after everything pepper went through . \\n▁ he always said he could n't protect me from the horrors of his world , and this story explained so much more why the very mention of turning a child had sent him storming off to his room , slamming the door . \\n▁ i felt bad for even bringing it up now . \\n▁ ` ` god , i just wan na call him and tell him i ' m sorry for everything bad i ever said or did . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` poor guy . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and you can see now why , in my pursuit for revenge , i thought it so marvellous to steal you from him - by pain of heart or even death , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` wow , that was incredibly malicious , jase . '' \\n▁ i backhanded his arm . \\n▁ he rubbed it as if it hurt . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but , he knows i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` we all do . '' \\n▁ i nodded , looking out to sea , then just let it all out with a really long breath . \\n▁ ` ` wow . '' \\n▁ ` ` yep . '' \\n▁ jason leaned beside me again . \\n▁ ` ` wow . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll say , '' blade came to stand beside jason . \\n▁ ` ` that 's quite a story . '' \\n▁ ` ` he never told me that , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` i asked him once , but he would n't tell me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i can see why , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` i would n't either . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , now you know . '' \\n▁ arthur stood tall again . \\n▁ ` ` and i must warn you , amara , do not ever bring it up in front of him . \\n▁ do not ever seek to use it against him or to - '' ` ` i would n't do that , arthur . '' \\n▁ i crossed my heart . \\n▁ ` ` not even if i was mad with him . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i hope not . '' \\n▁ he bowed his head . \\n▁ ` ` because i could not vouch for the man you may see beneath this new david . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ i 'll never speak of it . \\n▁ i swear . '' \\n▁ ` ` see that you do n't , '' arthur said , and walked away . \\n▁ ` ` well , story time 's been fun , ara , '' blade said . \\n▁ ` ` but it 's time for bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i looked back at jase . \\n▁ he offered a sweet smile . \\n▁ ` ` night , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` night , jase . '' \\n▁ i went to take the jacket off and hand it to him , but he stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` keep it tonight . \\n▁ give it back tomorrow when you come see me for our first training session . '' \\n▁ i snuggled into the leather again . \\n▁ ` ` okay , what time ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sunrise . '' \\n▁ he flashed a mischievous . \\n▁ ` ` nah , just kidding . \\n▁ any time you like , sweet girl . \\n▁ i have xxrep 4 a xxrep 3 l day . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i nodded and walked past him with a big smile on my face . \\n▁ ` ` sunrise it is . '' \\n▁ ` ` see you then , '' he called . \\n▁ i started down the stairs , stopping for a sec to let emily catch up . \\n▁ ` ` cute , i ' m sure , '' she muttered coldly . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you and jase . '' \\n▁ she grabbed my arm . \\n▁ ` ` he likes you , you know - more than he should considering he 's your brother - in - law . '' \\n▁ blade came up between us . \\n▁ ` ` she knows , em . '' \\n▁ ` ` then why is she even hanging out with him ? '' \\n▁ blade and i made faces at each other - clear astonishment at em 's bitchiness . \\n▁ ` ` so , is that how it goes , em ? '' \\n▁ blade said . \\n▁ ` ` if you know someone likes you , you keep away from them ? '' \\n▁ ` ` would n't know . '' \\n▁ she stormed off ahead of us . \\n▁ ` ` no one 's ever liked me . '' \\n▁ blade stopped walking and looked at me , pouting for em . \\n▁ ` ` all that effort . '' \\n▁ i patted his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` and she still does n't have a clue , does she ? '' \\n▁ he started walking again with a bit of a lag to his step . \\n▁ ` ` guess not . '' \\n▁ ` ` you might just have to be upfront about your feelings , blade . '' \\n▁ ` ` to be honest , '' he said , the little laugh accentuating his xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m afraid she might slap me if i tell her . '' \\n▁ i chuckled . \\n▁ ` ` never know , you might enjoy a little slap . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll give you a little slap , '' he said , threatening my bottom . \\n▁ i elbowed him in the ribs softly and we left the lighthouse behind , but i turned back and caught a wave from the blue - shirt - wearing vampire standing on the balcony before we blended with the darkness . \\n▁ chapter ten she opened her eyes , the blue appearing before her lashes even parted , but as an instant smile swept her lips when she saw me , so too did the memory of what just happened . \\n▁ she turned away . \\n▁ ` ` do n't look at me like that , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ i jumped up sat beside her . \\n▁ ` ` like you 're really concerned . '' \\n▁ i was really concerned , i thought , but it was n't my thought . \\n▁ i reached across and gently smoothed my thumb down her soft skin , seeing the moment in her mind when that barbarian struck her . \\n▁ it was n't a hard hit , it was n't even hard enough to change the colour of her skin , but it scared her , shocked her , and in that instant , a part of their friendship died . \\n▁ i could feel that pain . \\n▁ i had good reason to be concerned . \\n▁ she knew that . \\n▁ ` ` he hit you , '' i said , but the words , the feelings that came with them were n't mine , either . \\n▁ they were jason 's . \\n▁ ` ` it was a tiny slap , '' she said , pulling my hand away . \\n▁ ` ` and i kinda had it coming . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i almost regurgitated the words , gasping them out instead . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve been through enough . \\n▁ he had no right to touch you that way . \\n▁ i will skin him alive . '' \\n▁ the anger i felt in jason then moved me outside his body , but i heard everything , saw everything the way he saw it in what was obviously a dream he was having - all the way down on the second floor , tucked up tightly in his bed . \\n▁ so i watched , because something in this dream felt familiar somehow , like i 'd lived it before . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay , '' ara said softly , cocking her head as though she felt sorry for me . \\n▁ it felt strange to have jason 's voice in my head as if it were mine . \\n▁ it felt kind of disorienting . \\n▁ i sat back a little and just pretended he was telling the story , almost as if i were reading a book that suddenly switched perspective mid - chapter . \\n▁ ` ` but you should n't be . \\n▁ you should n't brush this off like it does n't matter , ara . \\n▁ he is ten times bigger than you , and he - '' ` ` i ' ve got bigger things to worry about right now , jase . '' \\n▁ she rolled away , pulling the blanket up over her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` just let it go . '' \\n▁ my hands hovered over her body for a second , tight , almost grabbing . \\n▁ i wanted to shake her - just dive into her head and insert all my own experiences and lessons so she 'd wake up and smell the damn roses . \\n▁ but i pressed my fingers firmly to the side of her head , sweeping her hair back instead . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , ara . \\n▁ i wo n't let this go . '' \\n▁ i kissed her face , backing off . \\n▁ ` ` but we 'll talk about it in the morning . '' \\n▁ there was no point trying to make her see reason tonight . \\n▁ she was as stubborn as an ox when she thought she was right , and while this was an endearing trait most of the time , it was also downright dangerous . \\n▁ it would take time to make her see that her so - called best friend was in the wrong . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` shh . '' \\n▁ i tucked the blanket around her firmly , hoping it 'd keep her there , wrapped up safe so i would n't be tempted to lecture her . \\n▁ ` ` just sleep . '' \\n▁ but she rolled over and shoved the blanket back . \\n▁ ` ` let it go . \\n▁ mike did n't mean to do that . \\n▁ he 's … i mean , look what i put him through . \\n▁ this was just the final straw , okay . \\n▁ he clearly ca n't take any more of , well , me . '' \\n▁ dear god . \\n▁ her ability to see the good in everything had finally become a hazard . \\n▁ i lowered my head into my hands . \\n▁ ` ` i understand that , ara , probably better than you might think , but he 's not just your friend anymore . \\n▁ he 's the head of security . \\n▁ no matter what you do or have done , he should have more self - control than to have slapped you . '' \\n▁ surely she could at least see that much reason . \\n▁ ` ` it was a little tap . '' \\n▁ i looked up from behind my hands . \\n▁ ` ` you 're kidding me , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` jase . \\n▁ go to bed . \\n▁ you look tired . '' \\n▁ a pattern of thought started in her head then . \\n▁ i could n't grasp it enough to see what she was thinking , but i knew she was right about my appearance . \\n▁ i had n't slept well since the masquerade . \\n▁ i 'd slept even less since i tortured her , and while i was fine with that , since it felt like some kind of penance , the tiredness was affecting my self - control , decision making , even self - respect , making it hard to maintain grasp on this ever - weaving web of lies and corruption going on around us while simultaneously practicing honourable intentions toward ara . \\n▁ ` ` i am tired , '' i said simply . \\n▁ ` ` did you sleep at all last night ? '' \\n▁ and there it was : the thought she 'd started but had n't finished . \\n▁ it came to life in her mind like a memory ; me , the screaming , the night she came down the corridor to see arthur leaving my room after administering some hefty drug to stop the night terrors . \\n▁ she 'd imagined me in there - imagined herself beside me , holding me . \\n▁ she wanted to be there . \\n▁ but if i let her in , if i let her know i was suffering for what i did to her , she would n't let this go . \\n▁ she would n't let me suffer for that . \\n▁ ` ` what would make you think i had n't slept ? '' \\n▁ i asked , planting the idea in her mind to just drop this . \\n▁ ` ` you know already , jase , you can read my mind . '' \\n▁ she touched my arm , yanking me back from the invasion on her brain . \\n▁ ` ` how long have you been having those night terrors ? '' \\n▁ i studied her carefully , wanting to let her in , knowing she could help , but at the same time knowing i did n't deserve it . \\n▁ then again , she would n't drop this . \\n▁ she 'd lay awake all night , worrying , and probably end up coming to my room in the small hours , getting caught by falcon then having david breathe down her neck because he does n't trust her . \\n▁ she would n't let this go unless i either talked to her about it or did something to her brain , which i did n't want to do . \\n▁ ` ` you … so you did see that dream ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ i sunk back , exhaling , as if i did n't know . \\n▁ ` ` are they always that bad , the dreams ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ i sat up , feeling my heart come away from my chest in a hot spill of blood . \\n▁ ` ` ara , please do n't - just … do n't say you 're sorry . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i ' m the one who - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she grabbed my hand and pressed it to her chest , right over the silver locket my brother gave her as a representation of his love . \\n▁ i wanted to pull away , but she 'd never held me like that before . \\n▁ ` ` all of that 's in the past , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` i know what you did for me . \\n▁ i know it was to protect me , jase , i forgave you a very , very long time ago . '' \\n▁ and she had . \\n▁ i 'd seen that in her eyes , her thoughts . \\n▁ it was one of the first things i noticed when we met in the field the day i returned from the dead . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you do n't . \\n▁ it hurts me for you to feel such deep regret . \\n▁ you 're punishing yourself for something you had no control over . '' \\n▁ she was right . \\n▁ but it was n't just the torture at elysium that bothered me - it was the pain i 'd caused when i did have control . \\n▁ i drew my hand away . \\n▁ ` ` i just … '' ` ` jase . \\n▁ it 's . \\n▁ in . \\n▁ the . \\n▁ past , '' she said , slowly and deliberately . \\n▁ ` ` stop dreaming about it . '' \\n▁ ` ` to do that , i 'd have to stop sleeping . '' \\n▁ she rolled her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` how ` bout you come visit me in our sleep again instead . \\n▁ we 'll make some nice dreams for you . '' \\n▁ instant reaction ? \\n▁ lay her down and enter her head right now . \\n▁ common sense reaction ? \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure it 's really appropriate for us to be alone like that , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but i ca n't have you reliving that torture every night . \\n▁ i wo n't . '' \\n▁ all very well , but what was she going to do about it ? \\n▁ ` ` not to mention , '' she continued . \\n▁ ` ` if i ' m slipping into your dreams somehow , i do n't really want to be seeing that every time i close my eyes , either . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ it was n't really funny , but she was right . \\n▁ she and i , we had a connection like no others in this manor . \\n▁ what i suffered , so too did she . \\n▁ i guess , in that sense alone , i owed it to her to be all right again . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ no more nightmares then . '' \\n▁ ` ` good , '' she said in a businesslike tone , and i just wanted to kiss her . \\n▁ she always had a way of making me feel better . \\n▁ ` ` now , '' she added . \\n▁ ` ` i have question for you . '' \\n▁ oh no . \\n▁ ` ` shoot . '' \\n▁ ` ` the mind - links ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm ? '' \\n▁ ` ` did … '' she tried not to smile . \\n▁ ` ` did you visit me in our dreams while you were supposedly dead ? '' \\n▁ the smile i started by seeing hers grew . \\n▁ i knew what she was about to ask . \\n▁ ` ` maybe . \\n▁ once or twice . '' \\n▁ ` ` i knew it . '' \\n▁ she slapped the covers , and her mind went from our adventures in the field to the night i came to her room and danced with her . \\n▁ ` ` so … the yellow dress ? '' \\n▁ i was n't sure if i should admit this . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i. . . '' \\n▁ i shrugged dismissively . \\n▁ ` ` i figured i owed you a new dress - since i ruined the blue one . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha ! \\n▁ i ca n't believe you just said that . '' \\n▁ neither could i. ` ` and , what about the memories ? '' \\n▁ she said . \\n▁ ` ` did you leave mind - blocks in place , or were you actually in those dreams with me , showing me all those things yourself ? '' \\n▁ ` ` many of those were memories of things we did before … '' the pictures of my childhood - the things she 'd asked me about , things i 'd shown her in our life together before i let her fall into drake 's hands came to mind , so clear , so intense with the love we have for each other that i almost forgot i was talking . \\n▁ ` ` i never placed mind - blocks . \\n▁ i erased those things , but only enough to hide them from a human mind . \\n▁ as you grew stronger , your brain lifted the sheet . '' \\n▁ you were never supposed to find those memories again , i added without saying it . \\n▁ ` ` sheet ? \\n▁ but you said you erased them . '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing can ever truly be erased from a mind . \\n▁ it 's like a hard drive - unless you have some pretty high - tech equipment , there 's always an imprint left behind . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ so , all those things you showed me about your childhood - '' ` ` you asked . \\n▁ i answered . '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` did you want me to hate david ? '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ of course i did . \\n▁ i just did n't want her to learn the hard way what kind of man he was . \\n▁ ` ` it 'd be nice if you did . \\n▁ but , no . \\n▁ i did and do want you to know what he 's like , though . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ her soft cheeks dropped as her lips sat parted , curiosity lingering beneath a hint of fear for the truth i might offer . \\n▁ she was so perfectly beautiful , so soft and so fragile . \\n▁ i could n't imagine how anyone could have slapped her . \\n▁ and then i remembered again - the way i hit her , the way i screamed at her , threw her , dragged her , hurt her , and made her cry . \\n▁ i 'd stepped outside myself when i did that , but no matter how far you step away , when you come back , the truth will always belong to you , and you can not escape your own memories . \\n▁ i feared for her and her loving soul . \\n▁ she forgave me for an act of depraved cruelty . \\n▁ i knew she 'd forgive mike , and i knew , if david ever slapped her , or locked her away in her room or forced her to wear the clothes he saw fit , she would accept that . \\n▁ she loved him enough to look past anything . \\n▁ ` ` you have such a forgiving heart that , well , now i ' m sure you 'd forgive david if he struck you in anger , and his strike would not be a tiny slap . '' \\n▁ ` ` you only say that because you think i ' m going to let mike get away with it . '' \\n▁ she would . \\n▁ ` ` no , i say that because my brother can seem to do no wrong . \\n▁ i ' ve seen him raise his voice at you , and you only blame yourself - tell yourself not to push him . \\n▁ ara , that 's a recipe for a submissive nineteen - fifties abused housewife . \\n▁ i just do n't want to see you crying on a kitchen floor , punished because the xxunk sunk and , sweet girl , i would n't put it past him . '' \\n▁ because i remembered too clearly the events of days gone by - stories i could never share for fear of breaking her heart - breaking the mould she thought david fitted . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't think very highly of him , do you ? '' \\n▁ she said , but what she really wanted to say was , you 're just behaving like a jealous brother . \\n▁ ` ` i love my brother . \\n▁ i do . \\n▁ but i know him , inside and out , and he 's old - fashioned . \\n▁ he does n't see anything wrong with disciplining his wife . \\n▁ it 's not a personality fault ; it 's a time corruption . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 'd never hit me , jase . '' \\n▁ i wiped my thumb down her cheek , right where mike would never have hit her either . \\n▁ ` ` neither would mike . '' \\n▁ she pushed my hand away . \\n▁ ` ` and david would never even do that much . '' \\n▁ ` ` i hope not . \\n▁ and i hope , if he ever does , you would come to me . \\n▁ you would see it as an error on his part , and not just think yourself the problem . '' \\n▁ ` ` i would n't . \\n▁ okay ? '' \\n▁ but she knew she would ; she knew she 'd take it to her grave because , if he ever struck her in anger , it would be so apparently out of character for him that people would ask what she 'd done to provoke him . \\n▁ ` ` i know it might seem like i let him get away with being all controlling and forceful , but if he ever did anything to me that i did n't like , i 'd leave . \\n▁ i have a no - strike policy with men , jase . \\n▁ if he hits me , even once , he 's gone , because that 's not love . '' \\n▁ then how could she love me ? \\n▁ ` ` i hit you , '' i said , and her mind went blank with guilt ; she had n't thought of that , but my point was made . \\n▁ and made strong . \\n▁ ` ` jase . \\n▁ do n't . \\n▁ okay ? \\n▁ just stop feeling guilty . \\n▁ look - '' she could n't find the right words , no matter how hard she tried , because she knew , deep down inside , that it was true ; i hurt her . \\n▁ she should have expelled me from her life a long time ago for that . \\n▁ ` ` okay , you hit me , you 're a bastard . \\n▁ i hate you . '' \\n▁ her lovely white teeth showed with that special grin she did only when she was being cheeky . \\n▁ her fangs had grown with the blood of the immortal being constant in her veins now , and they looked so cute on her ; so small they were almost like baby teeth . \\n▁ i loved her so much in that moment that the tears i 'd held all night , from the first moment i found out what she was planning to do with my uncle , came out from hiding . \\n▁ i did n't want her to see them . \\n▁ i swiped one away as it fell onto my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` you were just so small and precious . '' \\n▁ i could n't stop it then ; the whole thing played out in my mind , forcing me to see the way arthur touched her . \\n▁ to see her cry and throw up , and as my heart raged with fury , wishing i could skin my uncle , the memory of her face when i struck her , when i tortured her , came rushing back like a punishment . \\n▁ i broke . \\n▁ i had to tell her how i felt . \\n▁ i knew it would only make her pity me . \\n▁ but i needed her to know i never stopped regretting it . \\n▁ ` ` every strike felt as if you 'd snap , shatter , like porcelain . \\n▁ i - '' i held my hands out as if she was in them , broken , crying for me . \\n▁ i could see her there - see her in my arms . \\n▁ ` ` i hit as softly as i possibly could , but i - '' her fingertips landed in mine , bringing me back , waking me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't go there anymore . \\n▁ just , when you think about it , go to a place where we were happy , instead . '' \\n▁ there were so many places like that ; more memories of joy than pain . \\n▁ i flipped my hand over and held hers , knowing it was wrong , but owning her for myself in that moment , despite morals . \\n▁ ` ` only if i can take you there with me . '' \\n▁ her tiny fingers tightened around mine . \\n▁ ` ` i will go anywhere , do anything to make you okay again . \\n▁ it kills me that you 're stuck in that torture without me , jase . \\n▁ i ' m okay . \\n▁ i ' m here . \\n▁ i ' m alive , and i. . . '' \\n▁ i knew what she wanted to say . \\n▁ i saw her reach out in her mind and tell me she loved me , but she did n't say it . \\n▁ ` ` i care about you . \\n▁ a lot , '' she said instead . \\n▁ ` ` so , please , just … just do n't go back there anymore . \\n▁ move on . \\n▁ leave it behind where it belongs : in the past . '' \\n▁ in her mind , as she mentioned the past , she saw a future ; she pictured it for a second , with me . \\n▁ her and i , together , someday , somewhere . \\n▁ but she pulled the thought back , discarding it quickly , because she knew she loved david . \\n▁ but it was enough to cheer me up , just the hope of one day , maybe , making her mine . \\n▁ and suddenly , i found a new reason to live . \\n▁ ` ` see - '' i shuffled closer , tucking her hair behind her ear to reveal her beautiful face . \\n▁ ` ` this is why i love you . \\n▁ look how easily you can heal my heart . \\n▁ see how effortless it is for you to take my terrors away . '' \\n▁ she was everything i 'd ever dreamed of , and my deepest regret then was not finding her first . \\n▁ ` ` i just … i do n't know where i 'd be if i 'd not found you . '' \\n▁ she laughed . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ i had n't meant to add that bit ; it just slipped out , leaving me scrambling for an explanation , knowing it would open my heart to her . \\n▁ ` ` no one has ever cared so much before - to want to take my pain away and see that i dream of things that do n't leave scars when i wake . '' \\n▁ her delicate touch stroked my cheek , making me wish i could bear to look away from her perfection for one second just to close my eyes and enjoy the way she felt . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry you never found a girl who would see you the way i do . '' \\n▁ she just did n't get it . \\n▁ ` ` but i did find one . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ she smiled , but it was completely ruined by the pity in her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` but , i want you to have love , like david and i do . \\n▁ i want you to find your eternal person . '' \\n▁ ` ` eternal person ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` well , i found her . \\n▁ i ' m just waiting for her to realize we were made for each other , then i get my happy ending . '' \\n▁ she pulled away . \\n▁ ` ` that wo n't happen . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i looked into my lap , holding on to the last of that future i 'd seen with her . \\n▁ ` ` but eternity is a very long time . \\n▁ i can hope that , one day , you 'll feel the way i do . '' \\n▁ or at least admit it . \\n▁ ` ` if you really do care for me , then you wo n't think like that . \\n▁ because , for all the confusion i have in my heart , i only want david . '' \\n▁ she was right . \\n▁ it was selfish of me to hope she 'd fall out of love with david because , for that to happen , he would have to hurt her pretty badly . \\n▁ i took a deep breath and let it out . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ then i hope you never love me . \\n▁ i hope you and david live eternally happy lives together . '' \\n▁ ` ` liar . '' \\n▁ we both laughed . \\n▁ it was kind of irritating to have a person who could read me almost as well as i could read others . \\n▁ but nice at the same time . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m trying , ara . \\n▁ i do want what 's best for you . \\n▁ and if that 's my brother , then , in my heart , he 's who i want you to be with . '' \\n▁ even if i will eventually have to kill myself just to ease the pain . \\n▁ ` ` then you should stop touching me like your girlfriend . \\n▁ if he saw that , he 'd be really pissed . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i know . '' \\n▁ i sat back , sliding my hands slowly away from her body to savour the last touch . \\n▁ ` ` sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ it was n't okay . \\n▁ i needed some distance . \\n▁ she was n't wearing anything but a shirt under that sheet , and the instinct - driven man inside me knew that only too well . \\n▁ i moved away and sat on the chair again . \\n▁ ` ` hey , can i ask you something ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you demand i give your ring back ? '' \\n▁ she frowned . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know that was an option . '' \\n▁ i scoffed . \\n▁ how was it not ? \\n▁ ` ` ara , you never sit by and let things happen if you do n't approve . \\n▁ if you wanted that ring , you 'd have stomped your foot until i gave it to you . \\n▁ so , why did n't you ? '' \\n▁ she stared at me , realizing it for the first time herself . \\n▁ she did n't want it back . \\n▁ ` ` you 're reading into it too much . '' \\n▁ ` ` am i ? '' \\n▁ i grabbed the ring from my pocket and pressed it into her palm , folding her fingers around it . \\n▁ ` ` or are you just not telling me what you really think ? '' \\n▁ she slipped the ring back on her finger and rolled away from me , hating herself for the truth she 'd just admitted inside . \\n▁ ` ` go away , jason . \\n▁ you do n't know anything about me . '' \\n▁ but i did . \\n▁ i knew i should n't have forced her to see that truth so soon . \\n▁ she was n't ready . \\n▁ ` ` oh , do n't know anything about you , huh ? '' \\n▁ luckily , i also knew how to cheer her up . \\n▁ i pulled the blanket away from her . \\n▁ ` ` i know your ticklish spot . '' \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ she squealed , jerking around as i dug my fingers into her ribs . \\n▁ ` ` stop ! '' \\n▁ i laughed aloud , feeling pure joy for one of the first times in so long . \\n▁ it was the way she laughed - such a sweet little giggle , so honest and so unguarded . \\n▁ i could see why my brother loved it so much . \\n▁ she was just so beautifully innocent . \\n▁ i did n't want her to stop , so i kept tickling , gentle enough not to hurt her but firm enough to hold her down a little so she could n't get away . \\n▁ not that she wanted to get away . \\n▁ she looked up and her heart burned with love for me . \\n▁ this was exactly where we both wanted to be , no matter what the consequence . \\n▁ ` ` see ? '' \\n▁ i pinned both hands beside her face and leaned right down , pretending to be puffed out , knowing how much she loved it when i played human . \\n▁ ` ` i know more about you than anyone else in this world , ara - rose . \\n▁ and i know you did n't ask me for that ring because you liked the fact that i had it . \\n▁ you liked knowing how it made me feel to carry it , as if i owned a part of you my brother never would . '' \\n▁ ` ` what part ? '' \\n▁ all of you . \\n▁ your heart , soul , mind , body - future . \\n▁ ` ` the truth . '' \\n▁ she went completely stiff under me . \\n▁ that was all i needed to say , and her mind would fill in the rest . \\n▁ i tried not to laugh . \\n▁ as i moved to kneel back , the warmth off her body - from between her legs - brushed my knee . \\n▁ she was naked beneath this shirt . \\n▁ i knew i should n't look , but my eyes slowly strayed down her waist , past her hips , stopping there where the shirt rose up past her belly button . \\n▁ she let me look . \\n▁ she laid there , legs slightly apart , me kneeling between them , and for that second , she let me look . \\n▁ i held my breath . \\n▁ everything in the room getting hotter , including ara . \\n▁ she patterned it out in her thoughts ; me and her , making love . \\n▁ the thought stayed small enough that she did n't even know she thought it , but it was enough to send my heart and my blood into overdrive . \\n▁ i quickly let go of her hand and pulled the shirt down , catching a glimpse of the horror she felt when she remembered arthur being right where i was . \\n▁ ` ` what happened down there tonight , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` where ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in the training hall . \\n▁ why were you down there - practically naked ? '' \\n▁ although i already knew the truth , i just wanted her to tell me , but she was n't going to , until her thoughts did . \\n▁ i swept her hair off her brow , frowning , pretending i did n't already know . \\n▁ ` ` whoa . \\n▁ ara , you ' ve got ta be kidding me . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ she pretended , too - that she did n't know what i 'd just seen . \\n▁ the games we play . \\n▁ ` ` that 's what you were doing down there tonight ? \\n▁ arthur ? \\n▁ really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ she blinked a few extra times , pretending again . \\n▁ but i could play this game as long as she wanted . \\n▁ ` ` you saw that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sweet girl , i saw everything . '' \\n▁ i rested back on my knees , placing my hand to her thigh , my thumb discreetly holding the shirt to cover her so it would n't move if she did . \\n▁ ` ` so that 's what the dagger 's for - that 's what david wants it for ? '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's why he has n't been coming to see me . '' \\n▁ she grabbed that damn locket and held it tight . \\n▁ ` ` he ca n't bear it . \\n▁ he 's wanted to tell me so badly , but he knows i 'll fight him on it . \\n▁ he 's planning to just disappear . '' \\n▁ and the game was over . \\n▁ i might have known in her thoughts what she planned to do with my uncle , but this was the first time i 'd seen that - seen the pain it caused her , seen the devastation she felt because she knew she could n't betray david that way and , in that , she would be sending him to his death . \\n▁ how was that possibly her fault ? \\n▁ i landed on top of her , our noses in line . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , what ? '' \\n▁ i just did n't know what to say . \\n▁ no , i wo n't let you suffer . \\n▁ no , i wo n't let you blame yourself . \\n▁ no , i will not , over my dead body , see you sleep with my uncle to save david . \\n▁ i would rather die . \\n▁ i would rather be tortured at my brother 's hands for eternity . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i wo n't let this happen . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not letting you do this to yourself . '' \\n▁ i knew what i had to do . \\n▁ i knew she knew it too . \\n▁ without even thinking , i reached down and unfastened her buttons - my uncle 's buttons . \\n▁ i needed her out of this shirt , his scent off her beautiful body . \\n▁ it was almost enough to make me gag . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't see you suffer my uncle 's touch then hate yourself for the rest of eternity . '' \\n▁ ` ` i have to . '' \\n▁ she stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't lose david . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you can lose me , '' i said , and rolled the shirt off her shoulder , seeing her perfect white skin in a completely different light to ever before . \\n▁ i could n't think about the fact that she was okay with that - that , as i said it , she realised what i was going to do and accepted it , because she could accept my death before she could accept david 's . \\n▁ i pushed the thought aside , breaking to tears beneath the external strength . \\n▁ i owed her this . \\n▁ i owed her my pain - knew how it would feel to know that , as i laid between her legs , she would n't be making love to me , but fighting for him . \\n▁ ` ` jase - '' she saw it , though . \\n▁ she saw the hurt in my eyes . \\n▁ her hand slowly came up along my face , and i just wanted to fold into her , cry , tell her i love her , tell her to let him die . \\n▁ let him go . \\n▁ and you and i will be happy forever . \\n▁ together . \\n▁ ` ` if you father the heir , you 'll be going to your death . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` precisely . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would you want that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't know ? '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` you really have no idea what you are to me , ara , do you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ so she knew i loved her , but that was it . \\n▁ she could n't fathom the depths i would go to for her . \\n▁ and i just did n't know how to explain it , how to make her see that i would burn in a fire , drown myself in acid , peel my skin back and suffer for eternity to save her from one tear . \\n▁ ` ` it would take a lifetime for me to show you how i feel . \\n▁ there are no words i could find to say it in one breath , and i love you just does n't hold enough weight for the feeling i have in my soul that you are everything . \\n▁ you are my life , my breath , my reason to get up , to smile , to live each day . \\n▁ i will never let you go . '' \\n▁ i touched her soft , rose - petal skin for what might be the last time . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you see ? \\n▁ one day my brother will come back here , and i wo n't get to be with you anymore and , eventually , that will kill me anyway . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , jase . '' \\n▁ her pretty lip quivered . \\n▁ ` ` how can i live in a world without you ? '' \\n▁ she knew the answer to that . \\n▁ she did n't need to ask . \\n▁ i tore the shirt gently away from her body and tossed it as far from here as it would fly out that balcony door . \\n▁ she was waiting for me to answer , unaware or uncaring that she was completely and finally naked beneath me . \\n▁ she stared up , her eyes so full of questions ; so blue with sadness that i knew i had to answer her . \\n▁ ` ` better than you can live in a world without david . '' \\n▁ and she broke . \\n▁ she may have known it before , but she only admitted it then , in that second , and she cried . \\n▁ it was only for a moment - only a few sobs before she stopped and looked up at me , seeing my shirt come away , and pressed her hand to my stomach . \\n▁ ` ` wait . '' \\n▁ i looked down at this fragile , sweet girl below me , her milk white skin against the cream sheets , her dark hair , like silk ribbons , spilling out around her face and over the pillow . \\n▁ her eyes , like sapphires , the pupils so dark and so large with the heat of desire , forced an intake of breath in me - a pause to make this a memory - hold it in my heart for just a while longer . \\n▁ ` ` will david really hate me if i have a baby to stop him from dying ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 'll get over it . '' \\n▁ i ditched my shirt to the end of the bed and fell on my hands over her body , keeping mine off hers enough that i could maintain control of my emotions . \\n▁ ` ` think of the agony he 's been going through these past few months , probably worrying whose hands he 'd be leaving you in once he 's dead . '' \\n▁ like mine . \\n▁ it was better this way . \\n▁ he would , eventually , forgive me , and her . \\n▁ i grabbed her hips and slid her down under me so she was in perfect line . \\n▁ ` ` he knows this will happen , he just believes it 'll be when he 's gone , cold in the ground . \\n▁ but it does n't have to be that way . '' \\n▁ her mind went white with surprise ; she thought i 'd rather see her suffer the pain of losing him so i could have her for myself . \\n▁ she was dead wrong . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i said , answering that thought , even though i knew she hated it when i did that . \\n▁ ` ` not sad - not eternally grieving him , ara . \\n▁ if you really do love him more than me , then you will not ever be happy again if he dies . '' \\n▁ i reached down and unzipped my jeans . \\n▁ ` ` we 're doing this . \\n▁ i ' m giving you my child , and i will die happy , knowing that i at least left a part of myself behind - in you . '' \\n▁ she did n't have anything to say . \\n▁ i waited for a second to see if she wanted to back out . \\n▁ but she did n't . \\n▁ she wanted this . \\n▁ she wanted my death . \\n▁ she wanted him . \\n▁ i pulled my jeans past my hips , floating off the bed for a second while i yanked them away with my boots and socks inside the legs , and as the air touched my skin , my knees , my thighs , it came with the warmth off her beautiful body . \\n▁ i felt as if our skin was touching before i even fell back down between her legs . \\n▁ and as i laid myself there , where only my brother should be , her thoughts changed . \\n▁ i expected her to be tense , unwilling , maybe even push me away , but she looked up , and her heart beat once , steadying itself , her soul crying out inside her for this to happen , making her eyes electric blue - the static in her fingers charge everything with energy . \\n▁ she wanted me . \\n▁ not him . \\n▁ not mike . \\n▁ me . \\n▁ and i was going to take full advantage of that . \\n▁ she would be the last girl i ever loved before i died , and i wanted to enjoy her as if she was mine . \\n▁ so many things i always dreamed of doing to her - so many things i had one last chance to do . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , but … while i have you completely naked , i ' m gon na do something i ' ve wanted to do for a long time . '' \\n▁ her eyes went to my lips , as if she knew what i was thinking . \\n▁ ` ` what 's that ? '' \\n▁ i sent her an image of my plan , raising my brows . \\n▁ ` ` kiss you somewhere naughty . '' \\n▁ her mouth popped open in obvious shock , and i laughed as i moved down on the bed , tracing every one of her perfect curves with my lips on the way . \\n▁ i stopped above her ribs , where the cursive line of her promise remained from her walk of faith . \\n▁ ` ` this , '' i said , kissing the mark , ` ` looks incredibly sexy on you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure i fit in a sentence with the word sexy , '' she scoffed . \\n▁ ` ` tell that to my body . '' \\n▁ her cheeks flushed with the idea of what she might make me feel - little , plain , ordinary , unattractive ara - her too - thin body under this man who was cute and carefree , with a sexy tattoo around his firm arm and a tanned chest bigger than her husband 's . \\n▁ she compared herself to emily in that breath , wondering if i thought emily had a better body , or if i even compared them - or if i 'd ever even slept with emily . \\n▁ i had n't . \\n▁ i wanted to laugh . \\n▁ she just had no idea - could not conceive the depth of my want for her - how i loved her , needed her , purely because she was my ara . \\n▁ fat , thin , short hair , no hair , zits or warts or scars . \\n▁ i loved her . \\n▁ i wanted her flat against me so badly i could n't exhale the tightness in my chest away . \\n▁ she could feel the heat coming off me , but she could n't feel the intensity - the way the lust burned through me worse than the fire that melted my skin in my 1942 plane crash . \\n▁ i was harder than i 'd ever been , more wanting than i ever wanted to be again , and as my lips went past that permanent tan line above her absent undies and onto the soft patch of hair between her legs , she flooded , too : heat and moisture spilling against my lips like melting chocolate . \\n▁ my brother clearly had never done this to her before , and as my tongue slipped inside , like she was some soft , ripe fruit , tasting the milky smooth sweetness of this girl i 'd loved for so , so long , she moaned , crying out my name . \\n▁ my name . \\n▁ i 'd brought her heartache and pain . \\n▁ i 'd damaged her body , her soul , but as i gently slipped my finger inside , reaching up to where the muscles tightened , i was finally the one bringing her pleasure . \\n▁ her spine arched , pushing her closer to my mouth , and i worried for a second that the stubble on my chin might scratch her , but as i checked her thoughts , she clearly did n't mind . \\n▁ her legs parted further and she held her breath , trying to be quiet but not really succeeding , and each time i rubbed that delicate spot then kissed her gently after , she wanted to shake inside , not sure whether to laugh , cry , squirm or run . \\n▁ i saw a flash of blue spark her fingertips as i looked up for second , but she pinned her hands under her pillow , hiding it . \\n▁ and my mind raced with questions . \\n▁ for some reason , that spark caused no pain , no shock when it flared in this situation . \\n▁ i felt it warm her toes against the bottoms of my legs , but it did n't hurt - not one bit . \\n▁ ` ` what 's funny ? '' \\n▁ i asked when she giggled . \\n▁ ` ` that kind of tickles . '' \\n▁ i laughed , pressing my wet lips into her belly , moving firm kisses over each rib , all the way up to her br * * sts . \\n▁ they were so soft , so full , fit so perfectly into my hands , and i wanted to tell her that i 'd never seen such purity in a girl - the pale pink of her nipple , the way it set so softly into her milk - white skin , like she was some kind of angel or white blossom i had plucked from the garden of eden . \\n▁ i traced a gentle line around it and let my tongue follow , drawing the fullness into my mouth for one sweet kiss before burying my face in her jaw , coming finally to rest my open mouth on hers . \\n▁ it was too much for her . \\n▁ she 'd wanted this for too long . \\n▁ she reached down and i jumped as her small hands touched me , slid me closer to the threshold of no return . \\n▁ ` ` not yet . '' \\n▁ i grabbed her hand . \\n▁ ` ` argh ! \\n▁ you 're killing me ! '' \\n▁ i laughed against her mouth , too afraid to move away in case the kiss ended . \\n▁ it was perfect this way , as if my heart was finally filled with the blood it needed to survive . \\n▁ and our lips wanted nothing more than to stay together - comfortable , warm , and familiar . \\n▁ i 'd kissed many girls before , and none of them felt this right . \\n▁ i just wanted to hold on and never let her go . \\n▁ i loved her . \\n▁ and it was as simple as that . \\n▁ no matter what i 'd done or would ever do to hurt her , i loved her . \\n▁ she moved her knees , lifting them up , wrapping her legs around me , and i could no longer bear it . \\n▁ i slipped my hand between her legs and guided myself inside her , thrusting a little harder than i meant to . \\n▁ but she cried only with pleasure , her heart feeling what mine did : free , complete . \\n▁ i could see it in her thoughts . \\n▁ she tangled her fingers in my hair , using all her strength to hold me close . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ i asked , laughing into the curve of her neck . \\n▁ ` ` i just … '' david was never that passionate . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay . '' \\n▁ so she liked it a little rougher . \\n▁ i looked down at her , smiling as i moved my hips against hers with a little more force , hearing our flesh clap each time it met . \\n▁ i needed to be closer , but i could n't pump that way if our chests were touching , so i slowed things down and laid my body atop hers , resting my jaw on her brow , feeling her soft breath warm against my throat . \\n▁ there was a kind of energy between us , surrounding us , that felt solid , like we were grounded by a force outside our awareness . \\n▁ she leaned down and kissed the mark on my arm softly , closing her eyes as she remembered the first time she saw it by the lake that day - how much she loved me even then . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i love you . '' \\n▁ i stopped and drew back to look down at her , dead shocked . \\n▁ i never ever thought she 'd have the strength to admit that to me - not in a million years . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , too , ara . \\n▁ for forever , '' i said , then quickly kissed her mouth . \\n▁ ` ` and i will die loving you . '' \\n▁ she rolled back , closing her eyes for a second as my words entered her heart and soul , killing her a little . \\n▁ i could n't look . \\n▁ i did n't want to see her suffer for my death , then reason that it was better than losing david . \\n▁ then again , maybe i deserved to see it . \\n▁ i looked down to where our bodies connected , watching myself go inside her , the gentle curve of her waist and the soft white flesh on her belly colouring my peripheral . \\n▁ she was so petite ; hips small enough to wrap my hands around , her thighs almost too bony , the joints showing where her legs parted - only a soft , small handful of flesh covering it , quivering each time i brushed against her . \\n▁ i wanted to bite her there - could almost taste the memory in the back of my throat ; could still see remnants of the scar i left on the night i tried to turn her . \\n▁ but she was n't thinking about that . \\n▁ she was ready . \\n▁ her body getting hotter and wetter . \\n▁ i was n't sure if she 'd felt an orgasm before , but i was hell - bent on making sure this was one she 'd never forget . \\n▁ i leaned back a little and licked my thumb before pressing it to the most sensitive spot a guy can ever touch a girl . \\n▁ and she swore , her body almost freezing with shock . \\n▁ clearly , david had never ventured to this realm , either . \\n▁ ` ` what is that ? '' \\n▁ she said , way too loud . \\n▁ i looked over at her door , smiling . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk stimulation . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ such a sweet innocent thing she was . \\n▁ her eyes met mine , and past the obvious pleasure she was feeling , i saw curiosity . \\n▁ she wondered why i was smiling that way , what i found so funny . \\n▁ but it was n't amusement , not at her expense anyway . \\n▁ i was just happy . \\n▁ happy to be here , with her , feeling her this way . \\n▁ i felt her tighten inside . \\n▁ and her mind told me to move left , when i knew i needed to move right . \\n▁ i shifted my thumb , making softer circles , pressing firmer each time she groaned , and when the tightening reached the highest point inside her , i let go , thrusting myself toward it , falling down hard on top of her . \\n▁ moisture flooded between us , making everything deliciously wet , scented with her sweet smell . \\n▁ she could hardly breathe , hardly focus on anything , and her fingernails went deep into my ribs , cutting , her legs firmly around my hips , pulling me into place , holding me exactly where she wanted me . \\n▁ and i let go - felt myself release , emptying every ounce of love , lust , desire , pain , sorrow , regret and longing into her , imagining my life force race through , deeper and deeper to a place where miracles happened and life was conceived . \\n▁ we were one . \\n▁ one soul . \\n▁ one heart . \\n▁ one love . \\n▁ forever . \\n▁ a lifetime of eternity folded out in the seconds before us , and she was mine for all that time . \\n▁ i saw it all - the future , the past , the world that could and never would be . \\n▁ i was not in it . \\n▁ and a part of me wondered , as much as it hoped , that she would not move on from me - she would not be okay without me , because i knew that each day that would pass until my death , i would not be okay without her . \\n▁ a threshold had been crossed , and i never wanted to go back to before . \\n▁ back to wondering what life would be like loving her . \\n▁ i 'd tasted it now , and i would never again be the same . \\n▁ i could feel her fragile body beneath mine , feel her tight and warm around me , feel every move , every twitch inside her , but the only thing my heart focused on was her hand against my chest , placed there so absently ; a touch of love , her thin fingers so precious and delicate , so fiery and dangerous , so sweetly and wonderfully mine . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and focused on our last seconds together before all this would end . \\n▁ if i could have taken her life in that breath and given mine at the same time , and it would ' ve meant we 'd stay like this forever , i would have . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ i slipped my hand beneath her spine and rolled her body up , cradling her face to my chest , feeling her soft , lustful breaths brush my bare skin as tears fell past my lashes and into her hair . \\n▁ ` ` i wish i could hold onto you like this forever . '' \\n▁ she kissed my chest , running a finger over the wet spot her lips left , then wrapped herself around me so tightly i held my own breath . \\n▁ i never wanted her to let go , but i knew it was time . \\n▁ i knew the heat would die down any second now , allowing room for regret , fear , concern … sorrow . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ i shuffled back , slipping out of her . \\n▁ ` ` yeah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this wo n't make it okay . '' \\n▁ my gut sunk . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i mean … i love him . \\n▁ i really do , and i. . . \\n▁ i can see his face . \\n▁ i can see the way he 'll look at me when i tell him the baby 's yours . '' \\n▁ she shut her eyes around that thought . \\n▁ ` ` shh . '' \\n▁ i kissed her eye , running my thumb over her lashes . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . \\n▁ we 'll tell him together . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` we ca n't . \\n▁ he needs to be free to have an emotional reaction . \\n▁ he ca n't do that with you there - with anyone else there . '' \\n▁ i sat back a little more . \\n▁ ` ` it 's his emotional reaction i ' m worried about , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` he wo n't hurt me , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you do n't know him very well . '' \\n▁ ` ` or maybe you do n't . '' \\n▁ i moved back when she shoved me and slid out of bed . \\n▁ ` ` stop always thinking the worst of him . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , i ' ve seen it . \\n▁ i ' ve goddamn well seen him hit a girl before . '' \\n▁ i stood beside her , wishing i could touch her , make her see reason . \\n▁ ` ` why wo n't you listen to me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it 's irrelevant , jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` look what we did . '' \\n▁ she pointed at the bed . \\n▁ ` ` we betrayed him . \\n▁ we loved each other in his bed . \\n▁ he 'd be right to hurt me for that , jason . '' \\n▁ i ran forward and gently grabbed her arm . \\n▁ ` ` no , ara . \\n▁ he would n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` just get off me . '' \\n▁ she shrugged away . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want this anymore . \\n▁ i do n't want the confusion . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not confusing , ara . \\n▁ you love me . \\n▁ you said it yourself . '' \\n▁ i tired to touch her again , but she pushed me away . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i do n't want this ! \\n▁ i do n't want to love you ! '' \\n▁ she screamed . \\n▁ her words moved across space and time , coming to rest in the deepest , most tender part of my heart ; she meant that . \\n▁ i stood taller , scanning her thoughts , feeling the ache go deeper , appearing in salty pools in my eyes when the confirmation only stared back at me again and again . \\n▁ she meant that . \\n▁ she may have loved me , but it was n't what she wanted . \\n▁ she sent the thought to me , standing strong , looking so beautiful and perfectly pale there , completely naked in front of me , that i refused to believe it . \\n▁ ` ` ara , i ca n't read you right now , '' my voice shook . \\n▁ ` ` i need you to tell me you do n't really mean that . '' \\n▁ her lip quivered as she looked into my eyes , and i felt her soul break free of her heart - felt this icy rush of agony tear through her . \\n▁ she sunk to her knees and covered her head . \\n▁ she looked so small and fragile and … hurt . \\n▁ i hurt her . \\n▁ again . \\n▁ and again . \\n▁ and again . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what i feel , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` i just need you to go . \\n▁ i just need to be alone . '' \\n▁ ` ` sure . \\n▁ okay . '' \\n▁ i grabbed my jeans and slipped my legs into them , my heart breaking so deep i grabbed a pillow off the floor instead of my shirt . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll uh - '' i wanted to say i 'll see you later , but i was n't sure i would . \\n▁ i was n't sure she would ever look at me again , nor was i sure i could hang around to see her hate me tomorrow . \\n▁ i opened the door and took one last look at that broken , beautiful girl , and closed it behind me , checking the corridor for onlookers . \\n▁ the halls , the rooms , every corner of the manor was more isolated , more unbearably empty that morning than any day i 'd ever spent alone or in pain . \\n▁ i walked slowly back to my room , holding my breath and her pillow to my chest , my jeans hanging low down my hips , the rest of my clothes tucked under my arm . \\n▁ i 'd just spent the most wonderful night of my life in the arms of the only girl i would ever love , and today , i would mourn that mistake . \\n▁ i stood outside the dream , watching jason through my own eyes again , and when i blinked , saw myself sitting on the floor in my room . \\n▁ my naked body flickered with blue light each time i heaved the sadness from my lungs . \\n▁ but i did n't stay there . \\n▁ i rose , covered my body with a thin nightdress , and tiptoed from the room . \\n▁ ` ` where are you going ? '' \\n▁ i asked myself , but she did n't hear . \\n▁ and i no longer felt like this was just a dream . \\n▁ it was too real . \\n▁ i felt the air , the chill , the tears fall from her eyes and down my own cheeks - felt the wind whip my hair out then , coming off the ocean in a violent swirl . \\n▁ a storm raged above us , making the lighthouse we were suddenly standing on feel rocky and unstable . \\n▁ i bent at the knees , reaching both hands out as if to grab on to something , but she did n't . \\n▁ she stood at the cusp of the roof , her toes hanging over the abyss , her heart - shaped locket in an xxunk hand . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ i yelled over the wind . \\n▁ she did n't answer . \\n▁ she did n't need to . \\n▁ both this girl of the past and the one of the future knew what came next . \\n▁ her hand opened , releasing the locket a second before she threw herself over the edge . \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ i jumped for her , but i missed , and her thick dark hair slipped through my fingers , following her to the rocky depths beneath . \\n▁ ` ` what have you done , ara ? \\n▁ please - please let this just be a bad dream . '' \\n▁ but it was n't a dream . \\n▁ i knew , as i looked over the edge and saw david lift her in his arms , fall to his knees and cradle her mangled body to his chest , that all this had already happened . \\n▁ i slept with jason , loved him as i 'd never loved any man before , and i threw myself off this lighthouse because i did n't want to face that pain . \\n▁ i did n't want to love him . \\n▁ months had gone by since that day , and things had changed so much that everything david and i once were had now become something new - built on something entirely different to what our love had been built on before . \\n▁ i did n't want to lose that . \\n▁ i did n't want to be that girl who died for the pain of loving two men equally . \\n▁ i was n't her anymore . \\n▁ ` ` let her die . '' \\n▁ i stood in the field as david carried her toward the manor . \\n▁ ` ` david , you wo n't love her anymore . \\n▁ please do n't cry for her . '' \\n▁ i wanted to reach out and make him okay . \\n▁ i wanted to touch him and let him see what she 'd become - show him what she 'd done with his brother while he was searching for a way to save their future child . \\n▁ ` ` and now you see , '' she said , standing beside me in the air of the stilled morning - the trees in the field unmoving , the breeze having retreated with the storm almost as quickly as it came . \\n▁ ` ` this is why i jumped . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was n't enough , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't die . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ she clutched the bloodied edges of her nightgown . \\n▁ ` ` but , i ' m not going back to my body . '' \\n▁ ` ` they 'll make you , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` how do you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it already happened . '' \\n▁ we both looked off to the manor then , and everything went pitch black . \\n▁ i opened my eyes to the dawn touching my room - my fingers tangled around the sheets under me , and took a few heavy breaths , trying to compose myself . \\n▁ but i could n't . \\n▁ i 'd slept with jason . \\n▁ that feeling - the empty feeling like i 'd forgotten something - that was it . \\n▁ all this time , my heart was trying to tell me what i 'd done . \\n▁ i sat up and hugged my knees , folding myself into a small ball at the head of my bed . \\n▁ it was all just too late . \\n▁ my love for david had changed , and far outweighed what i felt for jason now . \\n▁ but the damage had been done , and could n't be repaired or clouded by a stolen memory . \\n▁ i was a monster - not fit for this world , not fit to be queen , and certainly not fit to be david 's wife . \\n▁ the sun rose and fell again . \\n▁ my door opened , faces came and went , stared at me , touched me , talked at me , but i ignored them all , even jason , who squatted by my side , brushed his fingertips over my hairline then stiffened all over . \\n▁ he knew . \\n▁ he saw that i 'd had the dream - saw that the block he 'd put in place was n't strong enough to keep my inquisitive mind out if it was searching for something . \\n▁ problem was before was , i just did n't know i needed to be searching for something . \\n▁ but he should have guarded his own dreams with more care , knowing i could sometimes enter them . \\n▁ and then again , maybe he meant for me to find that one . \\n▁ maybe he was just tired of carrying that burden on his own . \\n▁ he sat down beside me and said nothing for the longest time , and i did n't mind his company . \\n▁ in a few days , we 'd be separated for good . \\n▁ it had to be that way . \\n▁ in this short time david and i were allowed to be together , free of restrictions , i 'd grown to love him greater than i ever imagined possible . \\n▁ and if i was going to lose that now , i never wanted to see another man , or feel another happy feeling , as long as i lived . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted to tell him , ara , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` i just did n't want to destroy your last few months together . '' \\n▁ ` ` you would n't have , '' i whispered , and he was so shocked i spoke that he gasped , coming up on his knees . \\n▁ ` ` once he finds out , '' i added , ` ` he wo n't have a reason to die for me anymore . '' \\n▁ i heard him sigh my name out , but when i looked up , the sun was suddenly gone and so was jason . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` ara , please ? '' \\n▁ morg stood in front of me like some sour - faced old hag at a nursing home , jamming a plate in my face . \\n▁ ` ` you have n't eaten for two days . \\n▁ just … '' ` ` go away , '' i said numbly , my face dry and sore from tears . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ i will . \\n▁ but you ca n't keep this up . \\n▁ david 's called three times . \\n▁ he 's - '' ` ` call him . '' \\n▁ my eyes met hers , and the blackness of her pupils expanded . \\n▁ ` ` call him , tell him to come home . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , but … '' she looked down at her phone . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ the tears spilled out over my cheeks then , without having filed a request . \\n▁ ` ` just tell him to come home . '' \\n▁ ` ` tell him yourself . '' \\n▁ she held the phone to my ear . \\n▁ i heard his breath , heard him ask morgaine several times what was wrong with ara , but i could n't speak . \\n▁ i could n't tell him over the phone . \\n▁ i was n't even sure i could actually find the words to say it . \\n▁ he let out a long , soft sigh . \\n▁ ` ` my love ? \\n▁ is that you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` please come home , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` ara , i ca n't . \\n▁ look , if this is about the dagger , i swear i ' m not planning t - '' ` ` just come home ! '' \\n▁ i screamed down the line , hearing david 's short gasp before i threw the phone at morgaine . \\n▁ she caught it , her eyes white with shock , and gently stuffed it in her pocket , taking backward steps until she closed my bedroom door behind her . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * i heard his voice down the hall . \\n▁ i heard falcon brief him on the ` situation ' as they stood outside my door . \\n▁ my heart beat in my throat , knowing what would come next - knowing how my world would come undone like a loose thread , and there would never be any way to wind it back together again . \\n▁ the door opened and david just stood there for a second , taking in this form on the mattress - all cuddled up to the bed - head , her face probably red and swollen . \\n▁ he squatted down by the bed , reaching out for my leg . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ do n't touch me . '' \\n▁ i backed away , making myself smaller . \\n▁ ` ` my love , you 're scaring me . '' \\n▁ he moved closer , stopping when i shrunk away again . \\n▁ ` ` please . \\n▁ what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i … i. . . '' \\n▁ i sobbed . \\n▁ ` ` aw , ara ? '' \\n▁ he said , half laughing , cupping my chin . \\n▁ ` ` sweetheart , just tell me what it is and we 'll fix it . \\n▁ please ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't fix it , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he laughed again . \\n▁ ` ` maybe we ca n't . \\n▁ but i can at least make you feel better . \\n▁ come here - '' he reached for me but i jerked away and looked up - looked him right in the eye , holding back all the tears , the self - pity , the quivering lip . \\n▁ he did n't need to , nor would he want to see it . \\n▁ ` ` david … '' the world stopped . \\n▁ ` ` i slept with jason . '' \\n▁ his smile widened , a breathy laugh escaping through it before his eyes darkened and he slowly looked down at the ground . \\n▁ ` ` you did what ? '' \\n▁ i wanted so badly to say i was sorry . \\n▁ i was sorry . \\n▁ but that was the last thing he 'd want me to say , and i was sure it would result in his hand across my face . \\n▁ ` ` i slept with jason . '' \\n▁ he stood up . \\n▁ ` ` when ? '' \\n▁ my gaze travelled past him to the five figures standing stunned and still in the room behind him . \\n▁ i closed my eyes , hiding from the ache in theirs . \\n▁ i had n't heard any of them - not one of them walk in the room . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ jason stepped forward , but falcon grabbed him by the arms , holding him in place at command of a single pointed finger from david . \\n▁ ` ` just let me explain . '' \\n▁ ` ` do . \\n▁ not , '' david said , angling his face away . \\n▁ ` ` speak . '' \\n▁ ` ` but she - '' ` ` i said , shut up . '' \\n▁ the cool in david 's voice sent shivers through my body . \\n▁ he turned and looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` get her up . \\n▁ get her on her feet . '' \\n▁ blade gently hoisted me to stand by my arm ; my legs tingled where the blood rushed back into them after so many hours sitting in the same position , and my feet went so numb blade pulled me closer to hold me upright . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ he asked , but i did n't answer . \\n▁ my eyes were locked onto david , gauging his every move against my expectations . \\n▁ i should n't have been afraid , because anything he chose to do to me would be fair . \\n▁ but i was scared as hell anyway . \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ david said . \\n▁ mike looked up from his hands where he 'd fallen to sit on the coffee table . \\n▁ ` ` i - '' ` ` did you know ? '' \\n▁ he could n't even speak . \\n▁ he was completely lost for words , and i could n't decipher what i saw in his eyes - the hurt , the anger , the worry - whether it was for what i 'd done , or for what david had the legal right to do next . \\n▁ ` ` how long ago ? '' \\n▁ david looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` the lighthouse . '' \\n▁ he folded forward ever so slightly . \\n▁ ` ` that 's why you were out there ? \\n▁ that 's how you fell ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and … what ? \\n▁ you … you were just gon na … '' ` ` she did n't know . '' \\n▁ jason took a step forward , stopped instantly by falcon . \\n▁ ` ` i erased it . '' \\n▁ david just nodded , his jaw so tight his cheeks hollowed . \\n▁ ` ` that 's real f * * king convenient , is n't it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it had to be that way , '' jason said softly . \\n▁ ` ` she could n't carry the burden . '' \\n▁ ` ` the burden ? '' \\n▁ david said , pointing at me . \\n▁ ` ` the burden is hers to carry . \\n▁ she … oh god ! '' \\n▁ he dropped both hands to his knees , catching his breath . \\n▁ ` ` i can have you both stoned for this . \\n▁ do you know that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` among other things , '' falcon added , looking at me with that stern disapproval he 'd seemed to have traded for friendship over the last few months . \\n▁ it was all destroyed now . \\n▁ everything . \\n▁ all the faith they had in me , just gone , like sudden death . \\n▁ ` ` just … '' david stood tall again . \\n▁ ` ` just get out . \\n▁ everyone . '' \\n▁ no one moved . \\n▁ ` ` i said out ! '' \\n▁ he screamed , grabbing my arm as i went to pass . \\n▁ ` ` not you . '' \\n▁ ` ` david . '' \\n▁ mike 's hand came down on david 's wrist , making a tight grip as he forced it off me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not leaving her - '' ` ` you will do as you are told , or i will have you whipped . '' \\n▁ ` ` go ahead . \\n▁ i ' m not afraid of a lashing . '' \\n▁ he stood halfway between david and i. ` ` you might be the king , but she is still my best friend , and i will not leave her at your mercy . '' \\n▁ ` ` then i officially relieve you of your duties . '' \\n▁ he walked over and opened my door , leaning out to look down the corridor . \\n▁ ` ` guards ! '' \\n▁ mike took a step back , his eyes holding the deepest , most feared apology . \\n▁ ` ` arrest him for violation of matrimonial rights . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , please ? \\n▁ do n't take this out on - '' ` ` silence . '' \\n▁ he pointed right in my face . \\n▁ ` ` or this gets worse for all of you . '' \\n▁ i backed down , shaking my head at mike . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , ara , '' he said , laying both hands behind his back as the guard cuffed him . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll be okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` not for her , it wo n't , '' david said coldly , and before mike could react , his eyes going wide , his foot lifting only an inch to move toward me , the guard cupped his chin and the back of his head , twisting until his neck snapped and he went down hard . \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ david 's arm shot out and blocked me off . \\n▁ ` ` stay away . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 'll be okay , ara , '' blade said , dragging me backward . \\n▁ ` ` he 'll recover from that . '' \\n▁ ` ` that was n't fair . '' \\n▁ i hid my face in my hands . \\n▁ ` ` he was just trying to protect me . '' \\n▁ ` ` and the same fate awaits anyone else with any stupid ideas , '' david said , turning to me . \\n▁ ` ` you are entitled to the protection the law allows , ara . \\n▁ nothing more . \\n▁ and it does not protect you from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what about jason ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ david 's eyes darkened , his lips parting to say something , when falcon cut in , his knuckles going white where they fought to restrain jason . \\n▁ ` ` orders , majesty . '' \\n▁ ` ` throw him in a cell . '' \\n▁ david waved his hand at them . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll deal with him later . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , your majesty . '' \\n▁ falcon bowed . \\n▁ ` ` david , please , '' jason begged . \\n▁ ` ` please . \\n▁ do what you want to me , but do n't touch her . \\n▁ she 's ca - '' ` ` blade , '' david ordered . \\n▁ ` ` see that falcon gets him to the cell without incident . '' \\n▁ ` ` as you will it . '' \\n▁ blade bowed his head , obeying , but his soul and heart would never be at david 's command . \\n▁ he looked jason in the eye , muttering an apology , and twisted his arm up behind his back . \\n▁ ` ` let me go ! '' \\n▁ jason yelled . \\n▁ ` ` blade , you know what he 'll do . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't protect her , mate , '' blade said , his voice strained with the fight . \\n▁ ` ` none of us can . '' \\n▁ but jason would n't give this up , not even for his friend . \\n▁ limbs tangled and blurred between them , like cars moving fast down a freeway , the rest of us watching on , just waiting for the uneven odds to work in someone 's favour . \\n▁ ` ` ara , just run , '' jason screamed . \\n▁ ` ` just - '' ` ` oh , for god 's sake , '' morgaine groaned , tossing the dagger from her belt to blade . \\n▁ ` ` just shut him up . '' \\n▁ ` ` got it . '' \\n▁ he caught it with one hand , forcing his arm down over falcon 's as they slammed jason face first into the doorframe , pining him there . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , mate . \\n▁ this is gon na hurt me a lot more than it 'll hurt you . '' \\n▁ jason cried out , the dagger slipping between the bones in his neck , paralysing him to submission in one strike . \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ i screamed , but the door slammed shut on the empty room . \\n▁ ` ` do n't cry for him , '' david ordered , shoving my hand down from my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you dare shed one tear for him , ara . \\n▁ he will get more than a dagger to the spine when i ' m done with him . '' \\n▁ i let my hands fall to my sides , my fists tight . \\n▁ ` ` if you touch one hair on his head , i - '' ` ` you 'll what ? '' \\n▁ he moved in , startling me with the speed of which he came up . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll what , ara ? \\n▁ leave ? \\n▁ good . \\n▁ fuck him to hurt me ? \\n▁ already done that , so what else can you do ? \\n▁ what else can you possibly do that 's going to make me give two ounces of shit ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' my mouth hung open , nothing coming out . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know how to deal with this , ara , '' he said , his voice softer than before . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what to do with you - what to say , what to feel . \\n▁ i - '' he touched his chest , swallowing like his throat had narrowed , and sat down on his side of the bed - his head in hands . \\n▁ ` ` david ? \\n▁ i do n't know , either . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` do n't talk . \\n▁ if you know what 's good for you , do not let one word come out of that f * * king slut mouth of yours . '' \\n▁ i was so taken back by those words that i forgot everything i planned to say . \\n▁ the silence lingered in the room for so long then . \\n▁ i tried not to breathe , not to do anything that would alter the pattern of his thoughts . \\n▁ my life , and jason 's life , rested on his decisions right now , and he was so clearly hurt i was sure he was capable of anything , even carrying out my punishment himself . \\n▁ ` ` it 's over , '' he said suddenly in the quietest breath , as if the very notion had just struck him , bringing down all the realisation of the lonely centuries to come on top of it . \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' i whispered , but it was so low he would n't really have heard it . \\n▁ ` ` you made a promise , ara . \\n▁ that 's it . \\n▁ i trusted you , believed you . \\n▁ i. . . '' \\n▁ he stood up and faced me , touching his chest . \\n▁ ` ` i gave you the one part of myself i never ever gave to anyone else because i believed you would hold it sacred , protect it , cherish it like i did yours . \\n▁ i would never have hurt you that way , ara . \\n▁ never in a million years . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i sobbed , sucking the streaming tears from lip . \\n▁ ` ` and i loved you too , i - '' ` ` but my eternal love just was n't enough for you , was it ? \\n▁ and who 's the fool ? '' \\n▁ his voice broke . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not you , is it ? \\n▁ no . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` it 's me . \\n▁ i ' m the fool . \\n▁ i ' m the one stupid enough to believe this was real - that anything outside death , murder , hatred , loneliness was real . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was real . '' \\n▁ i stepped a little closer . \\n▁ ` ` no , it was stupid . \\n▁ all of it . '' \\n▁ he laughed , closing his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` and i knew it from the start . \\n▁ what did i say to you that day , ara - what did i say the day i left you in the hospital ? '' \\n▁ ` ` all dreams eventually die , '' i muttered , seeing his face - the way he loved me back then - so different to how he looked at me now . \\n▁ because , now , he really believed those words . \\n▁ ` ` i should have listened to my own wisdom then . \\n▁ i should never have given everything up for you . \\n▁ i left my set , i - '' ` ` you did n't give up the set for me . \\n▁ you gave it up because justice failed you , and - '' ` ` is that what you think ? '' \\n▁ he asked , incredulous . \\n▁ ` ` is that what you honestly think ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` then you 're even stupider than i thought , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` or maybe there 's just always been this miscommunication between us . '' \\n▁ i reached for him . \\n▁ ` ` do n't touch me . '' \\n▁ he jerked away . \\n▁ ` ` do you think i want you to touch me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ just … '' ` ` just what ? \\n▁ what should i do , ara ? \\n▁ you tell me , because i - '' his eyes drifted off to one side , coated thickly with tears . \\n▁ ` ` i just do n't know anymore . \\n▁ i … for the first time in my life , i just … i got no answers . '' \\n▁ ` ` you just need to think , to - '' ` ` think about what ? '' \\n▁ he offered both palms . \\n▁ ` ` you won . \\n▁ what d'you want from me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i want you to stay . \\n▁ i want you to think about things before you leave . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ his shoulders lifted once - his heart completely breaking under the stern gaze he tried to hold . \\n▁ ` ` it 's all gone . \\n▁ i was wrong . \\n▁ i … i had this idea in my head . \\n▁ god ! '' \\n▁ he tapped his temple a few times , folding over . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't i just listen ? \\n▁ i should have known love like that was too good to be true . \\n▁ and i believed it , ara . \\n▁ i did . \\n▁ i believed it to my core - to the point where i was blinded enough to actually think the feelings you had for my brother were xxunk - that it was just confusion or maybe that he felt more for you than you did for him . \\n▁ i never - '' he paused and looked out the window , sniffing once . \\n▁ ` ` i never , for one second , believed you actually loved him , that you could actually … '' his voice broke and his hand came up to cover his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` you could n't have known , david . \\n▁ and you should n't have even had to imagine it was possible . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i should ' ve seen it . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't blame yourself . \\n▁ it - '' ` ` i do n't . \\n▁ i blame you . \\n▁ and i blame him . \\n▁ and you are goddamn well lucky you told me , ara , because i 'd found out for myself , i 'd have beaten you to death with my own hands . '' \\n▁ my heart skipped a beat , restarting again a little faster . \\n▁ ` ` you 're hurt , david . \\n▁ i get that . \\n▁ but i do n't believe you 're capable of murder . '' \\n▁ very slowly , and with what looked like hesitation wrought with an awful lot of anger , he moved his gaze onto me , rolling his shoulders back so he stood as tall and strong as a king - his uniform broadening his shoulders , the sword in his belt glistening in the afternoon sun , as if whispering its evil will . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m the king , '' he said , seeming to find the meaning in those words only as he spoke them . \\n▁ ` ` you are guilty of treason , and i have a duty to uphold . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , please . \\n▁ it - '' ` ` do n't ! \\n▁ say . \\n▁ a word , ara . '' \\n▁ he turned to the window , his lips fighting their own battle with his thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not going to charge you with this crime because , right now , the monarchy is unstable , and your people need an honest , strong queen . '' \\n▁ my throat opened with the sudden breath of shock . \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` even if it is a lie , '' he said , his lip turned in disgust . \\n▁ he held my gaze for a second , then made a very stiff , very slow about - face and walked away , closing the door gently behind him . \\n▁ chapter eleven i opened my door and falcon stepped into sight , his head hung low . \\n▁ ` ` go away , falcon . '' \\n▁ i pushed past him . \\n▁ ` ` i have nothing to say to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was n't what you think , ara . '' \\n▁ i stopped dead and spun around to face him , my words coming out through my teeth . \\n▁ ` ` do not address me in such an informal manner . \\n▁ you are a soldier in the queen 's guard , and - '' ` ` and i acted as such . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ you sided with the king . \\n▁ you did his bidding . \\n▁ you - '' ` ` i did what i had to to protect you , ara , '' he yelled , then stood taller , sobering himself . \\n▁ ` ` under the laws of the lilithian monarchy , you and all your guard are bound by the sacred right of matrimony . \\n▁ we can not go against your betrothed . \\n▁ how he sees fit to punish you is out of our control . \\n▁ he could place you over his knee and spank you right in front of us , and we ca n't do a goddamn thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ but … '' my eyes flicked over every inch of falcon 's face . \\n▁ ` ` that 's ridiculous . '' \\n▁ ` ` which is exactly why blade and i have spent the better part of this morning xxunk those laws . \\n▁ there was never need for a xxunk that gives a guard the power to protect his queen from her own husband . \\n▁ it just has n't been done in this monarchy before , and we never imagined it would . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i know we let you down , but even if that had n't been the case , i still would ' ve arrested jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because he 'd have gotten you both killed . \\n▁ if he 'd stepped in and tried to defend you , the king absolutely would have lost his temper . \\n▁ why do you think blade was so quick to knock jason out , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ he touched my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` the best thing for you , for all of us , was to get jason out of sight . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you left me alone with him - not knowing what he 'd do to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i never - '' he slashed his pointed finger through the air , '' - not for one instant , left you alone with him . \\n▁ as soon as blade had everything under control , i was outside , on your balcony , making sure he did nothing to hurt you . '' \\n▁ i softened , dropping back on my heels . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ his lips pursed to hold his jaw tight , and i saw the faintest shimmer in his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` what kind of man do you think i am ? '' \\n▁ i folded my arms . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i just do n't really know who i can trust anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` you can trust me . '' \\n▁ he stepped closer . \\n▁ ` ` if the king had so much as even thought about raising a hand to you , i 'd have smashed that glass door and been under his fist before it struck your face , ara , even though , to do so , would mean i faced the death sentence . '' \\n▁ ` ` the death sentence ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's the punishment for acting against the king 's sacred rights . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 'd go to that length for me ? '' \\n▁ i said , half laughing as though it was preposterous . \\n▁ he grabbed my arm again . \\n▁ ` ` i am sworn by my own blood to protect you . \\n▁ but even if i undid that oath , ara , i would still die for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` believe it or not , i care about you . \\n▁ you - '' he cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` in truth , you remind me of someone i lost many years ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ ` ` annie , '' he said , moistening his lips . \\n▁ ` ` my little sister . '' \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know you ever had a sister . '' \\n▁ he smiled fondly . \\n▁ ` ` she was just as naive and pigheaded as you , but i loved her , ara . \\n▁ and i … i do n't want to admit it , but i goddamn well love you too - as if you were my own sister . '' \\n▁ i just about melted into a puddle of reverence on the floor , but i reached out and hugged falcon instead . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , fal . \\n▁ how did she die ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she was hit by car . \\n▁ she was only seventeen . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ he squeezed me back . \\n▁ ` ` just … just do n't ever think that i do n't have your back , ara . \\n▁ i am always on your side . '' \\n▁ i nodded against his chest and backed away . \\n▁ ` ` okay , then you need to come with me right now . '' \\n▁ ` ` where ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to rescue jason . '' \\n▁ he winked down at me . \\n▁ ` ` already on it . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ he nodded to the end of the corridor . \\n▁ ` ` blade 's got a release order drawn up for you . \\n▁ he 's waiting in the great hall . '' \\n▁ ` ` a release order ? '' \\n▁ we started walking . \\n▁ ` ` why do we need that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's been imprisoned , ara . \\n▁ not just locked away . '' \\n▁ ` ` on what grounds ? '' \\n▁ falcon smirked . \\n▁ ` ` exactly . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , the king has no right to hold him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not unless he either xxunk a crime , or tells the truth about the affair . '' \\n▁ i swallowed hard , looking to the path ahead . \\n▁ that was the first time i 'd heard our act of sin referred to as an affair . \\n▁ and it made me feel dirty , but also lucky david saw the need for a queen in our monarchy , or this evening could ' ve been spent in a very different environment . \\n▁ ` ` what about mike ? \\n▁ where 's he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in bed , sleeping it off . '' \\n▁ i relaxed a bit then . \\n▁ ` ` did the guard hurt him ? '' \\n▁ falcon shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` what about jase … did they … ? '' \\n▁ ` ` jason 's been banged up pretty bad , ara . '' \\n▁ i stopped walking and covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` by … david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not sure . \\n▁ but he left about half an hour ago . \\n▁ no one 's seen him since . '' \\n▁ i started walking again . \\n▁ ` ` will david come back ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' arthur said suddenly , closing his door as he stepped out of his room . \\n▁ my footsteps halted just in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` amara - '' ` ` please do n't , arthur . '' \\n▁ i put my hand up between us . \\n▁ ` ` i know i ' m a disappointment , and i know - '' ` ` that was n't what i was going to say . '' \\n▁ he leaned down a little , placing his hand on my back . \\n▁ ` ` i already knew about the affair . '' \\n▁ ` ` how ? \\n▁ when ? '' \\n▁ ` ` shortly after you fell from the lighthouse . '' \\n▁ ` ` you mean jumped . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he looked up at falcon for a second . \\n▁ ` ` my dear girl , for what happened that night with jason , i do not blame you . \\n▁ and i do not blame him . \\n▁ you were in love . \\n▁ and , yes , you committed an act of sin . \\n▁ but for all the morals and conventions in the world , amara , i can not find it within my heart to place blame on either one of you . '' \\n▁ ` ` and yet , we 're both guilty . '' \\n▁ ` ` or , perhaps , it was meant to be . '' \\n▁ ` ` meant to be ? '' \\n▁ he lowered his gaze to the floor . \\n▁ ` ` your heart always has been torn between the two boys . \\n▁ and - '' ` ` but it 's not anymore , arthur . '' \\n▁ i tapped my chest . \\n▁ ` ` my love for david has changed so much . \\n▁ i do n't want to love jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you do love him , do n't you ? '' \\n▁ i took a small step back . \\n▁ ` ` i said i do n't want to . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you do anyway . '' \\n▁ ` ` not as much as i love his brother . '' \\n▁ i swept past him and started down the stairs quickly . \\n▁ blade was in the doorway to the great hall before i even reached the base , wearing a huge smile , holding up a stack of papers . \\n▁ ` ` ready then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just take me to him . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ morgaine said , coming up behind blade . \\n▁ ` ` morgaine , '' i warned . \\n▁ ` ` i have nothing to say to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` look , i had to do what i had to do . \\n▁ you should never have slept with jason if you wanted to protect him , '' she said , grabbing my arm as i dashed past . \\n▁ and the sudden contact of her hand on my skin made the anger inside me , made the vision of her tossing that dagger to blade , boil up in my body like compounded steam . \\n▁ i swung around to knock her hand away , deciding at the very last second to hook my right fist across her jaw instead . \\n▁ she hit the ground like a sack of apples , dead shock widening the eyes of our onlookers . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' morg said , clambering to her feet . \\n▁ ` ` maybe i deserved that . '' \\n▁ ` ` that , and a lot more . '' \\n▁ i pointed in her face . \\n▁ ` ` let me make this clear to you , morgaine . \\n▁ i do n't trust you . \\n▁ i do n't know what it is that you 're up to , but i do n't trust you . '' \\n▁ ` ` but … what have i ever done ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing yet . '' \\n▁ i stepped backward . \\n▁ ` ` but you 're a traitor . \\n▁ i know you are , and i am damn well going to prove it . '' \\n▁ ` ` what on earth makes you think i ' m a traitor ? '' \\n▁ she called after me . \\n▁ ` ` call it instinct , '' i said , storming off , leaving them all behind . \\n▁ it was n't until i reached the throne room that blade , falcon and arthur caught up . \\n▁ morgaine , however , was nowhere to be seen . \\n▁ the entourage charged forward , with the queen at the helm , our shadows menacing the walls , and as we reached the end of the cellblock , even the guard on duty felt the threat . \\n▁ he stood to attention , his hand on his belt . \\n▁ ` ` your majesty . '' \\n▁ ` ` unlock this door . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , my queen , i have orders from the - '' ` ` under article three , section five , '' blade started , stepping in . \\n▁ and arthur grabbed the keys off the guard 's belt and unlatched the door , shoving it open . \\n▁ our eyes darted across the dark space , moving from one corner to the other , but jason was n't there . \\n▁ ` ` arthur ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's in there , '' he said , offering me the path . \\n▁ ` ` i can smell his blood . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth , noticing it then , too . \\n▁ ` ` what have they done to him ? '' \\n▁ he lowered his cheek to mine and aimed his finger to the centre of the room for me to follow . \\n▁ and there , at the end of my gaze , was a beaten , bloodied man - his arms chained , back flat to the wall , head hung loosely between his shoulders . \\n▁ his cuts had healed , wherever they had been , aside from the deep gashes cuffing his wrists where they 'd clearly been tugging at the chains for too long , but he was n't conscious , and the blood of his agony still smothered his skin . \\n▁ i was by his side before my eyes even closed into their next blink , and had the chains torn off , his head in my lap before arthur noticed i was gone . \\n▁ ` ` what have they done to him ? '' \\n▁ i screeched . \\n▁ ` ` only what was asked , your majesty , '' the guard said , looking up from the release order . \\n▁ ` ` barbarians , '' arthur said , stepping into the cage . \\n▁ ` ` all of you . '' \\n▁ the man ignored him . \\n▁ he was clearly a vampire and really did n't have all that much compassion . \\n▁ ` ` is he gon na be okay ? '' \\n▁ i looked up to where arthur squatted in front of us . \\n▁ he examined jason and nodded , giving me a reassuring smile . \\n▁ ` ` he 's already done most of the healing himself . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank god . '' \\n▁ i sat back against the wall and tangled my fingers in jase 's hair , holding him close to my heart , as if maybe the beat would rouse him from sleep . \\n▁ the wall was still warm where his body had been against it for so long , and sticky with blood . \\n▁ i just did n't care how gross it felt under my shoulder , though . \\n▁ he did n't deserve this . \\n▁ i got yelled at - lost my marriage , but my fate was in no way equal to his . \\n▁ and i knew this was just the beginning . \\n▁ david would n't let jason live now , and he certainly would n't let him stay at the manor and support our cause any longer . \\n▁ this embrace , this moment holding him while he was unconscious was , i knew , one of my last . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ he mumbled , trying to lift his hand . \\n▁ ` ` shh . '' \\n▁ i leaned down and kissed his bloody hair . \\n▁ ` ` it 's me . \\n▁ you 're safe now . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , are you okay ? '' \\n▁ he looked up suddenly with panicked eyes . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i ' m fine , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` did he hurt you ? \\n▁ i ' ve been so xxunk - '' he coughed , cupping his ribs after - the sound ending in a short whimper . \\n▁ ` ` your ribs . \\n▁ what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think my lung might be punctured . '' \\n▁ ` ` here . '' \\n▁ i slid my wrist past my teeth , ignoring the sting as the skin tore open , and pressed it jason 's mouth . \\n▁ he looked at it for a second , then at my eyes . \\n▁ i smiled down at him . \\n▁ ` ` just drink . \\n▁ if david wants to kill me for sharing blood with you , so be it . \\n▁ he should n't have had you beaten . '' \\n▁ ` ` he did n't , '' jase said , and started drinking . \\n▁ i stroked his hair back lovingly , revelling in the warm rush of blood leaving my veins . \\n▁ ` ` who did then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it does n't matter . '' \\n▁ he sat up a bit , shifting rigidly to the wall beside me , not even bothering to wipe my blood clean from his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` i deserved it , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ because you and i slept together ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` jase … you did it to save david . '' \\n▁ he wrapped his arm around me and held me close . \\n▁ ` ` and that still does n't make it okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , it does n't . \\n▁ it was stupid and impulsive , but … '' ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ i wanted to slide my fingers into his hand and hold it . \\n▁ i wanted to tell him i was n't sorry , wanted to say that i loved him , that i jumped off that lighthouse because i could n't live in a world where my heart was torn . \\n▁ i wanted to tell him that i could be his now that david did n't want me . \\n▁ but i would n't have meant any of it . \\n▁ truth was , i did love jason - loved him more back then than i did now . \\n▁ and all i wanted in the world was to go back to that night and stop myself from doing what we did , even if it meant david would have to die . \\n▁ because i could live with that a lot easier than i could live with his pain . \\n▁ i rested my head on jase 's shoulder and just sat with him , the guard , arthur , and blade all watching on , until the air cleared and jason started breathing properly again . \\n▁ ` ` knock - knock , '' i said , tapping on mike 's bedroom door . \\n▁ he looked up from the cardboard box on his bed , laying a shirt in it as he turned around . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` are … '' i walked in with my arms folded , eyeing the ten or so staff that were packing things down and closing up boxes , the evening sun setting quickly in the sky behind them . \\n▁ ` ` are you leaving me , mike ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he turned away again and added the rest of the shirt pile to his box . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m being evicted - moving down the barracks . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` these rooms are for the highest ranking members in the monarchy , ara . \\n▁ david ranks higher than me . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's moving in here ? '' \\n▁ i stepped forward in one sweeping move , my jaw leading the way . \\n▁ ` ` guess so . '' \\n▁ mike rubbed his neck . \\n▁ ` ` oh , by the way , we ' ve called an emergency council meeting - just the private council , to discuss our next move . \\n▁ we 're meeting in the round room in twenty . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , okay . '' \\n▁ i looked at the clock on mike 's wall . \\n▁ ` ` but it 's almost dinner time . '' \\n▁ ` ` things need discussing . '' \\n▁ ` ` what things ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you think , ara ? \\n▁ how ` bout that little confession you made this morning ? '' \\n▁ ` ` did n't realize there was anything to discuss . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course there is . '' \\n▁ he sighed , shaking his head . \\n▁ ` ` look , just let me get this finished , would ya ? '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , but … '' i stood back and let him pass with his box . \\n▁ ` ` well , how 's your neck ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's fine . '' \\n▁ he dusted his hands off and slid his thumbs into his pockets , dropping his head while he let out a huge sigh . \\n▁ ` ` why 'd you do it ? \\n▁ why 'd you sleep with jason ? '' \\n▁ i closed my mouth and drew a really long breath through my nose . \\n▁ ` ` honestly , mike , because i loved him . '' \\n▁ ` ` loved . \\n▁ as in … past tense ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sort of . '' \\n▁ i bit my lip for a second . \\n▁ ` ` so , what , your feelings changed ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not so much changed for how i feel about jason , but … for how i love david . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , what ? \\n▁ you did n't love david before you slept with jason ? '' \\n▁ i smiled . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i did . \\n▁ i just … see , when david and first i met , i came to realise one day , well , to believe , that i could n't live without him . \\n▁ then he told me he had to leave and i could never see him again . '' \\n▁ ` ` because he was a vampire and did n't want you to hate him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i stepped back so a maid could carry a box out the door . \\n▁ ` ` i was so crushed . \\n▁ as you can imagine . '' \\n▁ mike nodded . \\n▁ ` ` then , he told me i could be with him forever , but i had to be a killer , you know , leave all my family and friends behind . \\n▁ which , you know how i felt about that , right ? '' \\n▁ mike scoffed , turning away to fold another box as i spoke . \\n▁ ` ` but , after i nearly died - you know , with the whole masquerade thing , i decided i wanted to go with him - be a vampire . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you did n't have the gene . '' \\n▁ he nodded to himself . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ so , he left me for my own good . \\n▁ and it hurt . '' \\n▁ my voice broke . \\n▁ ` ` and then he came back , but even then we still were n't free to love each other because , at any minute , the set could ' ve come for him and taken him away . \\n▁ we 'd had nothing but stress and worry , and it was n't until he came back from ` the dead ' and lived here at the manor that we ever had a chance to just be together , as every couple should . '' \\n▁ i smiled , thinking about the better times . \\n▁ ` ` things changed for me , mike . \\n▁ there were some humps in the road as we figured out how to love each other , but we did figure it out . \\n▁ and i was happy . \\n▁ i did n't , for the first time since i met him , want anyone else in the world . '' \\n▁ ` ` but this realisation happened after you 'd already slept with jason ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` well , it does n't really matter what you feel for him now , baby , does it ? '' \\n▁ he said absently , sealing another box with clear tape . \\n▁ ` ` you destroyed that door when you slept with jason . \\n▁ he wo n't ever take you back . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do know that . \\n▁ but , it … '' ` ` hurts to admit ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` do you hate me ? '' \\n▁ he breathed out , looking down at both of his big hands , then back up with a sympathetic half - smile . \\n▁ ` ` what happened on the lighthouse , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' i stared out the window , reliving a flashback , blinking against the light when my mind returned to this day . \\n▁ ` ` did you fall ? '' \\n▁ he asked accusingly . \\n▁ ` ` or did you … '' ` ` i jumped . '' \\n▁ he nodded , wetting his lips . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i was mad at myself . \\n▁ i … i did n't think i deserved to live after what i 'd done . \\n▁ and i did n't like the truth i realised when i was with jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` what truth ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that i was in love with him . '' \\n▁ he nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` so you tried to kill yourself to escape it all ? \\n▁ to just , what - '' ` ` mike , please . '' \\n▁ i took an absent step back from him , just needing some air . \\n▁ ` ` everyone hates me now , okay . \\n▁ everyone is mad enough as it is . \\n▁ please do n't be one of them . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you expect me to say ? '' \\n▁ he walked calmly over to stand in front of me . \\n▁ ` ` i love ya , baby , but you messed up something cruel , and then you went and tried to take the coward 's way out . '' \\n▁ i blinked rapidly , sending the tears back where they belonged , trying so hard to breathe in a gentle rhythm , but the pain of regret made my chest cave . \\n▁ i folded over , holding my breath . \\n▁ ` ` look , do n't get me wrong , ar . '' \\n▁ he placed one hand to my back and the other around my arm , and gently made me stand straight again . \\n▁ ` ` i feel for you . \\n▁ i do . \\n▁ and i hate to see you like this , but - '' ` ` i did this to myself . \\n▁ i know . '' \\n▁ he patted my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` this too shall pass . '' \\n▁ i nodded up at him , forcing an odd kind of smile . \\n▁ the corner of his lip pressed into his cheek and he patted my shoulder again , leaving me to find my own way out . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` he ca n't move out , '' blade said , and i stopped walking , pinning my back to the wall in the shadows of the rounded stairwell . \\n▁ ` ` we have to keep up appearances or the upper house will start asking questions . '' \\n▁ ` ` maybe they should , '' morgaine said . \\n▁ ` ` maybe the people should know what their queen did . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you insane ? '' \\n▁ mike jumped in . \\n▁ ` ` they 'll butcher her , morg . \\n▁ you know what the punishment for infidelity is . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but - '' ` ` i do n't , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` mike , what is it - what will they do to her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she could be whipped , at the very least , '' falcon informed . \\n▁ ` ` but the old favourite for ancient lilithian times , still in practice today , '' quaid said , ` ` is la xxunk de la xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that mean ? '' \\n▁ em said . \\n▁ ` ` the burn of chastity . \\n▁ it 's where the victim - '' ` ` accused , '' morg corrected spitefully . \\n▁ ` ` the accused , '' falcon said , pausing after . \\n▁ i heard him swallow hard , even from all the way back here . \\n▁ he cleared his throat and started again . \\n▁ ` ` the accused is held down on a bed , with her legs strapped into stirrups . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , then they heat this small iron club , '' blade said , his jagged tone suggesting hand demonstrations to go with the explanation . \\n▁ ` ` and they insert it into the vagina to melt it shut . '' \\n▁ ` ` the accused would often die of infection , '' falcon added . \\n▁ emily gasped . \\n▁ ` ` david would n't let them . \\n▁ there 's no way he 'd - '' ` ` he would n't have a choice , '' quaid said . \\n▁ ` ` even the king and queen are bound by certain rules . \\n▁ if the house find out , em , they decide her fate , not david . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , surely he has some say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` some , yes , '' falcon said . \\n▁ ` ` but the fact remains . \\n▁ this needs to be swept under the rug like every other act of infidelity in the political history of mankind . \\n▁ there can be no leaked secrets or exposes . '' \\n▁ he paused for a moment . \\n▁ ` ` we 're not talking about a media frenzy , here . \\n▁ we 're talking about brutal mutilation . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 'd heal in six weeks , '' morgaine said . \\n▁ ` ` morg ? '' \\n▁ mike cut in . \\n▁ ` ` whose side are you on ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to be honest , i ' m neutral . \\n▁ she did wrong , mike . \\n▁ maybe , just maybe , this time the punishment fits the crime . '' \\n▁ i heard a chair scrape out . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be damned if i ' m gon na - '' ` ` sit down , '' falcon said in a slightly louder voice . \\n▁ ` ` both of you . \\n▁ this is counterproductive . '' \\n▁ everyone in the room sighed as if the day had just been too long and they were all wrought with too many problems . \\n▁ and they were . \\n▁ and i caused it . \\n▁ i slid down the wall and sat on the cold stone step , listening while they all decided my fate . \\n▁ ` ` she needs to own up to the truth , falcon , '' morgaine said . \\n▁ ` ` she ca n't hide from this . '' \\n▁ ` ` i get that , morg , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` i understand that it will eventually come out . \\n▁ all things do , but - '' ` ` then , as her council , we should advise her to stand tall before her people and admit her mistakes . \\n▁ they might be lenient , '' she reasoned . \\n▁ ` ` and what if they 're not ? '' \\n▁ blade said . \\n▁ ` ` she needs to lay low until david calms down . \\n▁ maybe he 'll just forgive her and all this will be over . '' \\n▁ a few people laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i know her better than anyone , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` why do n't we get her out of here for a few weeks ? \\n▁ she can pretend to take leave , give david time to calm down , and - '' ` ` she needs to face this head - on , '' morg said . \\n▁ ` ` david wo n't calm down , emily . \\n▁ that 's beyond ludicrous . \\n▁ i ' ve known him for over a hundred years . \\n▁ and the fact that he has n't beat her already is a sheer miracle , you - '' ` ` i know him , too , '' emily yelled . \\n▁ ` ` and he loves her , morg . \\n▁ if he found out the house performed that sadistic ritual on her , he 'd rip every last one of them - '' ` ` see ? '' \\n▁ morg laughed condescendingly . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't know him at all , emily . \\n▁ he hates ara . \\n▁ if she wants to avoid such a ` ` sadistic '' ritual , then she needs to - '' ` ` what she needs is to know she 's still got friends , '' falcon said , slamming something down on the table . \\n▁ everyone shut up . \\n▁ ` ` because she 's got ta be feeling like just about the loneliest person in the world right now , and she needs to believe that , at least in our eyes , her mistake does not define her . '' \\n▁ ` ` but it does define her , '' morgaine continued in the same tone , as if falcon had said nothing . \\n▁ ` ` she cheated on david . \\n▁ cheated , falcon . \\n▁ we ca n't excuse that because we love her . '' \\n▁ no one said anything for a few seconds , until , in a very small voice , mike piped up with , ` ` i can . '' \\n▁ blade laughed breathily . \\n▁ ` ` as can i. '' ` ` and i , '' said ryder . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , same here , '' quaid said . \\n▁ ` ` i got her back . \\n▁ she 's young , impulsive and makes some downright dumb mistakes . \\n▁ but she 's a good girl , morg . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's just it , '' falcon added . \\n▁ ` ` she is just a girl . \\n▁ almost every person in this room , aside from emily , is at least five years older than her . \\n▁ she 's been through hell and back again . \\n▁ she 's had nothing but tragedy since she turned seventeen , and she 's not had a goddamn second to process any of it . \\n▁ she slept with jason , '' he added , exhaling loudly after . \\n▁ ` ` but i 'd bet my life she 'd take it back if she could . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , that 's the shitty thing about mistakes , is n't it , falcon ? '' \\n▁ morg said flatly . \\n▁ ` ` there 's no going back . '' \\n▁ ` ` so we just let them xxunk her ? '' \\n▁ blade said , his voice breaking . \\n▁ no one had anything to say . \\n▁ morgaine was right , though ; i did this . \\n▁ not them . \\n▁ i did deserve to be punished . \\n▁ there was no argument to be had . \\n▁ and my council should not have been bearing the weight of my mistake . \\n▁ i stood up , dusted my butt off and composed myself into a picture of sovereignty , then walked slowly into the room . \\n▁ they all looked up , their faces changing when they realised i would ' ve heard them . \\n▁ ` ` david wants to move out of our room , '' i said calmly . \\n▁ ` ` i understand that , and i ' m okay with it . '' \\n▁ ` ` but the house , they - '' ` ` they 'll find out , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` yes , and i will have to stand trial for my crimes . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , they 'll - '' ` ` i know what they 'll do . '' \\n▁ i walked stiffly over and sat down on my chair . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be okay , em . \\n▁ i ' m strong , and i ' ve suffered worse . '' \\n▁ i smiled over at mike . \\n▁ ` ` but i ca n't hide from this . \\n▁ it will come out eventually , and - '' ` ` but it does n't have to be now . '' \\n▁ emily placed her hand over mine . \\n▁ i looked down to where she now squatted on the floor beside me , her caramel eyes reaching to the deepest part of my heart where i knew she hoped to find common sense . \\n▁ but this could n't be reasoned with . \\n▁ ` ` always do the right thing , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` and let the pieces fall where they may . '' \\n▁ ` ` pieces ? '' \\n▁ she cried . \\n▁ ` ` ara , you heard what they said , what they 'll do to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` and i deserve it , emily . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she stood up . \\n▁ ` ` you made a mistake . \\n▁ you do n't deserve to be xxunk like that . '' \\n▁ i looked around the room at each of the faces . \\n▁ ` ` david knows what they 'll do to me if they find out . \\n▁ and he knows that his moving to another room will raise questions . \\n▁ this is inevitable , guys . '' \\n▁ i shrugged , holding my hands out . \\n▁ ` ` you can only run from your problems for so long . \\n▁ they always catch up with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` and they will certainly follow you wherever you go , '' david said , and we all turned around to look at him ; he leaned on the wall in the doorway , one hand in his pocket , his dark gaze cooling the room . \\n▁ ` ` the house will know what you did . \\n▁ but not yet . '' \\n▁ ` ` when ? '' \\n▁ mike asked . \\n▁ ` ` what are you planning , david ? '' \\n▁ the king curled his fingertips inward , inspecting his nails . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not an entirely cruel man , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` when i see even the most heinous beast suffer , i feel empathy . \\n▁ but - '' he took a stroll across the room . \\n▁ ` ` i refuse to feel empathy for that . '' \\n▁ ` ` david ? \\n▁ you - '' ` ` you will sit down , emily pierce , or you will suffer the queen 's fate along with her . '' \\n▁ emily sat down . \\n▁ ` ` i will leave instructions with the upper and lower house after i ' m gone . '' \\n▁ ` ` gone ? '' \\n▁ morgaine said . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ david stopped walking and placed both hands on the back of morg 's chair . \\n▁ ` ` once drake is dead - '' ` ` you 're still going to kill him ? '' \\n▁ i gasped . \\n▁ david 's eyes flicked my way once in annoyance , then he continued without answering me . \\n▁ ` ` then i will have the guards arrest her and she will bear the full weight of the law . \\n▁ once she 's endured her punishment , if she does so with grace , she will be reinstated and continue to rule the three worlds . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , you ca n't - '' ` ` i can do what i see fit , emily , '' he said through his teeth . \\n▁ ` ` she will suffer the consequences of her actions , and there will be no argument . \\n▁ this meeting is over . '' \\n▁ everyone stayed put , their mouths hung like frogs waiting for flies . \\n▁ ` ` and what about jason ? '' \\n▁ i asked , turning in my seat to face david . \\n▁ ` ` what are you going to do with him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i said , '' david repeated in a clipped tone . \\n▁ ` ` this meeting . \\n▁ is . \\n▁ over . '' \\n▁ forks scraped piercing sounds down china plates , while the gentle clatter of wineglasses and murmured dinner conversations gave the candlelit evening a sort of comfortable , almost homely feel , almost as if i could imagine nothing bad had happened yesterday , or as if weeks had passed instead of only hours since i told david about jason and i . \\n▁ at breakfast this morning , xxunk and walt openly discussed david 's move to a new room and how david had laughed it off , said it was nothing but a minor argument between he and i that would resolve itself in a few weeks . \\n▁ and now we sat at dinner , such little time having passed but with so much on my mind , that it felt like i 'd never left the table after breakfast . \\n▁ david chose to avoid me today , even going as far as to miss court , with a very valid excuse , of course . \\n▁ i 'd been looking forward to that moment when i might sit beside him on the throne , though , perhaps gauge his reaction to me , maybe see if there was any hope at all for forgiveness , even one day , years from now . \\n▁ but the way he looked at me as we sat down to dinner killed all that hope . \\n▁ i swallowed each bite of my meal with the massive lump that had formed in my throat , not sure anything of substance was actually hitting my stomach . \\n▁ i felt wildly sick and hungry - about as hungry as a pauper roaming winter streets , and every time i tried to join conversations , either david just flat - out ignored me , or morgaine cut me off whenever i opened my mouth . \\n▁ she 'd taken a side long before this jason business began , and it clearly was n't mine . \\n▁ in fact , i would n't be surprised at all if i woke to find her leaning over me in the dark with a dagger in her hand . \\n▁ david looked up from the other end of the table then , and raised his glass , bowing his head as if to say , ` ` i welcome the idea . '' \\n▁ stay out of my head , i thought . \\n▁ i ' m not there by choice , he thought back . \\n▁ i 'd rather lick walt 's moustache than be forced to listen to anything you have to think . \\n▁ i slinked lower in my seat , looking to jason for a single moment of reassurance . \\n▁ but his seat was empty , its occupant now assigned to stable duties until david decided what to do with him . \\n▁ even arthur was too distracted to offer a quick smile . \\n▁ in fact , the whole room was full of life and laughter , vampires and xxunk freely interacting and getting along , but the yellow of candlelight and the peaceful hum of conversation slowly turned into grey clouds and pouring rain above me , spitting my own misery out all over the table - wetting the food and the tablecloth , and flattening the hair to the head of each guest . \\n▁ but none of them noticed . \\n▁ david performed as his usual kingly self , talking with members of the upper house , his charming smile and glittering green eyes holding a captive audience as if everything he might say could be of great value . \\n▁ he was glowing , even though the night around us was otherwise shadowed with doom . \\n▁ no one would ' ve known by looking at him that he just had his heart ripped out of his chest . \\n▁ and that only made me love him more : he was always so good at playing the game - hiding things away on the inside for the greater good of the world outside . \\n▁ i could learn a thing or two from him . \\n▁ if he 'd ever speak to me again which , judging from the last twenty - four hours , i no longer existed as far as he was concerned . \\n▁ which one would expect , anyway - after what i did . \\n▁ but it still hurt so amazingly bad that everything we had just blew away in the wind , like the flash from a camera . \\n▁ just gone . \\n▁ never was . \\n▁ never will be again . \\n▁ none of that mattered to me , though , not the way he 'd acted today , or anything cruel he 'd said to me . \\n▁ i knew , deep in my heart , that love could n't die overnight . \\n▁ he still loved me somewhere in that soul of his , and i was n't about to give up on him . \\n▁ not yet . \\n▁ not while - ` ` morgaine ? '' \\n▁ david said , laying his wineglass on the table just above his plate . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sire ? '' \\n▁ ` ` our queen looks rather ill , would n't you say ? '' \\n▁ morgaine appraised me critically , then nodded in agreement . \\n▁ ` ` i think she does . '' \\n▁ ` ` she looks fine , '' blade cut in . \\n▁ ` ` no , in fact , i rather think she looks as if she needs to lie down , '' david said , and winked at morg . \\n▁ ` ` see that she makes it safely to her room . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course , sire . '' \\n▁ morgaine wiped her mouth and stood , huffing impatiently at me . \\n▁ ` ` amara ? '' \\n▁ i looked at mike , then at falcon , who stood and pushed his chair in . \\n▁ ` ` oh , you need n't follow , falcon . '' \\n▁ david said , raising a hand . \\n▁ ` ` morgaine will attend to the queen . '' \\n▁ ` ` the hell she will , '' falcon snapped , bowing politely after . \\n▁ ` ` your majesty . '' \\n▁ the fire of authority flamed in david 's gaze . \\n▁ he practically scorched falcon with it , clearly plotting a million punishments he could inflict on my overprotective guard for daring to go against him - in public especially . \\n▁ my heart beat so fiercely in my chest i could taste the blood in my throat . \\n▁ i knew david wanted to challenge falcon , but he calmed himself instead and took a more honourable approach . \\n▁ ` ` very well . '' \\n▁ he offered me to falcon . \\n▁ ` ` see that she stays in her room for the remainder of the evening . \\n▁ would n't want anyone else catching whatever she 's carrying . '' \\n▁ a few dinner guests nodded and chattered in polite agreement , not seeing david 's dismissal for what it was . \\n▁ ` ` come on . '' \\n▁ falcon appeared at my side , shoving morg away as he hauled me gently to stand by my arm . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i slammed my hands on the table . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sick , david . \\n▁ and i ' m not going to bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's where you 're wrong , ara . \\n▁ you are sick , disgustingly sick . \\n▁ and unless you care to tell our guests what your ailment is , perhaps you should take my advice . '' \\n▁ he presented the room full of people , flashing me a grin so smug i wanted to hit him . \\n▁ i grabbed a potato off my plate instead and ditched it hard toward his head , realising what i 'd done only as it left my hand and flew past the stunned guests , making the flames on the candelabra 's flicker momentarily before exploding on the back of david 's chair , right beside his ear . \\n▁ ` ` how dare you ! '' \\n▁ he stood up , tossing his napkin down , but before he could storm over here and punish me , mike , blade , quaid , and ryder stood , too , ready to challenge him . \\n▁ i eyed my guard nervously , looking from each one of their stern gazes locked to david , then back at the king . \\n▁ it was a standoff . \\n▁ none of them had the right to challenge him , but all of them were more than willing to . \\n▁ and i loved each of them so dearly in that moment . \\n▁ ` ` david , '' arthur said softly , wiping his mouth before slowly standing up . \\n▁ ` ` it seems our young queen is overtired . \\n▁ i 'll take her up to bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` best you do , uncle , '' david said coldly , dusting potato mash off his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` before i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ falcon took my arm , leaning in close to whisper , ` ` you better just go . '' \\n▁ i nodded , stepping away from my chair , walking backward a few steps until the guests slowly began their gentle , polite chatter again , acting as if nothing happened , while david stood at the head of the table , his eyes black with fury . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't say he did n't deserve it , '' arthur said , catching up on the other side of the doors . \\n▁ ` ` but you should have more self - control . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m a human - being , arthur , in part . \\n▁ and i have rights . \\n▁ he ca n't order me to bed like some child just because he does n't want to listen to my thoughts . '' \\n▁ i pointed back toward the great hall . \\n▁ ` ` imagine if i tried to do something like that to him . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're absolutely right , '' he said with a nod . \\n▁ ` ` he was being petty , but you must n't stoop to his level . '' \\n▁ ` ` easier said than done , '' i scoffed . \\n▁ ` ` besides , i think she went a little below his level , arthur , '' falcon said , holding back the obvious humour in his tone . \\n▁ ` ` but she gets points for the look on david 's face when that potato hit the chair . '' \\n▁ even arthur laughed then . \\n▁ ` ` it 's safe to say no girl has ever been brave enough to do that before . '' \\n▁ ` ` i feel bad now , though , '' i said , hugging myself . \\n▁ ` ` do n't . '' \\n▁ falcon guided me along with a hand to my shoulder blade . \\n▁ ` ` he really did have that coming , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` if it were me , '' arthur said , ` ` i 'd have thrown the steak . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , it was a bit tough tonight , was n't it ? '' \\n▁ falcon agreed , both of them laughing again . \\n▁ but i could n't laugh . \\n▁ i did n't even want to . \\n▁ chapter twelve the majesty of life made the ancient trees feel taller , the wind cooler , and the nakedness of my body pure and unsullied . \\n▁ i was never any freer or any more beautiful than when i left the confines of human convention behind and wandered under the great evergreens of the enchanted forest . \\n▁ nothing changed about my physical appearance when i came here : my feet still connected with the earth , my toes sticking to the dewy leaves carpeting the floor , but somehow i just never felt quite as solid . \\n▁ the night still owned this part of the forest , daylight only showing in small flickers here and there in the distance , or through waving leaves in the canopy above . \\n▁ the sun was well and truly up now , but my heart , i think , kept the forest shadowed , hiding things inside me that i was n't ready to awaken . \\n▁ fears . \\n▁ worries . \\n▁ heartache . \\n▁ i walked on , taking the long way to the stone altar , in no hurry today to get back to my life , but it came into sight up ahead before i expected : a simple grey boulder , seemingly unremarkable , yet as i reached the clearing , the warmth emanating off its surface , rising from the very core , reached out to greet me , healing broken parts of my soul in a way no other living thing could . \\n▁ ideas and thoughts that had previously only been suspicions felt like shiny marbles behind glass partitions - finally visible . \\n▁ none of it looked as confusing . \\n▁ and while i had n't drawn any conclusions about the questions i asked when i came to visit the mother , i did get the sense that they were leading me down the right track to the answer . \\n▁ sometimes , jase had told me once , reaching a conclusion is not so much about seeking the answer , but knowing which questions to ask . \\n▁ ` ` he always was a smart boy , that jason . '' \\n▁ i looked down from the treetops to a pair of shiny black eyes , set on the sides of a very scaly face . \\n▁ ` ` you . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i mean , it 's you : you 're the one who was - '' ` ` guiding you on your walk of faith . '' \\n▁ ` ` who - '' i stepped closer . \\n▁ ` ` who are you ? '' \\n▁ it looked off to one side like it was exasperated , shifting its long body then from where rested on the stone to an almost standing , kind of human position , changing , reshaping until wings popped out on its back and its body shrunk before my eyes , resembling a butterfly . \\n▁ ` ` i am the mother of earth - of all life , young goddess . \\n▁ you ' ve spoken with me many times . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i ' ve never seen your face . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you are still yet to be allowed that privilege , xxunk , '' she said , changing again , her form wavering like heat on pavement at a distance , and when my eyelids shifted up from a blink , a tiny blue bird sat before me . \\n▁ ` ` i have many faces . \\n▁ some you have seen before , some you will see again . '' \\n▁ ` ` why have you come here today ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` child , you understand so little of the world you rule . '' \\n▁ she looked around . \\n▁ ` ` i have not come here today . \\n▁ i am in all things . \\n▁ i am life , breath , i am the trees and the grass . \\n▁ i am you . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , yeah , but what i meant is … '' i walked a little closer . \\n▁ ` ` why have you chosen a physical form for me to address ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i am here to give an answer . '' \\n▁ ` ` to what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the question you just asked . '' \\n▁ ` ` i asked a question ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ she leaped off the stone with a graceful flap of her wing and appeared behind me as a butterfly again . \\n▁ ` ` follow me . '' \\n▁ ` ` where are we going ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to seek the answer . '' \\n▁ ` ` what was the question ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when you see the answer , you may remember the question . '' \\n▁ i followed her , walking slowly through this sacred land , both of us greeting the birds and the bugs as we passed . \\n▁ when we came to the border where i left my clothes , the butterfly perched itself on a tree branch . \\n▁ ` ` why are we here , mother ? '' \\n▁ ` ` look beyond the answer to find the question , xxunk . \\n▁ you ask yourself this many times a day , and every visit to this forest has had the one question in mind , beneath all others . '' \\n▁ ` ` how will i know if i ' m asking the right question to the answer you give ? \\n▁ and what is the answer ? '' \\n▁ ` ` look up , xxunk . \\n▁ the answer is staring at you . '' \\n▁ ` ` why do you do that ? '' \\n▁ jase asked , leaning on a tree nearby with his arms folded . \\n▁ ` ` oh , shit . '' \\n▁ i covered my br * * sts with my hands , squatting down on the spot to hide the other bits i did n't want him to see . \\n▁ jase laughed and appeared behind me , wrapping his over - shirt around my back . \\n▁ ` ` seriously ? \\n▁ why do you walk naked ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's … '' i stood up , closing the shirt across my front . \\n▁ ` ` clothes are a distraction , sort of . \\n▁ when i ' m naked , the , i guess , ` ` voice of nature '' comes through so clearly . \\n▁ it 's almost like i can hear the whispers of the universe . '' \\n▁ ` ` kind of like why the walk of faith was always done naked ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i nodded , folding over a bit so the shirt covered any hair i would n't normally show . \\n▁ ` ` it 's out of respect , really , as if to hide your true form is to be ashamed of it . '' \\n▁ he bit his lips together , trying not to laugh . \\n▁ ` ` and now you ' ve lost your clothes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` shut up , jase . '' \\n▁ i slapped his chest . \\n▁ ` ` relax . '' \\n▁ he laughed , jumping back a few steps . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve already seen you naked . '' \\n▁ we stood there then , just looking at each other , and the longer we looked , the less naked i felt . \\n▁ i stood a little bit taller , letting my arms fall loosely to my sides . \\n▁ jase took a jagged breath as the shirt parted slightly and showed my milky white skin in places he did n't usually see - just a thin line down the centre of my body , revealing the bone between my br * * sts , my belly button , and the apex of my thighs . \\n▁ and he was n't strong and noble and wise to me then ; he looked scared and young , and so adorably timid i almost laughed . \\n▁ ` ` it does n't mean the same thing to me as it does to you , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nakedness , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not sexual for me . \\n▁ not out here . '' \\n▁ he looked around the forest , nodding . \\n▁ ` ` ca n't say i feel the same way . '' \\n▁ i smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ no one was supposed to be around . '' \\n▁ he kept the nod going , clearly suffering under his external cool . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . \\n▁ i am suffering . '' \\n▁ he took a few steps away and started digging under leaves and branches . \\n▁ ` ` let 's just find your clothes . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ he looked up , a little shocked that i was suddenly behind him , and closed the shirt as he stood up right in front of me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be nervous around me . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , i am in love you . \\n▁ it might not mean anything to you to be naked right in front of my eyes , '' he said with a small laugh . \\n▁ ` ` but it just makes me wan na hold you , and i ca n't . \\n▁ i know that . \\n▁ i know it 's not right . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` you do n't have to explain , jase . '' \\n▁ i lay my hand over his where it tightly capped the shirt closed . \\n▁ ` ` i know how you feel about me . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i do n't want to make you uncomfortable . '' \\n▁ he nodded , turning away . \\n▁ ` ` like i said , let 's just find your clothes , because i ' m not really sure how much longer i can control myself , ara . '' \\n▁ i wet my lips , shaking my head . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't need control . \\n▁ you have honour . '' \\n▁ ` ` honour means nothing when i just wan na slide my hand inside that shirt , all the way along your soft , naked hips , and pull you in close - hold you until all that pain i know you 're feeling goes away or , at least , does n't hurt so bad . '' \\n▁ my skin practically left my body then and jumped into his arms . \\n▁ i wanted that so badly , too . \\n▁ but more than i wanted jase , for once , i just wanted him to be david . \\n▁ ` ` i see . '' \\n▁ he nodded , his whole face shadowed with a frown . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's never changed , ara . '' \\n▁ he held both hands up when i went reached for him . \\n▁ ` ` and i ' m okay . \\n▁ i ' m not mad at you , or anything . \\n▁ i just … it 's never gon na change , is it ? \\n▁ not even now you 're free to be mine ? '' \\n▁ i slowly moved my head from side to side . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' he whispered so low i almost did n't hear . \\n▁ ` ` guess i should ' ve accepted that a long time ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase , wait , '' i called , but he turned and walked away at human pace , without looking back . \\n▁ the kitchen was quiet . \\n▁ all the staff were having lunch below the manor , my knights were all at training , and all my friends were off doing something of value . \\n▁ i sat at the table in the centre of the room , tapping my fingernails against the ceramic mug to make some noise and maybe blend out the loneliness i felt today , but it did n't work . \\n▁ mike 's brownies , however , did . \\n▁ well , maybe not with the loneliness - i took another bite and closed my eyes to savour the flavour - but they at least gave me a second of joy . \\n▁ eating something mike made , i guess , was like going home to visit your parents after growing up and moving out . \\n▁ ` ` so you 're going to eat your problems , '' david said , leaning in the doorway . \\n▁ i threw the brownie down and wiped my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know anyone was there . '' \\n▁ ` ` clearly . '' \\n▁ he walked in . \\n▁ ` ` that 's the fourth one you ' ve eaten . '' \\n▁ i looked at the plate . \\n▁ sure enough , i 'd gobbled up pretty much the whole batch . \\n▁ ` ` guess i was hungry . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you were n't . '' \\n▁ he moved over and stood beside me , closer than he 'd been to me in days . \\n▁ ` ` you 're eating your problems , and it 's showing . '' \\n▁ ` ` showing ? '' \\n▁ i looked down , following his smug stare . \\n▁ ` ` do think i ' m the only one that 's noticed how fat you ' ve gotten ? '' \\n▁ my blood ran cold . \\n▁ i sucked my gut in . \\n▁ ` ` it 's just a little … '' ` ` disgusting . '' \\n▁ ` ` i was gon na say pot . '' \\n▁ i patted my belly . \\n▁ ` ` and , can you blame me ? '' \\n▁ his brows moved up his forehead and he scratched just beside his nose . \\n▁ ` ` no , i suppose not . \\n▁ you never really did have any self - control . '' \\n▁ ` ` i have plenty . '' \\n▁ i stood up . \\n▁ ` ` so what if i ' m putting on a little weight ? \\n▁ it 's not like i ' m fat . '' \\n▁ the smugness swathed his face then . \\n▁ he folded his arms and looked me up and down . \\n▁ ` ` you 're the fattest i ' ve ever seen you , and i got ta say , ara , it really does n't suit you . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's it , '' i said through my teeth , the rage moving through my chest , taking control of my arm . \\n▁ he caught me before my hand impacted his face , though , and held my wrist tight , his eyes locked to mine like stony caverns . \\n▁ ` ` you ever try something like again , '' he said , gliding into me . \\n▁ ` ` and i will do more than just catch your hand . \\n▁ do you understand me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't frighten me , '' i said , but my voice quivered . \\n▁ i came to rest with my spine against the wall , my gaze xxunk with his - hiding nothing of the fear he created in me . \\n▁ once , i knew him well , knew he 'd never hurt me . \\n▁ but now , i was n't really so sure . \\n▁ he looked down at my hand , his eyes fixing on the lone gold band around my ring finger . \\n▁ ` ` why are you still wearing that ? '' \\n▁ i jerked downward , trying to pull out of his grasp , but he held my hand in an iron grip and capped his fingertips around the ring , forcing it from my finger . \\n▁ ` ` david , do n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` you have no right to wear this . '' \\n▁ he held it up , taking a few long strides away from me . \\n▁ ` ` you lost that right the day you bedded my brother . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 're still married , '' i said , squaring my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` and xxunk do n't believe in divorce . \\n▁ so , like it or not , you 're stuck with me . '' \\n▁ ` ` let me get one thing monumentally straight - '' he stepped closer , his shoulders rounding to lower his face to mine . \\n▁ ` ` i am stuck with nothing . \\n▁ our bond may be by that of the law , ara , but you are in no way my wife . \\n▁ you mean nothing to me nor do the promises this ring xxunk . '' \\n▁ he held it up in a circle between his fingers . \\n▁ ` ` we may not be allowed to divorce , but make no mistake , we are not , nor shall we ever be again , husband and wife . \\n▁ and if i see this on your finger again , i will cut it off with the blade in my scabbard . '' \\n▁ he placed a hand to his knife for good measure . \\n▁ ` ` do i make myself clear ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , squeaking instead of speaking . \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ he rolled to stand tall again , ditching the gold band at my feet . \\n▁ ` ` now pull yourself together . \\n▁ we have court in ten minutes , and unless you want to be mutilated before my eyes , on this very day , we 'd better convey a united front . '' \\n▁ ` ` did n't know you cared . '' \\n▁ he stopped walking , but did n't turn around . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` since when ? '' \\n▁ i said . \\n▁ ` ` can you really just fall out of love with me that quickly ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` what about the boy i met at school ? '' \\n▁ i went to walk forward , deciding to stay put instead . \\n▁ ` ` what would he think to know you felt this way ? \\n▁ go back , david . \\n▁ remember us . \\n▁ remember what we felt then . \\n▁ do you really hate me so much you ca n't ever forgive me - forgive that girl you fell in love with ? '' \\n▁ both of us stood silently then . \\n▁ i could see his memories flashing and fighting against reality and perception - see him picture me in my yellow dress on the driveway of my dad 's house that first day i arrived . \\n▁ he 'd never seen anything so uniquely and perfectly matched to him and all his desires in his hundred years on this earth . \\n▁ he loved me then , and i felt the love surround that thought , but he cast it away quickly , smothering it with images he 'd clearly stolen from jason of the night he and i slept together , making me draw a breath . \\n▁ ` ` yes , ara , '' he said to the floor , still not turning around . \\n▁ ` ` yes to what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , love can die in an instant , '' he muttered coldly , walking away . \\n▁ i stood motionless , horrified over what he 'd seen in jason 's thoughts . \\n▁ it was n't much , just a few stilled images , clearly stolen when jason was n't in control . \\n▁ but it was enough to haunt david . \\n▁ and to haunt me . \\n▁ i toed the ring then , seeing the distance from here to floor as much greater than it actually was . \\n▁ and for that moment , i did n't even feel as if i had the right to pick the damn thing up . \\n▁ he took it from me - threw it to the ground like it was nothing . \\n▁ because it was nothing , i guess . \\n▁ he was right . \\n▁ all the promises we made gave that ring life , and without them , it was just a plain gold band . \\n▁ it meant nothing . \\n▁ i turned and walked away , too , leaving it behind on the floor . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * despite personal grievances , neither david nor i let them get in the way of our duty to the people . \\n▁ we politely took the back seat when the other was standing before the court , deciding the fate of lawbreakers , and it seemed we 'd worked out an unspoken system for who ruled on what . \\n▁ david left the humanitarian cases up to me , and anything involving or requiring harsher punishments were left for him . \\n▁ but when those doors closed at the back of the throne room and court had ended for the day , cold , dark david returned , speaking no words to me . \\n▁ i 'd turned and offered him a smile - a kind of truce , but he did not accept . \\n▁ he just checked my finger to see that i 'd obeyed him and , once satisfied , hurried from the room . \\n▁ i did n't even bother to tell him i left the ring on the floor in the kitchen where he threw it . \\n▁ i did n't have the heart to touch it again , not when it now symbolised so many mistakes and so much heartache . \\n▁ someone would find it and return it to me , and i could play dumb - say i 'd lost it when i was washing my hands . \\n▁ but at least , for now , i did n't have to tell anyone david forbid me to wear it . \\n▁ and the lie - losing it - was easier to carry than the truth . \\n▁ then again , maybe i should have picked it up and kept it in my pocket . \\n▁ it 'd only been three days since my confession . \\n▁ i could n't really expect miracles . \\n▁ the fact that we could rule with civility between us was divine intervention enough . \\n▁ i rolled onto my back , fluffing my pillows under my head , then just laid watching the sky outside change from black to dark blue - the stars slowly fading out group by group until dawn was on the horizon . \\n▁ i was n't sure if i wanted to walk out and meet with mother nature this morning . \\n▁ although it always recharged me , made me feel as though i 'd slept when i had n't , or that i was well when i felt ill , i just did n't feel as if i could be bothered . \\n▁ i went there day after day , trying to find a way to stop david using the dagger on drake , but the mother only seemed to want to talk about jason . \\n▁ i thought maybe jase was the answer , the key to saving david , but i just did n't know how . \\n▁ then again , maybe she was n't all that concerned about losing david . \\n▁ maybe she was trying to tell me i should be with jason . \\n▁ who knew ? \\n▁ i was never really good at riddles . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ i sat bolt upright , searching the darkness for the voice when , across the sitting room , a creaky door slammed shut and someone whispered profanity at the sudden loud noise . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? \\n▁ is that you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ a lamp came on beside him . \\n▁ he stood there by the secret entrance beside the fireplace , his charmingly sheepish smile sending the jitters and ghosts of my instant reaction away . \\n▁ i flopped back for a second and breathed out . \\n▁ ` ` you scared the crap out of me . '' \\n▁ ` ` sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's almost dawn . '' \\n▁ he nodded to the window . \\n▁ ` ` figured you 'd be headed out for your usual walk soon . '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' i sat up and hugged my knees to my chest , resting my chin on them ` ` i was n't planning on going today . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ he asked , strolling over , with both hands concealing something behind his back . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been thinking . '' \\n▁ ` ` about ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david never really had a great life . \\n▁ i mean , neither of you did . '' \\n▁ ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ he sat down beside me , making the bed dip a little , as if he were human and gravity had any bearing on him . \\n▁ ` ` he 's a good king . \\n▁ he loves what he does , and he … '' ` ` you still do n't want him to die for you , do you ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` seems pointless . \\n▁ there 's never gon na be a baby now , so … '' ` ` that 's not it , ara , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not doing this to protect the child . \\n▁ he 's doing it because he 's got nothing left to live for . '' \\n▁ ` ` he has a monarchy . \\n▁ he has his uncle . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` you do n't get it . '' \\n▁ he smiled at me , making all his lovely white teeth visible . \\n▁ ` ` he has n't got you . '' \\n▁ i thought about that for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i understand that . \\n▁ but why does he care ? \\n▁ he does n't want me anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's … he 's lost faith . \\n▁ he never believed in happiness until he found you , ara . \\n▁ and now that 's gone , he thinks he 'll never find it again . \\n▁ he does n't really see any reason to stick around . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , he does n't get to make that decision . '' \\n▁ ` ` try to stop him , '' jase said , and we both smirked , shaking our heads . \\n▁ ` ` he 's impossible , is n't he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you did n't have to grow up with him . '' \\n▁ i laughed out through my nose , then nodded at the package behind his back . \\n▁ ` ` so , what you got there ? '' \\n▁ ` ` gift ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what kind of gift ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for you , '' he said , presenting it with a nod of his head . \\n▁ i took it in my lap and considered it for a second : it was square , fat , velvet - red , all bound neatly with a silky black ribbon . \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` open it , silly . '' \\n▁ the knot slipped apart like water over glass , and fell away from the velvet with only one small pull . \\n▁ ` ` i thought you could wear it when you go walking in the forest , rather than trying to find your clothes again every time , '' jase explained . \\n▁ ` ` it 's bright , easy to see , and i figure you can hang it off a branch or something . '' \\n▁ i held up the cloth and my mouth opened in shock as it unravelled in heavy layers . \\n▁ ` ` it 's … jase , it 's beautiful . '' \\n▁ ` ` wan na try it on ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'd love to . '' \\n▁ he stood up and took the cloak , holding it out for me . \\n▁ i wriggled out from under my warm covers and pulled my nightdress down over my undies , turning my back so he could cloak me . \\n▁ and it wrapped my shoulders like a blanket , kind of heavy and warm , with that new fabric smell to it , as if it 'd just come from the tailor . \\n▁ ` ` it 's perfect , jase . '' \\n▁ i turned around to face him . \\n▁ he tied the ribbon up just under my collarbones , drawing the hood over my head after . \\n▁ ` ` and it 'll keep you warm , too , when it gets colder out . '' \\n▁ i looked up at him from under the cloak , changing the smile in his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome , ara . '' \\n▁ he leaned in and kissed my head , then pulled away as if gravity were forcing us together . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll see ya later , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i watched him leave through the secret door , standing in the darkness of a dawning day as if i could slow it down or make it go away . \\n▁ this one would be like the next , and so on and so on , until , one day , david would take that dagger and kill drake , and i would wake up to the rising sun , but i 'd never really see the light again . \\n▁ david did n't want to live now that he 'd lost hope . \\n▁ and i did n't want to live in a world without him . \\n▁ there was only one way to solve this issue now - one way i could save david . \\n▁ if there was no contract , drake would n't be a threat . \\n▁ and if there was no me , there could be no contract . \\n▁ i tossed the cloak aside and ripped my clothes off . \\n▁ the solution had been staring me in the face the whole time . \\n▁ he did n't need to die if there was nothing to die for . \\n▁ he could have the life he always wanted . \\n▁ it would be my gift to him for saving me from the darkness i sunk into all those years ago after i lost my mom - the same darkness i 'd never really escaped . \\n▁ i owed him this much . \\n▁ for all the pain i 'd caused him , and for all the love i would eternally feel for him , i at least owed him a future as king . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * quaid stood as i opened my door . \\n▁ ` ` morning , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` morning , quaid . '' \\n▁ ` ` off for your dawn walk ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yup . '' \\n▁ i closed my door , fastening the cloak around my naked body . \\n▁ ` ` you can head off for a coffee break , if you like . '' \\n▁ he stuffed his phone in his pocket and flashed me a toothy grin . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll see ya in an hour . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i tried to smile . \\n▁ ` ` see ya then . \\n▁ oh , and , kumar ? '' \\n▁ he 'd taken leave quite eagerly , but when i addressed him like that , he stopped and very slowly turned around to face me . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` could you hold onto this for me ? '' \\n▁ i reached into the little side pocket and pulled out a small handwritten note . \\n▁ ` ` i was going to give it to jason later , but i do n't want to lose it in the forest . '' \\n▁ he took the note and thumbed the edge , his eyes staying on it . \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just a letter , '' i said casually and walked past him , holding my head high , even though i just wanted to break apart inside . \\n▁ of all the people i was leaving behind , i knew it would hurt jase the most . \\n▁ i did n't know who to write a farewell letter to , but i knew anything i wanted to say to anyone i cared about would be passed on by jason . \\n▁ he was the only one i could truly trust . \\n▁ and i knew i could trust quaid to give it to him . \\n▁ the red cloak brought me comfort as i glided like frost over the slated floors toward the throne room , passing beneath the cold arches of the manor , blending with the blue shadows of dawn . \\n▁ the words to my letter moved across my lips like a prayer , travelling with the hopes that each farewell would find its recipient . \\n▁ especially david . \\n▁ there were few words i could offer him as goodbye , and not once did i use the word ` sorry . ' \\n▁ he knew , deep down , that i was sorry and that what i did would slowly and surely have destroyed me more than it did him . \\n▁ i did n't need to tell him that . \\n▁ one day , centuries from now , when he found someone else to love , he would wake and realise all that i would have said anyway . \\n▁ only then would it mean he was ready to listen . \\n▁ the great throne room doors opened gracefully , as if welcoming my footfalls to the road ahead . \\n▁ here , i began my journey home again . \\n▁ here , i would farewell my past and all the mistakes , and move forward . \\n▁ finally free . \\n▁ i left the cloak at the base of the hill outside and entered the forest in my pure form , closing my eyes and feeling the energy of nature guide me , gliding through the base of the trees like wind at my feet . \\n▁ it moved me forward quickly , sending word a breath ahead that i was on my way home - that i was coming to return to the place we all once began . \\n▁ ` ` spirits of the forest , '' i whispered , ` ` show me how to return to that which created me . '' \\n▁ the world went silent , the breeze dying away with the song of birds , and the leaves in the trees coming to a standstill , all waiting as if holding their breath , watching as the spirit of mother earth made herself known in this place . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and imagined her there by the stone up ahead , with open arms welcoming me . \\n▁ and i knew what to do - as if her voice itself whispered the answer in my ear . \\n▁ one foot over the other , i walked at a pace respectful to the flow and ease of all things living , existing , breathing this world of life in the rhythm of nature . \\n▁ and as i came upon the stone , fell to my knees and swiped a nail tip across the centre of my palm , drawing blood to the surface of my skin . \\n▁ she wanted it back - mother who guarded the gateway between worlds . \\n▁ one must offer blood for anything asked of this stone . \\n▁ i understood that now . \\n▁ life , knowledge , magic : all of it could be mine for the exchange of this substance inside me that was connected more richly to the earth at our feet than this very platform in front of me . \\n▁ i laid my hand to the stone and felt it reach up , felt the life force inside it move to the blood on my palm and draw it away . \\n▁ ` ` take me home , '' i whispered my hot breath into the rock . \\n▁ ` ` free me from the binds of this world so that i might save my people - save the king . '' \\n▁ i waited , imagining for a moment how jase would react to my letter , imagining how relieved he 'd feel . \\n▁ i knew relief was n't what i 'd be leaving behind , but after some time passed , i knew everyone would see that this was for the best . \\n▁ one day they would come to understand why i did this . \\n▁ i 'd failed at so many things , and for once in my life , i would die getting something right . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , '' a ghostly voice said . \\n▁ i did n't need to look up . \\n▁ did n't need to see where she stood . \\n▁ i could feel her beside me , feel her touch on my skin . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and smiled . \\n▁ ` ` mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` young xxunk , defender of all natural things , protector of this realm . \\n▁ why do you seek to free yourself of your claim ? '' \\n▁ i placed my other hand to my bare chest . \\n▁ ` ` i broke him . \\n▁ i hurt him deeper than any soul should ever hurt , mother . \\n▁ i ca n't save his heart , but i at least owe him his life . '' \\n▁ ` ` a wise decision , young goddess . \\n▁ but not the only path that was laid at your feet . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yet , it 's the one i ' m choosing . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what of her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` her ? '' \\n▁ i asked , trying hard not to open my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` your child . '' \\n▁ ` ` there is no child . '' \\n▁ i felt her touch become warmer , almost as if i could feel her smile . \\n▁ ` ` would you still want to die if i told you i foresee a child in your future ? '' \\n▁ i swallowed , my bleeding hand stinging now , going cold as the connection to the earth flickered , fading . \\n▁ ` ` david wo n't give me a child now , and even if he did , i ca n't stop drake from taking her , not if he lives . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ! '' \\n▁ a desperate voice hollered through the dawn shadows , stealing the tranquillity for a second . \\n▁ i turned my head and looked for the mother , but there was only warmth there where i imagined her . \\n▁ ` ` hurry , '' i pleaded . \\n▁ ` ` take me now before they come . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ! '' \\n▁ it called again , and beyond the fog i saw faces , sharpening and taking shape before my eyes : mike , quaid , emily , arthur , and jason . \\n▁ ` ` grab her , mike ! '' \\n▁ emily cried . \\n▁ ` ` do n't ! '' \\n▁ i ordered , my voice coming through my lips in a deep , almost baritone whisper . \\n▁ ` ` only an xxunk can enter here now . \\n▁ you 'll die , mike . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , please , '' he begged , taking a step closer . \\n▁ ` ` do n't touch me . '' \\n▁ i aimed my finger toward him , the command of my voice stopping him in his tracks . \\n▁ he looked down at his feet , trying to move them , but they would n't shift . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve made my choice , '' i said , searching their eyes as my gaze travelled over each face . \\n▁ ` ` this is the only way . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ jason stepped into sight , reaching out to me but not daring to come close . \\n▁ ` ` i read the letter . \\n▁ i know , '' he said , his eyes holding the weight of everything i told him . \\n▁ ` ` i know , okay , and you do n't have to do this . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m the only one nobody will miss , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , ara . '' \\n▁ he dropped quickly to a squat , covering his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` please do n't think that way . \\n▁ you matter to me , okay . \\n▁ more than anything in this world , sweet girl , and i 'll die without you . \\n▁ you ca n't go . '' \\n▁ i turned back , laying my other hand on the stone . \\n▁ ` ` it 's already done . '' \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ he cried , and my heart skipped a beat when arthur sternly said david 's name , telling him to do what he had to do . \\n▁ i could feel david here with me then - feel him connected to the earth through me . \\n▁ but it did n't matter . \\n▁ none of them could touch me . \\n▁ none of them had the power . \\n▁ i was completely wrapped up in the hands of my maker , already wedged between this world and the next . \\n▁ i focused harder on my hands , feeling my wrists and arms go through and touch the world on the other side . \\n▁ and it felt like magic , like a warm , happy feeling right in the centre of my chest . \\n▁ every problem i ever had just fell away then , like petals off a dying rose , making me laugh for that moment . \\n▁ we all took things so seriously there in that world , and as i looked upon the other realm , i realised as deep as my soul was living , that on this side , nothing mattered - not the past , not our mistakes , not our failings as humans , and not our regrets . \\n▁ here , we were all just life without consciousness . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ i looked down to the cool , familiar hands wrapping my ribs - smooth against my pale , naked skin , and both of us stared for a moment , open - mouthed as the black mark of my betrayal faded under his touch , bubbling and xxunk back into my body . \\n▁ ` ` david , let me go . \\n▁ please . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't go , ara . \\n▁ i need to take you back . '' \\n▁ i looked up from his hands at the blue light surrounding my body shining across his face . \\n▁ ` ` one of us has to die . '' \\n▁ ` ` and it 's not going to be you , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` you have a responsibility to your people . '' \\n▁ ` ` they 're your people now . '' \\n▁ i turned back to the stone , readying myself for the last breath . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ now , we do this my way , '' david growled , and the skin peeled suddenly from hands , detaching at the elbows as he tore me away , my own cries of agony drowning out the horror in those around me . \\n▁ ` ` let me go ! '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he cradled my body to his , carrying me from the circle of light to the darkest patch of forest by the trees . \\n▁ i screamed for the searing in my arms and soul - feeling it snap back into my body like a sharp elastic band . \\n▁ i could n't breathe , could n't get a grasp on this realm - slipping between death and life intermittently . \\n▁ david dumped me on the ground and stood back . \\n▁ ` ` what have you done ? '' \\n▁ arthur cried out , falling to his knees , his hands hovering over my body . \\n▁ ` ` she was too far gone . '' \\n▁ david stood above me , a shadow in the now red light of the stone 's protest . \\n▁ ` ` i had to rip her from that world . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve left half the girl 's goddamn flesh behind , '' arthur yelled . \\n▁ ` ` she 'll survive , '' david said calmly . \\n▁ i shuddered , feeling my soul connect completely with my body again , making the agony real - fiery , like hell had risen through the crack in the gateway david left open , and now ran fury among my limbs . \\n▁ ` ` make it stop , '' i cried , folding in on myself . \\n▁ ` ` make it stop . '' \\n▁ ` ` move . '' \\n▁ david pushed arthur and emily aside , and bent down to pick up a rock ; my eyes followed his hand to the rise above his shoulder , closing as the stone came down bluntly across my head . \\n▁ long , dark hair wavered along a breeze i could n't feel , the pale pink dress , like torn threads of ancient fabric , weaving and waving with a life of its own from her delicate , feminine form . \\n▁ her warmth spoke her name to a place inside me where faces were not xxunk of those we know , but rather the ` knowing ' that showed us who we were by seeing those we were familiar with . \\n▁ ` ` where are we ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` in the world beyond thought , '' the mother said , showing me all that surrounded us - just a foggy white world with no ground or sky to show up from down . \\n▁ ` ` am i dead ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ you will wake soon to a room of people who love you - people who refused to let you walk with me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ she tilted my chin upward . \\n▁ ` ` you must not be sorry , child , for anything . \\n▁ you are a great and wise queen , and you have done those before you proud . '' \\n▁ i smiled softly . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know it comes as a shock to you to get something right , for once , but everything you have done up until now - all the good and the bad - has been written in the stars , amara . \\n▁ your spirit had much to learn . '' \\n▁ ` ` so it was all a lesson ? \\n▁ everything ? \\n▁ the suffering , the - '' ` ` as it is for all god 's creatures . '' \\n▁ i shook my head for a second or two , remembering suddenly what she told me before i crossed over . \\n▁ ` ` you mentioned a child . '' \\n▁ ` ` i did . '' \\n▁ her lips closed , her eyes shrinking into a pleasant smile . \\n▁ ` ` she will bring an end to everything that began centuries ago , and we have gone to great lengths to preserve that future for you , xxunk - called on the mightiest power of nature to ensure its survival . '' \\n▁ ` ` survival ? '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ her hand moved slowly across the space between us and landed on my belly . \\n▁ ` ` you will see soon enough . '' \\n▁ ` ` when ? '' \\n▁ ` ` once you open your eyes , your world will change , and you will walk a new path now , child - one you are finally ready for . '' \\n▁ ` ` how do you know i ' m ready ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you faced many truths in coming to the decision you made this morning . \\n▁ each one of those showed us how much you have truly grown into the woman we hoped you 'd become . \\n▁ and , one of those truths , as fate would have it , has set you free from a bind you tied yourself in . '' \\n▁ ` ` what bind ? '' \\n▁ she removed her hand from my belly . \\n▁ ` ` your greatest gift in this realm is the heart , xxunk . \\n▁ you betrayed yourself , your birth right , and your crown by denying it . '' \\n▁ ` ` denying it ? '' \\n▁ i thought for a second , then rolled my eyes , keeping them closed after . \\n▁ ` ` jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is a sin against god to lie to those you love , but an even greater sin to lie to yourself . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what is the lie , mother ? \\n▁ what did - '' ` ` you want to love him . '' \\n▁ she shook her head , a smile warming her whole face . \\n▁ ` ` you do love him , and you can not deny this any longer . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't deny it . \\n▁ but i do n't have to accept it . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you do not . \\n▁ you , like all god 's creatures , were born with the gift free will . \\n▁ but , jason 's love is a gift also , and you can do with it what you wish , however , you must not hide the way you feel . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , i need to admit it to him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you already did , and you admitted it to yourself . \\n▁ now - '' she presented my waist , ` ` you are free . '' \\n▁ i looked down and slowly lifted my top , but she stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` you are blessed in that your soul is not bound to one eternal love . \\n▁ you can bind yourself to any soul you see fit . \\n▁ you will not spend your life seeking that significant other in order to find peace . \\n▁ but do not waste this blessing on lies . \\n▁ live for those you truly love - the ones who truly deserve your love in return . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what about david ? \\n▁ is he blessed with a free soul - one that has no significant other ? '' \\n▁ she shook her head slowly . \\n▁ ` ` am i. . . '' \\n▁ i touched my chest . \\n▁ ` ` am i his significant other , his soul mate ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ i turned and went to cry into my hand , stopping with the warm touch of the mother on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` you must not cry for him . \\n▁ for , if you do , you must shed the same tears for the other who is tied to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the brother . '' \\n▁ ` ` wait … i ' m his soul mate too ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` those boys are one soul , divided in two . \\n▁ what one loves , the other will die for , too . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's … me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ i dropped my hand back down to my side . \\n▁ ` ` oh god . \\n▁ those poor boys . '' \\n▁ even the mother of all life had to laugh at that . \\n▁ ` ` my dear little goddess . \\n▁ this will not be an easy decision for you , but you must know that , when the time comes to choose , you will lose the one you push away . '' \\n▁ ` ` then i 'll be losing jason , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` because , even if the day comes where i decide i love him more than david - '' i shook my head , '' - i ca n't be with him , mother . \\n▁ i could never hurt david like that . '' \\n▁ she touched my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` then be prepared to suffer for a very long time . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` we should ' ve let her go , '' emily sobbed . \\n▁ i looked up - looked past the shimmering pink light of life before me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not her time , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` but how can she live now - in this world . \\n▁ how can she open her eyes and possibly ever smile again after what he just did to her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he had to do that , emily , '' mike said dully . \\n▁ ` ` she was in agony . '' \\n▁ ` ` then it should n't have been him to do it . '' \\n▁ emily sobbed again . \\n▁ ` ` he enjoyed it too much . \\n▁ did n't you see his face ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't be so stupid , '' falcon said . \\n▁ ` ` he acted out of duty . \\n▁ that 's all - or i 'd have been the first to step in . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i know him , falcon . \\n▁ he enjoyed it . \\n▁ if he really cared about stopping her pain , he should ' ve asked jason to get in her head and knock her out . '' \\n▁ ` ` he could n't . \\n▁ no one but the king could touch her . \\n▁ she was still connected to the other realm , '' morgaine said . \\n▁ emily 's lips were cold on the back of my hand with the tear - soaked kiss she placed there . \\n▁ ` ` it just breaks my heart that she thought that was the only way to end her suffering . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not why she did it , emily . \\n▁ she was trying to save david . '' \\n▁ ` ` he does n't deserve to be saved , '' she said , and my eyes flew open . \\n▁ i drew my hand away , scowling at her . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't get to decide that , emily . '' \\n▁ she sat back , sniffling , her eyes small with confusion . \\n▁ ` ` and you do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ because i am queen . '' \\n▁ emily went to speak , but she stopped when she saw what i felt radiating from my eyes , my skin , and my soul : i was right . \\n▁ i was the powerful being deemed godly by mother nature , and i was not to be trifled with . \\n▁ the decisions i made were in the best interests of my people , and that was the only reason even the mother of all life herself allowed me the passage to the other side . \\n▁ emily could argue with the old , human me all she wanted , but she could not argue with mother nature . \\n▁ ` ` all right . '' \\n▁ arthur stood and touched emily 's shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` everyone out . \\n▁ i need to talk with amara . '' \\n▁ em hesitated , but arthur 's eyes had this strong , kind of no nonsense edge to them then that offered a polite warning not to question him . \\n▁ he meant business , and everyone in the room knew it . \\n▁ they filed out one by one ; morg behind emily , quaid behind blade , and falcon last , offering me a sad kind of smile as he closed the door . \\n▁ i looked away , watching arthur instead as he took the seat beside me where emily had been . \\n▁ ` ` are you mad at me , arthur ? '' \\n▁ his eyes warmed , crinkling slightly on the edges . \\n▁ ` ` no , amara . \\n▁ i ' m proud of you . '' \\n▁ ` ` proud ? '' \\n▁ i looked up at the glass dome , confused . \\n▁ i had n't expected that . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve grown up so much since i first met you . '' \\n▁ his warm , so david - like hand took mine . \\n▁ ` ` i am … my gratitude toward you for doing everything in your power to save my nephew is beyond words . \\n▁ you ' ve not given up on him , amara , ever , and i do n't know even one person who 'd have had the strength or the heart to give their own life in exchange for a man that no longer loves them . '' \\n▁ i pouted mockingly . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll never give up on him , arthur . \\n▁ and i ' m not done trying to save him . \\n▁ there has to be a way . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` i read your letter . '' \\n▁ i stiffened a little . \\n▁ goodbye letters were never supposed to be discussed after death . \\n▁ ` ` that 's … kind of awkward . '' \\n▁ we both laughed . \\n▁ ` ` amara , what you told jason in that letter - '' ` ` i told him the truth . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i hope so . \\n▁ because he loves you , and those words have given him reason to want to live again . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i 'll believe that when he starts drinking lilithian pure blood at dinner . '' \\n▁ arthur scratched just beside his eye . \\n▁ ` ` he put his name on the list for dinner tonight . '' \\n▁ i drew my hand away from his and sat all the way up . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it was a mistake giving that letter to quaid if you intended it to be read after you were gone . '' \\n▁ ` ` he took it straight to jase , did n't he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he was n't born yesterday , amara . \\n▁ how do you think he ended up on the core in the first place ? '' \\n▁ ` ` damn having all these smart buggers around . '' \\n▁ i slapped the mattress , my still raw hand searing after . \\n▁ ` ` did anyone else read it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` only myself . '' \\n▁ ` ` and david ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` he refused . '' \\n▁ ` ` jason offered it to him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i did . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i saw jason running toward the throne room with quaid , no queen in sight , and i called to him , asked him what happened . \\n▁ his words echoed through the manor then , amara , that you 'd gone to take your own life , and before i could react , david was behind me . '' \\n▁ ` ` he heard ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he did . \\n▁ i offered the letter as proof . \\n▁ but he scrunched it up and pressed it into jason 's hand again , said farewells should not be written by those not going anywhere . '' \\n▁ he stopped for a second , his eyes narrowed as the memory clearly replayed . \\n▁ ` ` and he ran toward the stone alongside his brother . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but … although miss emily was pleased david had rescued you , i do n't believe it was - '' ` ` because he loves me ? '' \\n▁ i said , nodding to myself . \\n▁ ` ` more like so i do n't get the easy way out , right ? '' \\n▁ his lips made a thin line for a second . \\n▁ ` ` you know him too well . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , being married to someone will do that . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he said simply and his attention slowly wandered to the balcony and the morning outside . \\n▁ ` ` amara , my dear , when david pulled you away from the stone , i noticed something … missing . '' \\n▁ ` ` missing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed , fixing on my waist . \\n▁ ` ` the mark . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i smiled , running my hand over the blankets as if rubbing the mark away . \\n▁ ` ` it 's gone ? \\n▁ all of it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` apart from the smallest symbol just above your tailbone . '' \\n▁ ` ` what does it look like - or say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i did n't get the chance to inspect it . \\n▁ i only saw it as jason lifted you from the ground to carry you away . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , do you want to look now ? '' \\n▁ i sat forward a bit and motioned to my lower back . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m curious to - '' ` ` not now , my dear . \\n▁ the mark was n't what i needed to talk to you about . '' \\n▁ ` ` what is it then , arthur ? '' \\n▁ i lay back on my pillow , twisting my long hair into a knot beside my jaw . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't like that worried look . '' \\n▁ he changed it to a soft , reassuring smile . \\n▁ ` ` nothing is wrong , but i fear i have some news that … '' he seemed to stop and think for a second , xxunk that : ` ` that may or may not upset you . '' \\n▁ ` ` but more likely will ? '' \\n▁ he sat back , but as he went to speak , my door popped open and jason said , ` ` knock - knock . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase . '' \\n▁ i pushed my good hand into the mattress under me and sat up again . \\n▁ ` ` hi . '' \\n▁ ` ` hi . \\n▁ can i come in ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ ` ` close the door , '' arthur said , waving a hand across the air . \\n▁ ` ` sure . '' \\n▁ the door shut and jason appeared on my other side , dragging a chair closer to the bed . \\n▁ ` ` how 's the hands ? '' \\n▁ i held them out . \\n▁ ` ` better . \\n▁ this one 's healed , but - '' i showed him my left hand . \\n▁ he cringed melodramatically . \\n▁ ` ` want some blood ? '' \\n▁ ` ` actually , i really do . \\n▁ but i better order a sacrificial . '' \\n▁ ` ` nonsense , '' arthur cussed . \\n▁ ` ` jason , feed the girl , and let 's get on with it . '' \\n▁ jason shrugged as if to say , ` ` do n't argue with the boss , '' and i drew a long breath to steady my heart . \\n▁ his vein was open and his wrist at my lips before i exhaled , and the sweet , mildly aphrodisiac quality of his life force ran down my throat , through my body , and made my damaged hand tingle . \\n▁ i did n't want to look at jase 's face while i drank from him - didn ' t want to see those eyes , see how much he was enjoying this , because i knew it would only make me want to bite him and , after tonight , he would finally be immune . \\n▁ we were finally free to be together , if i decided to take that road . \\n▁ and that just sent a hundred hot ideas into my mind . \\n▁ ` ` shh , '' he said , one hand sweeping my hair back softly , over and over . \\n▁ i had n't made any noise , that i knew of , so i could only figure he heard all of that . \\n▁ i drew my lips away from the wetness of his skin , wiping my mouth with the cup of my palm . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't mention it , '' he said , his eyes locked with a smile onto mine , his hand staying firmly on my head . \\n▁ ` ` how 's it feel now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it ? '' \\n▁ he motioned down to my hand . \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ um . '' \\n▁ i frayed my fingers and watched the last of the raw skin heal over like clouds passing the sun . \\n▁ ` ` it 's good now . '' \\n▁ ` ` good , '' arthur cut in . \\n▁ ` ` then we need to talk . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i settled down in my bed a bit . \\n▁ ` ` bad news ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , ara . \\n▁ brilliant news , '' jase said , his eyes lighting up then in an almost opposite way to arthur 's . \\n▁ ` ` sweet girl . \\n▁ you 're pregnant . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i went to sit up again , but just stayed there with my hands poised to prop me up . \\n▁ ` ` since when ? '' \\n▁ ` ` since june , approximately , '' arthur said dully . \\n▁ ` ` you 're about seventeen weeks , '' jase added . \\n▁ ` ` seventeen ? \\n▁ but - '' i counted in my head . \\n▁ jason and i slept together , like , eight weeks ago . \\n▁ it was … ` ` it 's david 's baby , amara , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` but … '' it did n't make sense . \\n▁ none of it . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ the pregnancy test was negative . \\n▁ i do n't even have a belly … '' ` ` you 're lilithian . \\n▁ those tests measure certain hormones in human pregnancies . \\n▁ but , immortals do n't change the way humans do . \\n▁ yours wo n't show up on a test . \\n▁ and , as for the belly , well - '' arthur smiled fondly at my waist . \\n▁ ` ` you have a bit of bump . '' \\n▁ i laid both hands across it . \\n▁ it was so small it felt only as if i 'd exhaled heavily and puffed it out a little . \\n▁ i was n't anywhere near as big as my mom when she had harry . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure it 's david 's ? \\n▁ i mean , this belly is more like a. . . '' \\n▁ ` ` a first trimester belly , '' arthur nodded . \\n▁ ` ` lilith was the same , so i ' m told . \\n▁ at thirty weeks gestation , she barely looked twenty . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` i was pregnant when i tried to kill myself . '' \\n▁ ` ` and she 's okay . '' \\n▁ jason pulled my hand gently down from my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` she survived it , ara . \\n▁ she 's strong , and - '' ` ` you were only a few weeks pregnant when you jumped , '' arthur said . \\n▁ ` ` it is my opinion that the life force in the blood of immortals kept her alive for that few minutes your heart stopped . '' \\n▁ ` ` but the fall alone could ' ve - '' ` ` she is well protected inside your immortal body . \\n▁ and she has an immortal body of her own . \\n▁ even if she did , in fact , die with you , she is clearly as xxunk as her mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` arthur actually thought she was dead . '' \\n▁ jase pointed his thumb at his uncle , half laughing . \\n▁ ` ` and with good reason , too , '' arthur defended . \\n▁ ` ` your abdomen was torn open on one side . \\n▁ upon closer inspection , i noticed that your uterus was enlarged . \\n▁ i was n't sure if it was a pregnancy or swelling , but i was bound by time , so i stitched you back up before anyone could notice , and left what i hoped was a child with a fighting chance . '' \\n▁ ` ` when i came in to see you after you woke , the old man let his thoughts slip for a second , '' jase said with a grin . \\n▁ ` ` he was trying to find a way to tell you the baby was dead . '' \\n▁ ` ` why 'd you think it was dead ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'd examined you after everyone left the room - confirmed you were pregnant , but … '' ` ` he still could n't hear a heartbeat , '' jase said . \\n▁ i looked at arthur . \\n▁ ` ` after jason 's initial shock about the child 's death , he looked at me as if i 'd gone insane and asked why i would tell you the child was dead , when he 'd just heard pulses coming from her tiny little brain . '' \\n▁ ` ` pulses ? '' \\n▁ i looked at jase . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ they 're the electrical signals all living things give - off . \\n▁ you should know , ara . \\n▁ you feel it when you walk in the forest , or - '' ` ` when i ' m in a room with a vampire . '' \\n▁ i nodded to myself . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , or a human . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you can sense them , too ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ jase ` ` it 's a talent we share . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` so , i knew she was still alive . \\n▁ we just … we ca n't hear her heart beat . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ ` ` something to do with your skin , we figure . \\n▁ it not only protects her from savagery , but conceals her , too . '' \\n▁ i laid a hand to my belly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m … how come i did n't sense her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` are you sure you did n't ? '' \\n▁ jase asked , his smile growing . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't felt anything - at all . \\n▁ aside from hungry . '' \\n▁ arthur and jason laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't believe i ' m pregnant . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's pretty good news , huh ? '' \\n▁ jase said . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but … '' the crease on my brow deepened as i looked at arthur . \\n▁ ` ` why did you make plans to use the turkey xxunk if you knew all along i was pregnant ? '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i never actually made plans , my dear . \\n▁ i put you off repeatedly , did n't i ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't ready to tell you about the child , amara , because - '' ` ` because it meant there was no way to save david . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ but now it seems we will lose him anyway . '' \\n▁ i looked at jase . \\n▁ his face was stone white and expressionless . \\n▁ ` ` jase , what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was so cut up when i realised you were pregnant - when … '' ` ` when he realized he 'd bedded you for no good reason other than his own primal needs . '' \\n▁ ` ` uncle , it was n't like that , '' jase said . \\n▁ arthur stood and moved away . \\n▁ ` ` so , i was pregnant when we … ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , ara . \\n▁ you know that if i 'd known that , i would never have - '' ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i stole his hand and kissed the knuckles . \\n▁ ` ` what 's done is done . \\n▁ and it 's in the past . \\n▁ none of it matters now . '' \\n▁ ` ` except that david is still hurt , '' arthur muttered . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ i sat up more . \\n▁ ` ` i messed up - bad . '' \\n▁ ` ` both of us did . '' \\n▁ jase smiled softly at me , squeezing my hand . \\n▁ ` ` but i can either move on from it , or wallow in it . \\n▁ and i have a baby to worry about now , so i ' m sorry , if david ca n't forgive and move on , too , even enough to be civil to me , then that 's his loss . \\n▁ not mine . '' \\n▁ arthur sat down on the couch across the room . \\n▁ ` ` then i pray he finds civility before he leaves . '' \\n▁ ` ` leaves ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ jase waited until i looked at him . \\n▁ ` ` arthur 's handing the dagger over to david tomorrow . \\n▁ he - '' ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ i threw my covers back and leaped out of bed . \\n▁ ` ` he ca n't . \\n▁ not yet . \\n▁ he has n't … i mean , does he even know ? '' \\n▁ i clutched my stomach . \\n▁ ` ` has anyone told him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he knows , '' said a dry , cool voice . \\n▁ i looked across the balcony to where the long - legged king leaned sideways against the railing , his arms folded . \\n▁ ` ` david , please tell me you 're not going to kill drake tomorrow . '' \\n▁ he looked at his uncle . \\n▁ ` ` give us a moment . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ arthur appeared across the room and opened the bedroom door . \\n▁ ` ` jason ? '' \\n▁ jase sighed , touching my arm as he passed . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be right outside if … '' he looked over at david . \\n▁ ` ` if you need me . '' \\n▁ i reached down and squeezed his hand . \\n▁ ` ` thanks . '' \\n▁ tension spread around the room then as the door grated in its frame , coming to a complete stop with me on one side , and my protector on the other . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not here to hurt you , '' david muttered angrily . \\n▁ ` ` i may hate you , ara , but i will not cause you physical harm . '' \\n▁ my shoulders relaxed . \\n▁ ` ` did you know ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` before today ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head , his cold stare staying on my face as i moved across the room and stepped out into the white sunlight . \\n▁ ` ` guess this explains why none of my jeans fit , '' i said , relieved . \\n▁ ` ` your jeans do n't fit because you 're fat , ara . \\n▁ do n't use pregnancy as an excuse . '' \\n▁ my lips fell apart a little . \\n▁ ` ` david , that 's - '' ` ` shut up . \\n▁ i did n't come here to debate your lack of self - worth . '' \\n▁ he turned away , leaning his elbows on the marble ledge , the world below his canvas for thought . \\n▁ ` ` then why did you come ? \\n▁ just to taunt me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i came to make something very clear to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , by all means , '' i said , standing beside him , knowing i was crossing the boundaries by getting this close . \\n▁ ` ` enlighten me . '' \\n▁ ` ` in exchange for the dagger , i promised my uncle i would stay for the birth of the child . '' \\n▁ i smiled , trying not to laugh with joy . \\n▁ david pretended not to notice . \\n▁ ` ` but that gives you no right to attempt contact with me . \\n▁ gives you no right to look at , talk to , or even address me as anything more personal than your king . \\n▁ do i make myself clear ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ that 's ridiculous , i ' m your - '' ` ` you are nothing to me ! '' \\n▁ he spun around , yelling in my face . \\n▁ ` ` well , i may not be , but she is your daughter . '' \\n▁ i touched my belly to emphasize her tiny little existence . \\n▁ he rolled his shoulders back , growing taller inch by inch , his bottom lip coming forward with detest . \\n▁ ` ` a fact i ' m forced to accept . \\n▁ and you are lucky she bares my blood - not my brother 's , or i 'd have ripped it from your womb . '' \\n▁ ` ` how dare you xxunk - '' ` ` easy . '' \\n▁ he moved closer . \\n▁ ` ` i care nothing for you , or for it . \\n▁ i am not your husband . \\n▁ i am not her father . \\n▁ i am a man forced by his word to stay and witness something he does not condone . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you do n't condone your own daughter . '' \\n▁ ` ` that - '' he pointed at my belly . \\n▁ ` ` is no daughter of mine . '' \\n▁ ` ` how can you say that ? \\n▁ she has your blood . \\n▁ we made her . \\n▁ she - '' ` ` she was spawned under false xxunk , ara , in a relationship i believed to be love . '' \\n▁ ` ` but it - '' ` ` it was nothing but a lie . '' \\n▁ he waved a hand through the air to shut me up . \\n▁ ` ` and she is as tainted as you . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 's innocent , david ! '' \\n▁ ` ` her body was growing in you when you betrayed me . '' \\n▁ his voice broke . \\n▁ ` ` i will never touch her . \\n▁ i will never touch you . \\n▁ and i will certainly not accept her as my own . '' \\n▁ i did n't realize i was crying until my chest shook and a cold tear dropped down , landing on my bare foot . \\n▁ david looked into me with nothing but hatred in his eyes - not one shred of compassion shining through . \\n▁ ` ` why would arthur make you stay then ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` if you hate us so much . '' \\n▁ ` ` because my uncle is hoping that by forcing me to wait for the dagger , i may find it in my heart to forgive you , '' he said stiffly , looking down his nose at this sobbing mess . \\n▁ ` ` but he 's a fool . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` for what ? '' \\n▁ he spat . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry he forced those terms on you . \\n▁ that 's … '' i shuddered . \\n▁ ` ` that 's really cruel . '' \\n▁ he cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , anyway - for stopping by , '' i said , going blank - faced after . \\n▁ i was n't really sure why i said that . \\n▁ ` ` you can see yourself out , i ' m sure ? '' \\n▁ he bowed his head once and walked away . \\n▁ ` ` oh , and … david ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` please tell arthur and jason i ' m sleeping now . '' \\n▁ i folded over a little , standing tall again quickly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m tired . '' \\n▁ his answering response was a door closed and a wordless , sad nothingness left in his wake . \\n▁ i looked out at the field in the distance , seeing the tip of the lighthouse , thinking back to the first time i saw this place . \\n▁ nothing about the landscape had changed , yet everything within it was upside - down and no longer fit the way it should . \\n▁ his anger at me went beyond hatred and worse , because of my crimes , he would not only hate me for the rest of forever , but he 'd hate our little girl too . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry , little baby . '' \\n▁ i touched my belly , sending my words and all the love i had in my heart through to her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ the day went so slowly , with me stuck on bed rest , that i read every book in my room before lunch , and found myself trolling the library shelves for more i could read up on about my people and the laws of our society . \\n▁ but a pair of arms suddenly wrapped my neck , stopping me dead in my tracks , emily 's shrill voice echoing my name in my own ears . \\n▁ ` ` congratulations , '' she trilled . \\n▁ ` ` thank you . '' \\n▁ i stepped back , rearranging the pile of books in my arms . \\n▁ ` ` are you excited ? '' \\n▁ she asked , patting my belly . \\n▁ ` ` you must be so excited . \\n▁ what did david say ? \\n▁ oh , my god , was he totally excited , too ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he , uh - '' i started , but what was i supposed to tell her ? \\n▁ to tell everyone ? \\n▁ that he disowned both our child and me ? \\n▁ ` ` he just said that nothing had changed between he and i. '' ` ` well , i had n't expected that much . '' \\n▁ an eager smile replaced that frown . \\n▁ ` ` but i bet he 's thrilled to finally have his own little baby . '' \\n▁ i moved my mouth into an awkward attempt at a neutral smile . \\n▁ ` ` well , at least you got the baby before all the … '' she patted my arm . \\n▁ ` ` you know ? '' \\n▁ i looked down at her hand . \\n▁ why had everyone suddenly started doing that to me ? \\n▁ every second person i passed that knew the truth about david and i patted my arm . \\n▁ it was the worst form of pity one could offer . \\n▁ ` ` i have to go , '' i said coldly and walked past her , hugging my new study materials . \\n▁ ` ` well , enjoy your books , '' she called casually . \\n▁ ` ` and do n't forget they 're announcing the ball today . '' \\n▁ i stopped again . \\n▁ ` ` ball ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ did n't david tell you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` the house are holding a ball in honour of our new princess . '' \\n▁ she presented my midsection . \\n▁ ` ` they 're making the formal announcement at court today . '' \\n▁ ` ` great . '' \\n▁ i rubbed my temple . \\n▁ ` ` what did david say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was n't there when they discussed it . '' \\n▁ ` ` and why was n't i ? '' \\n▁ ` ` duh , '' she said , shaking her head . \\n▁ ` ` you were unconscious . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , arthur told everyone else i was pregnant before he told me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ he told david first , and david told the house . \\n▁ i did n't even find out until after nate did . \\n▁ he told me . '' \\n▁ i settled back on my heels , noticing i was leaning toward emily a bit much , as if i were about to attack her . \\n▁ ` ` they 'll expect us to dance . '' \\n▁ ` ` who ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david and i . \\n▁ our people will expect us to dance at the ball . '' \\n▁ ` ` so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so … he 'll probably ` accidentally ' squeeze me too tight and pop my lung . '' \\n▁ ` ` and he 'll get one to match , '' blade said , forgetting for a second that guards are supposed to guard , not join the conversation . \\n▁ i narrowed my eyes at him , then turned back to em . \\n▁ ` ` you could always ask jason to be your date , '' she suggested . \\n▁ ` ` and how will i explain that to my people ? '' \\n▁ ` ` tell them you 're courting - that there may be an intent to marry . \\n▁ it does n't have to be true , '' she added , as i was about to freak . \\n▁ ` ` but at least you could dance the night with someone you trust , and no one would turn their head . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i spun on my heel and started walking again . \\n▁ ` ` the less i see of jason , the better . '' \\n▁ ` ` i thought you - '' em started , but blade shushed her sweetly with a finger to his lip as he passed , following me up the stairs . \\n▁ my door swung open , no one having knocked first , and a group of people entered without invitation . \\n▁ i lowered my book into my lap and watched three giant , gold - rimmed mirrors wander over to my sitting room , followed by a flow of portly women with folds of fabric over their arms , lead by an older woman , whose slim glasses and tape - measure - scarf gave her away as the seamstress who fitted my coronation dress . \\n▁ ` ` mrs xxunk , '' i said , standing up to be polite . \\n▁ ` ` nice to see you again . '' \\n▁ ` ` the pleasure is all mine , dear . '' \\n▁ she pushed her glasses up her nose , appraising me . \\n▁ ` ` the announcement for the ball has just been sent to the lilithian times for tomorrow 's print run , and i thought i 'd get a head - start on your fitting . \\n▁ falcon let me in . '' \\n▁ she turned and motioned to my guard standing guiltily in the doorway . \\n▁ he showed both palms and backed away . \\n▁ something told me he was n't given much choice but to let the old woman in . \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` well , you 're welcome any time , mrs xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` magda , please , '' she reminded me . \\n▁ ` ` of course . \\n▁ magda . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` now , if you 'll just set your pretty little self over there on those boxes , we 'll get these measurements done and then we can talk fabrics . '' \\n▁ she cupped both hands together , turning to the mirrored pedestal area they 'd set up just by the windows , and stood waiting . \\n▁ i sighed and wandered over , stepping up onto the pink velvet box wedged between the three mirrors , holding my arms out as if i were an airplane . \\n▁ a tape measure wrapped my waist first , magda making a face then that i saw too clearly in the reflection . \\n▁ ` ` my , you have put on a few centimetres , have n't you ? '' \\n▁ i swallowed , studying my fuller figure . \\n▁ now that i could see myself from three different angles , i finally saw what david meant . \\n▁ my butt and thighs were at least one size bigger . \\n▁ but it did n't look terrible . \\n▁ i looked … ` ` you look so healthy , '' magda said , stepping back a bit . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve got that lovely pregnancy glow , and your xxunk seventeen - year - old body has finally taken on the shape of a woman . '' \\n▁ ` ` you think ? '' \\n▁ i ran my hand down my hip . \\n▁ ` ` my darling little girl , this is you all grown up . '' \\n▁ she offered the scene before me . \\n▁ i took a good , long look at myself in the mirror , and in the kind tone of the way she presented me , i actually saw the beauty in my reflection . \\n▁ ` ` do you think i 'll stay like this even after i have the baby ? '' \\n▁ ` ` one could not be sure , sweet . \\n▁ does it really matter to you ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i kinda like having curves . '' \\n▁ magda laughed . \\n▁ ` ` try eating a bit more then , and those curves will stay on your hips as long as you want . \\n▁ now - '' she lifted my arm and laid the tape measure to my rib . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get this done . '' \\n▁ i twisted and turned and jerked about as she measured every inch of me , keeping my eye on the length of the shadows outside . \\n▁ it was getting dark , and i had n't had time to discuss a very important matter with jase yet . \\n▁ if this took much longer , it 'd be dinnertime before we knew it , and then i 'd have to wait until tomorrow . \\n▁ but time was running out . \\n▁ david was meeting arthur in the morning to get that dagger . \\n▁ and yeah , he promised to wait until the baby was born before he used it , but i did n't trust him . \\n▁ not one bit . \\n▁ ` ` lift your top up there for me , lovey . \\n▁ just want to get a proper measurement of that belly . '' \\n▁ i slowly drew my shirt up to my ribs , noticing a slight chill in the air as it touched my bare skin . \\n▁ ` ` now do n't go sucking yer gut in , girl . '' \\n▁ she slapped my bottom softly . \\n▁ ` ` it wo n't help your dress fit any better on the day . '' \\n▁ i let my stomach out to its natural position , and both magda and i drew a quick breath . \\n▁ i had n't seen my belly when i was standing up like this , uncovered by baggy shirts , and it seemed to disappear if i laid flat or sat down , like it almost tucked itself in . \\n▁ so , seeing the almost bowl - like bulge coming from just between my hipbones was a little of a shock - for both of us . \\n▁ ` ` there it is , '' she said kindly . \\n▁ ` ` you must n't try to hide it so much , amara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i just … i only just found out i was pregnant . \\n▁ i thought i was just fat . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , you 're not . \\n▁ you 're perfect . '' \\n▁ ` ` you think so ? '' \\n▁ i asked , running both hands down my belly . \\n▁ ` ` i prefer a time when women stayed hidden until they birthed , '' david said . \\n▁ magda and i turned quickly to where he stood in the now open doorway . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing in ` ere ? '' \\n▁ magda said , waving him off like a fly . \\n▁ ` ` no men allowed . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m the king . \\n▁ i can go where i please . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , make yer business known and be off with ya , lad ; i ' ve a xxunk ' to finish and a dress to make in just three days , '' she tittered , and lifted my top again , tossing the measuring tape around my waist . \\n▁ i tensed , wishing i could pull my shirt down or suck my gut in again . \\n▁ ` ` did you need something , david ? '' \\n▁ when he did n't answer , i dared to look at him through the reflection , but his eyes were on my belly , his lip lifted in disgust . \\n▁ ` ` pregnancy really is quite offensive . \\n▁ i fail to see the beauty in a heinous protrusion sticking out from one 's abdomen . '' \\n▁ ` ` your majesty ! '' \\n▁ magda gasped . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll break the poor girl 's heart . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , i would n't worry , seamstress . \\n▁ ara does n't have a heart to break . \\n▁ look at her - '' he angled his head toward me . \\n▁ ` ` nothing i say ever matters to her . '' \\n▁ magda looked up at me , shaking her head . \\n▁ ` ` okay , so i ' m fat and disgusting . '' \\n▁ i tried to sound pragmatic , but i just sounded kind of angry . \\n▁ ` ` what else did you come here to say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i need a swatch . '' \\n▁ ` ` for mr granger ? '' \\n▁ magda asked , jotting numbers down on her page . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' david said . \\n▁ ` ` well , i ' ve not talked fabrics , yet , so mr granger will need to meet with me later to coordinate the outfits . '' \\n▁ ` ` very well . '' \\n▁ david laid both hands behind his back and turned on his heel , leaving the door open after he left . \\n▁ ` ` never mind him , lovey . '' \\n▁ magda lowered my top for me . \\n▁ ` ` men are like pet dogs ; once you get pregnant , they ` ave to play up a little to make sure they 're not left out . '' \\n▁ i laughed , wiping a small , cool tear from my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` let 's have none of that . \\n▁ this is happy times . '' \\n▁ she patted my hip , bending to measure my leg again . \\n▁ ` ` now , we ' ve got these measurements all sorted . \\n▁ time to talk fabric . '' \\n▁ i smiled , just wishing this was over so i could go down to the training hall and toy around with my powers for a while . \\n▁ that chat with jason would have to wait until tomorrow . \\n▁ right now , all i wanted to do was bust up a few boulders - and maybe any unsuspecting vampires that happened to pass . \\n▁ chapter thirteen for a vampire , he was n't really all that alert . \\n▁ i half expected that , as soon as i pushed the creaky secret door open and then closed it , he 'd jump up and put a blade to my throat , dropping it in shock when he realized who was in his room at this hour . \\n▁ but he just laid there , sleeping peacefully , breathing deeply like all his worries had been blown away in the wind . \\n▁ and i knew it was my recent confession of love that had eased his soul so much . \\n▁ a big part of me wished then , in seeing him this way , that i could forget david and just love jason . \\n▁ it hurt him every time i tried to hold on to david , i knew that , but david had my heart first . \\n▁ i guess i just needed to be sure all hope for us was gone before i could give my heart away again . \\n▁ jase understood that . \\n▁ he was good like that . \\n▁ i wandered over and climbed up on his bed , a huge smile sweeping my lips for how cute and kind of sweet he looked when he was sleeping . \\n▁ ` ` jase , '' i whispered , poking him softly in the arm . \\n▁ ` ` jase . '' \\n▁ he groaned and rolled over a little , snapping awake when his eyes met mine . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` mornin ' , sunshine . '' \\n▁ the sheet slipped down his bare chest a bit as he pushed up on his elbow . \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on ? \\n▁ are you okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yep . '' \\n▁ i sat back on my knees . \\n▁ ` ` i had an idea . '' \\n▁ he rubbed his head , glancing off at his bedside clock . \\n▁ ` ` an idea at five in the morning ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and it 's brilliant . '' \\n▁ i slapped the covers . \\n▁ ` ` get up . \\n▁ get dressed . '' \\n▁ ` ` wait . '' \\n▁ he grabbed my arm before i could climb off the bed . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the answer 's been right in front of me the whole time . '' \\n▁ ` ` it has ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ if you face a battle with swords but hold only a stick , sneak away in the middle of the night and even the odds . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that something arthur said to you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , ages ago , but i got to thinking . \\n▁ we ' ve been trying to find a way to save david - trying to stop him from using that dagger . \\n▁ well - '' i leaned forward ever so slightly , grinning like a little kid . \\n▁ ` ` if there is no dagger , he ca n't use it . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ he rubbed his face again , his eyes heavy , half closed . \\n▁ ` ` if we ca n't kill drake , he comes in here in a few months and steals our baby - '' he presented my stomach . \\n▁ ` ` our baby ? '' \\n▁ i raised a brow at him , folding my arms slowly . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he sat up more , reaching across to sweep his hand along my waist , cupping the other one right over my belly . \\n▁ ` ` our baby . \\n▁ i might not ' ve put her in there , ara , but i love you , and i love anything inside you , and since i see no one else around here making a claim to her , i ' m officially putting mine forward . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase . '' \\n▁ i placed my hand over his . \\n▁ ` ` do n't do this to yourself . \\n▁ my greater plan here is - '' ` ` to give david no way out in the hopes he 'll one day forgive you and come back to you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm - hm . '' \\n▁ he laughed and sat back , dropping his forearm over his brow . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ i 'll help you . \\n▁ but i do n't think your plan 'll work . '' \\n▁ ` ` which part ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think he 'll ever love you again , ara , even if he has to stick around forever , '' he said softly . \\n▁ ` ` are you prepared for that ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and what about drake ? \\n▁ he will come for the baby . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m … '' i hesitated . \\n▁ i knew i could trust jason , but even he would go to great lengths to protect me , which could include hindering my plan . \\n▁ ` ` you arranged a meeting with drake , '' he said with a nod . \\n▁ ` ` damn it ! \\n▁ stop reading my mind . '' \\n▁ i slapped his arm . \\n▁ ` ` stop being so transparent . '' \\n▁ he playfully slapped mine back . \\n▁ a wave of silence rolled over the bed then . \\n▁ i sat back on the pillows beside jase and stared forward . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't stop you , ara , if this is what you want . '' \\n▁ ` ` you wo n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he scooped my hand up in his . \\n▁ ` ` i know drake wo n't hurt you while you 're carrying the child he 's waited centuries for . \\n▁ but if you plan to talk with him , at least do it on manor grounds - where we can protect you if he tries to kidnap you , or something . '' \\n▁ ` ` already the plan . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ i squeezed his hand . \\n▁ ` ` hey … thanks , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` for what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for letting me do this . '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't need to thank me . \\n▁ i ' m not letting you do this , ara . \\n▁ i do n't control you . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you do give your blessing . '' \\n▁ he exhaled , patting my hand . \\n▁ ` ` i think we should ' ve negotiated with drake from the start . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , see ? '' \\n▁ i presented jase in all his shirtless glory . \\n▁ ` ` this is why i want you on my council . '' \\n▁ he smiled . \\n▁ ` ` when the world spins on its axis and mike and falcon see i ' m not the enemy , then we can talk about that . \\n▁ but , right now , we need to discuss what you 'll do if you do n't like drake 's terms of agreement . '' \\n▁ ` ` already got that figured out , '' i said chirpily . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he folded his fingers together in his lap , leaning slightly sideways . \\n▁ ` ` then reveal to me your diabolical plot . '' \\n▁ ` ` if he refuses to negotiate within what i consider reasonable terms , my expert team of military operations specialists will find a way to lure him into a trap and imprison him for eternity . \\n▁ then , once you and i have researched my powers a bit more , we 'll come up with a way to kill him - without taking someone else 's life in the process . '' \\n▁ ` ` hm . '' \\n▁ he pressed his lips into a thin line . \\n▁ ` ` guess you have thought of everything . \\n▁ but - '' ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ he sat taller , lifting the blanket so he could shuffle closer . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to take xxunk with you when you meet drake . \\n▁ it might not kill him , but if you use your light through the blade , it 'll stun him long enough for you to escape . '' \\n▁ i nodded , trying to remember where i put that sword . \\n▁ ` ` it 's under your bed , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ that 's right . \\n▁ thanks . '' \\n▁ ` ` any time . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` now , when do you want to steal the dagger of xxunk ? '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ ` ` right now . '' \\n▁ we snuck back up the secret passage to my room and stood by the door , peeking out to where quaid sat - guarding me while i apparently slept . \\n▁ ` ` what 's he doing ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` playing on his phone . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's the plan ? '' \\n▁ he shut the door a little . \\n▁ ` ` i can put him to sleep , but if anyone happens by , they 'll raise an alarm . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ we 'll just have to be quick . '' \\n▁ ` ` all right , but … do you even know where the dagger is now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ david had it before he went to elysium , but he gave it back as a show of his love for me . '' \\n▁ i kind of laughed at how long ago all that felt now . \\n▁ ` ` but that was the fake , anyway . \\n▁ arthur never gave him the real dagger . '' \\n▁ jase frowned . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a fake ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` well , how will we know which one 's which ? '' \\n▁ ` ` easy . '' \\n▁ i smirked . \\n▁ ` ` we take them both . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , where 's the real dagger ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's … the hard part . '' \\n▁ ` ` i see . '' \\n▁ he shut the door completely , glaring down at me , unamused . \\n▁ ` ` you want me to put my uncle , whom i love and respect , into a deep sleep , then you want me to sneak into his mind and find the daggers ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , half shrugging as though it was no big deal . \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ he nodded and opened the door again . \\n▁ ` ` the things i 'll do for a girl . '' \\n▁ i laughed , but it was bit too loud . \\n▁ ` ` shh . '' \\n▁ jase shut the door again . \\n▁ ` ` he 's standing up . '' \\n▁ ` ` crap . \\n▁ do something . '' \\n▁ his smile moved slowly across his lips . \\n▁ ` ` done . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 'd you do ? '' \\n▁ i pushed past him and looked out into the hall : everyone was sleeping - quaid and the five otherwise usually invisible guards lining the halls . \\n▁ but lying on the floor like that , half of them snoring , all of them sprawled out , they were very noticeable indeed . \\n▁ i turned back and grinned at jase . \\n▁ ` ` you are so cool . '' \\n▁ he brushed his collar . \\n▁ ` ` all in a day 's work . '' \\n▁ ` ` now , come on . '' \\n▁ i grabbed his hand and dragged him from the room . \\n▁ ` ` we need to hurry . '' \\n▁ ` ` more for quaid 's sake than our own . \\n▁ if falcon sees him , ara - '' he motioned behind us to the lump of a guard on the ground . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i stopped right outside arthur 's door , momentarily reconsidering this . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't wan na get anyone in trouble . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , there 's no sense in turning back now , sweet girl . \\n▁ let 's just get it over with . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . '' \\n▁ i reached out to touch arthur 's door handle , but stopped . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not an early riser is he ? '' \\n▁ jase laughed breathily . \\n▁ ` ` most days , yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` great , '' i said nervously . \\n▁ ` ` well , i 'll turn the handle , and you put him out as soon as the door 's open . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ one … two … '' ` ` three . '' \\n▁ i pushed the door open and readied myself for arthur to look up and ask what we were doing , but he was sound asleep in his bed , just a pile of blankets and pillows : snoring blankets and pillows . \\n▁ i shut the door behind jase and i. ` ` he snores ? '' \\n▁ jase just laughed . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow . \\n▁ who 'd have thought ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nah , wait for it . '' \\n▁ he grabbed my wrist and stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` just wait … about … two seconds . '' \\n▁ i waited and , there it was : a deep , thundering roll of a sound like a handful of pebbles had been thrown down the back of arthur 's throat . \\n▁ it peaked to a high whistle , his breath stopping for a second . \\n▁ and i held my own , pausing until his started again , hissing out of him like the deep groan of an angry cat . \\n▁ jase and i burst out laughing . \\n▁ i covered my nose with the back of my wrist so i would n't snot all over the place . \\n▁ ` ` i have got to stop laughing through my nose . '' \\n▁ ` ` want a wipe ? '' \\n▁ he offered his sleeve . \\n▁ i bumped it away . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine . \\n▁ let 's just find this dagger . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ jase turned all business . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll get inside arthur 's head while you get the fake . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ i nodded and tiptoed off to arthur 's dresser drawer , slowly and quietly pulling it open while jason positioned himself on the bed , placing both hands to his uncle 's head . \\n▁ the dagger was there , in its box , just where arthur had left it - open to any who might want to get their hands on it . \\n▁ i was certain it was the fake . \\n▁ ` ` how 's the hunt going ? '' \\n▁ i asked , stuffing the box under my shirt . \\n▁ ` ` i - '' he squinted . \\n▁ ` ` just gim me a sec . '' \\n▁ i huffed a little impatiently , looking around the room . \\n▁ the sun was peeking over the hills outside , bringing the dawn and all that came with it . \\n▁ the guard would change over soon , and if we had n't finished our mission and climbed back into bed by then , someone would come along and find six men sleeping in the corridor . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ jase said , but he sounded kind of nervous . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve got it . '' \\n▁ ` ` got what ? '' \\n▁ he pulled his hands away from arthur 's head and looked at me , then at the lump under my shirt . \\n▁ ` ` that 's the real dagger . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not kidding . '' \\n▁ he appeared by arthur 's long oak table and waved me over . \\n▁ ` ` lay it out here . \\n▁ i wan na see it . '' \\n▁ i drew the box out from under my shirt and handed it to jason . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure it 's the real one ? '' \\n▁ ` ` as sure as the sun will rise , '' he said , thumbing the lid open . \\n▁ ` ` how can you tell ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because there is no fake . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're kidding ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nope . '' \\n▁ he grinned , closing the box again . \\n▁ i looked back at arthur . \\n▁ ` ` that cheeky devil . '' \\n▁ jase just nodded . \\n▁ ` ` he 's pretty clever . \\n▁ i did wonder how he had time to forge a fake . '' \\n▁ ` ` it would n't have surprised me either way . '' \\n▁ ` ` well - '' he tucked the box under his arm . \\n▁ ` ` best we get this somewhere safe . '' \\n▁ ` ` any ideas ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in plain sight . '' \\n▁ ` ` where in plain sight ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the weapons room . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` good idea . '' \\n▁ it was still dark down this end of the island , the sun hidden behind the tops of the trees , leaving the shelves , the rows of swords in stands , and the shields lined up around the space all shadowed and grey . \\n▁ the guard on duty had fallen asleep at his post before we even got here , so sneaking in had n't been tricky at all . \\n▁ knowing where to put the dagger , however , was n't as easy . \\n▁ ` ` so much heartache over such an ordinary blade , '' i said absently , running my fingers along the jewelled handle . \\n▁ jase reached down from the towering shelf he was climbing . \\n▁ ` ` pass it up . '' \\n▁ as i went to close the lid , though , a small corner of yellowing paper caught my eye . \\n▁ ` ` wait . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , i ' m hanging on with one finger right now . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , just … hang on for longer , '' i said playfully and put the box down again , ignoring jase 's sigh as i dug the frayed parchment out from under the velvet lining . \\n▁ ` ` what is it , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' i read it for a second . \\n▁ ` ` oh , it 's just the page describing how to use the dagger . '' \\n▁ ` ` wait . '' \\n▁ he showed a flat palm . \\n▁ ` ` do n't put it back in . \\n▁ i wan na see it . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i tucked the page into my jeans pocket and closed the box , tossing it all the way up to jase . \\n▁ he caught it awkwardly between his chest and the side of his forearm , then reached both hands up to the very top of the shelf , shifting and shoving things aside until he dropped back to the ground with a graceful bend of knees , dusting his hands off on his jeans . \\n▁ ` ` all done . '' \\n▁ ` ` great . \\n▁ and no one will know it 's up there ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not unless they take inventory . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ ` ` show me the page . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ um - '' i pulled it from my pocket and handed it to jase . \\n▁ he scanned the symbols slowly , his lips closing , eyes getting smaller and smaller . \\n▁ ` ` i need light . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ i whispered in a kind of loud voice . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? \\n▁ we need to get out of here . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't see properly , but - '' he laid the page on the table and waved his phone over it , lighting the up the small space around us . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't right . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's not ? '' \\n▁ ` ` this ink . \\n▁ it does n't match the date on the parchment . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ i spun the page around so i could see . \\n▁ ` ` look . '' \\n▁ he pointed to a weirdly shaped letter . \\n▁ ` ` to the average vampire , this is just an ordinary document , but to my expert eye , this symbol , which indicates the text was written at some point in the fifteen - hundreds , does n't match the age of the ink . \\n▁ this ink - '' he licked his thumb and rubbed the corner of the page a few times . \\n▁ ` ` it 's less than ten years old . '' \\n▁ ` ` how do you know that ? \\n▁ wait - '' i put both hands up . \\n▁ ` ` do n't tell me . \\n▁ i probably do n't want the lengthy explanation . '' \\n▁ he touched my arm softly . \\n▁ ` ` let 's just say it has a lot to do with pigment . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , what does that mean - if this document is a forgery ? '' \\n▁ he stood straight again slowly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you think maybe the dagger is n't what we think it is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` anything could be possible . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , would n't arthur have known the document was forged ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he laughed and folded the page up , handing it back to me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's just not his area of expertise . '' \\n▁ i smirked , catching the swagger in his tone . \\n▁ ` ` oh , big - noting yourself , huh ? '' \\n▁ ` ` big - noting ? '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , yeah , it means … like , to xxunk exaggerate your own worth . '' \\n▁ his lips turned down with thought . \\n▁ ` ` well , i am pretty darn clever . '' \\n▁ i wrapped my arm around his waist and we wandered out of the weapons room . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , even i have to admit that . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * quaid walked me all the way down to the secret garden , giving tips on how to swing my sword and position my feet , stating that i did n't really need to practice privately because i was a better ` swordsmen ' - his words - than any of the men in the core . \\n▁ and i knew that , but the ` private ' practice was merely a clever cover . \\n▁ i xxunk him , asking him to wait outside in case i ` cut ' myself , and pushed the heavy door to the garden of lilith open , holding my breath the whole time . \\n▁ the door closed with an eerie echo , sealing me in , and a dark figure showed itself , his familiar black cloak brushing the ground as he stood and cast his gaze upon me . \\n▁ i stopped to take him in : his short dark hair , set in thick , wavy locks around his face ; his pale skin , so youthful it was almost painful to look at , and then there was his eyes : the cobblestone path under me led the way in pale blues and creams to his feet , the grey bark of leafy green trees behind him creating a backdrop of nature 's pleasantries , all lit warmly by the golden rays of the midday sun , making the water in the fountain beside him sparkle - but none of it compared to the brilliant blue of his eyes , how they drew me into him without need for footsteps , leading us face to face , as if our eyes had locked but an inch away . \\n▁ ` ` amara , '' he said , bowing his head . \\n▁ i snapped back into myself then , noticing the sudden distance that lay between us . \\n▁ ` ` hello , drake . '' \\n▁ ` ` please - '' he turned and offered the small white garden table behind him . \\n▁ ` ` take a seat . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ i nodded to wake myself up , readjusting xxunk in her belt as i walked . \\n▁ brown boots over shadow over cobblestones , i took the two steps leading up to the garden and offered my uncle a smile . \\n▁ he smiled back , drawing a chair from under the table for me . \\n▁ ` ` you look lovely in yellow , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` just like my little sister . '' \\n▁ i sat down , turning my sword belt so xxunk aimed at the ground , not my knee . \\n▁ ` ` yellow 's my favourite colour . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that so ? '' \\n▁ he sat down , his brows moving up in surprise . \\n▁ ` ` it was lili 's too . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , we were related . '' \\n▁ i leaned an elbow on the table , removing it quickly so i did n't seem ill - mannered . \\n▁ ` ` yes , you were , were n't you ? '' \\n▁ he considered me for a second . \\n▁ ` ` and i must say that , of all her descendants , amara , you are by far the prettiest . \\n▁ i can only pray my child will be just like her mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` your child ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he said , motioning to my belly . \\n▁ ` ` we ' ve waited such a long time for this miracle . \\n▁ in fact , i brought a gift for her . '' \\n▁ i sat back a bit , preparing myself mentally as he reached into a small leather bag on the side of his belt . \\n▁ clearly he and i were in for a bit of an argument today since he 'd already claimed my baby as his own . \\n▁ ` ` this belonged to my beloved wife when she was alive . '' \\n▁ he laid something on the table , keeping his long , youthful fingers over it for a second . \\n▁ ` ` i thought you should have it . \\n▁ wear it while she grows inside you . '' \\n▁ ` ` whoa . \\n▁ hold on . '' \\n▁ i put my hand up and , at that moment , drake drew his away , revealing a giant oval , almost gaudy - looking emerald stone , set into a fine weave of golden chain . \\n▁ ` ` that 's beautiful , drake , but … did you just say your wife is - '' ` ` growing inside you , '' he stated factually , his eyes moving then to my belly as if he looked upon her for the first time in centuries - his beloved anandene . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i blocked his view , crossing two hands over my midsection . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get one thing straight here . \\n▁ this is not , nor will it ever be , that witch ! '' \\n▁ ` ` witch ! '' \\n▁ he shot up out of his chair and stood over me , darkening the sun with the mere presence of anger . \\n▁ ` ` you will do well to remember that i loved that witch , and have gone to great lengths to see her reborn , amara - rose . \\n▁ speak ill of her again and i will knock you unconscious . \\n▁ do i make myself clear ? '' \\n▁ i could only nod a few times , both arms wrapping my baby , sheltering her from the raw emotion emanating off that vampire . \\n▁ he sat back down , and the sun came out again , the birds in the trees making merry little songs around us once more , while the leaves on the trees danced in the wind . \\n▁ ` ` you have heard many stories about this contract , i am sure . \\n▁ but only one is true . '' \\n▁ ` ` and which one is that ? '' \\n▁ i asked spitefully , still sitting to attention . \\n▁ ` ` my sister lilith gave her soul to see anandene reborn , and i have waited many centuries for all the pieces to finally come together . \\n▁ you carry inside you the blood of my sister , mixed with oldest , most pure blood of nobles known to mankind , but she will bare the soul of my long - dead wife . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i looked around as if there was something i could say or do to weaken the meaning in his words . \\n▁ ` ` she ca n't . \\n▁ i wo n't let that xxunk - '' ` ` it already has . \\n▁ the moment she was conceived , you broke the curse you carried to bear only females , and you opened a portal for anandene 's soul to cross over - carried along the path all souls travel when a new child is conceived . '' \\n▁ ` ` so that 's just it ? \\n▁ she 's already anandene ? \\n▁ you do n't need to do a ritual or - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` there are many ways to xxunk a soul , but this is the only way that ensures permanent success . \\n▁ if i simply reinserted her into a body that shared the blood of her lineage , she could not have been immortal . \\n▁ she would still be a witch , but would not live forever . \\n▁ and it is that desire that got her killed in the first place . '' \\n▁ ` ` how so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she attempted a spell , using the stone - '' ` ` and lilith had to kill her to undo the curse she invoked ? '' \\n▁ i nodded when drake did . \\n▁ ` ` so , you what ? \\n▁ you devised this plan over centuries just so you could have forever together ? '' \\n▁ he smiled simply . \\n▁ ` ` you 're in love , are you not ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but - '' ` ` what lengths would you go to ? '' \\n▁ i leaned back , exhaling . \\n▁ ` ` and this is why the contract promises you the baby ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it promises the baby will be born , yes , and in exchange i will give back what i took . \\n▁ but it does not promise me possession of the child . \\n▁ she will come for me when her memories return . '' \\n▁ ` ` memories ? '' \\n▁ ` ` one day , everything she was in her past life will come back to her , and she will look for me . '' \\n▁ we both sat silently for a second . \\n▁ i pictured my daughter all grown up : long , dark hair , blue eyes - just like mine , just like drake 's - seeking him out and then … marrying him . \\n▁ ` ` that is so gross , drake ! \\n▁ you 're her uncle . '' \\n▁ ` ` separated by generations of genetic interference . '' \\n▁ ` ` it does n't matter . \\n▁ it 's disgusting , and you are so not ever getting anywhere near her . '' \\n▁ he closed his eyes slowly , breathing out long through his nose . \\n▁ ` ` my dear , sweet niece . \\n▁ i did not come here to argue or negotiate . \\n▁ you are bound by law to have this child , and she will one day know me . \\n▁ there is nothing you can do to stop this . '' \\n▁ ` ` i can take her away , far away , so she 'll - '' ` ` if you do that , you will be signing your own death warrant . '' \\n▁ i stopped mid - sentence and frowned at him . \\n▁ ` ` how so ? '' \\n▁ with an impatient groan , he drew something from his belt and laid it on the table beside the shimmering emerald . \\n▁ ` ` what is that ? '' \\n▁ it looked just like the dagger of xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` it 's the dagger you ' ve all been driving yourselves crazy over these last few months . '' \\n▁ ` ` but that 's - '' he knocked my hand away as i reached to grab it . \\n▁ ` ` in the weapons room . \\n▁ i know . \\n▁ well , at least … it was . '' \\n▁ ` ` how did you get that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , without the astonishing talents of jason knight , it would still be in arthur 's possession . '' \\n▁ he winked at me . \\n▁ ` ` you two practically gift - wrapped it for me . '' \\n▁ i silently cursed my own so - called brilliant plan . \\n▁ ` ` i have not been brave enough to attempt stealing it right from under arthur 's nose , and i must say , i too believed he had , in fact , forged an imitation , '' he said , sitting back , slowly drawing his hand away from the dagger and just leaving it right there on the table in front of me , with nothing to stop me jamming it through his heart . \\n▁ ` ` go ahead , '' he offered . \\n▁ ` ` pick it up . \\n▁ jam it through my heart . \\n▁ it wo n't kill me . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ i said through my teeth . \\n▁ ` ` because i fabricated a purpose for this dagger in the hopes that some vengeful vampire , one day , would return it to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` or try to kill you with it . '' \\n▁ ` ` precisely . \\n▁ at which point i 'd take it from them . '' \\n▁ ` ` not if they got it in your heart first . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you miss the part where i said i made up that entire story ? \\n▁ parchment and all . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the very notion that this dagger severs the connection of an immortal soul from this realm of life is ludicrous . \\n▁ it does nothing of the sort . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would you make up a story like that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because the dagger had been stolen by a woman i trusted . \\n▁ i needed it back , and the best way to acquire something valuable is by hand - delivery . \\n▁ unfortunately , i sent arthur to find it , knowing it was here somewhere , but - '' he sighed , looking down wistfully at the table , '' - it seems even my oldest and most trusted friend fell victim to the appeal of my death . '' \\n▁ ` ` so … '' i aimed my thumb at the dagger , its shimmering jewels looking suddenly dull as all hope faded from its blade . \\n▁ ` ` it wo n't kill you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not even when steered by the hand of a king . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` but it is very important to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` how so ? '' \\n▁ he picked it up , considering the handle . \\n▁ ` ` inside this hilt is a very vital piece of a puzzle - one that is key to xxunk the terms of the contract with my sister . \\n▁ once you give birth and the child is safe , i will uphold my end of the agreement . '' \\n▁ ` ` which is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to resurrect lilith . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i sat forward excitedly . \\n▁ ` ` you can bring her back ? '' \\n▁ he nodded once , laying the dagger down again . \\n▁ ` ` and the dagger is the key ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it is . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow . \\n▁ so , that 's what you agreed to restore in the contract : lilith ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it is . '' \\n▁ i sat back in my chair , shaking my head at the dagger . \\n▁ ` ` so much trouble was caused over that damn thing . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i heard you even went as far as to give yourself to the king 's brother . '' \\n▁ i made a weird , awkward kind of face . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i kinda did . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha - ha - ha ! '' \\n▁ he patted my hand . \\n▁ ` ` oh , lili , not much about you has changed after all these centuries . '' \\n▁ my tongue dried up a little , stuck on a word . \\n▁ ` ` did you just call me … lili ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he said , holding the same loving smile i 'd seen in the glass mural on my ceiling . \\n▁ ` ` that is your name or , at least … was . '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ gravity sunk my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't really understand . '' \\n▁ ` ` my little sister , bless her heart , gave up her soul to see anandene reborn . \\n▁ we needed a pure womb to grow the child - one not marred or tainted by any man before . \\n▁ but lili had had several children by this time , so we created a curse or , rather , a spell that would see her bear only females - soulless females , since our contract , and my anandene , was bound to lili 's soul . \\n▁ when the child was born , lilith 's soul was placed into the vessel and , sixteen years later , bred with noble blood to give rise to anandene . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , whoa , hang on . \\n▁ so , you had to wait sixteen years ? '' \\n▁ ` ` powerful spells take time . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , what happened ? \\n▁ if you had anandene back then … '' ` ` well , we were ignorant . \\n▁ we thought that a man of noble title would suffice . \\n▁ but gods do not care for the importance man places on himself . \\n▁ the child needed to be of true noble blood . \\n▁ so , another soulless child was born in place of what was supposed to be anandene , and we moved lilith 's soul to the new vessel . '' \\n▁ ` ` and then what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in the sixteen more years we had to wait , a close friend of mine devised a cleansing ritual - to see a male born of such pure and noble blood that none other would compare . '' \\n▁ ` ` what kind of … '' i swallowed , ` ` ritual ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was sent to trace bloodlines back to the days of christ - find one that had been noble of title and xxunk as far back as possible . \\n▁ xxunk would give a potion to the wife of this man , and his bloodline would , from that day forth , bare only sons that would bear only sons , and so on and so on , until two sons were born to one mother . \\n▁ one , the purest and noblest child man had ever known , and the other - '' ` ` all the bad things in one little boy . '' \\n▁ i nodded , sitting back in my chair , my eyes glazed and lost on the day . \\n▁ ` ` so this noble knight , it was - '' ` ` arthur 's bloodline . \\n▁ but , since he never fathered a child , i was forced to use his brother 's descendants . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's why you let him watch over them all these years ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i let him protect and keep them safe because it was a promise he made to his dying brother . \\n▁ however , that fact did work to my advantage . '' \\n▁ ` ` does … does arthur know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve suspected for some time . \\n▁ but i ' m not sure he knows the full story . \\n▁ he knows enough to draw conclusions - enough to have told david 's mother she would bring an evil child into the world , but - '' ` ` so arthur started that story ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and i know he feels great regret for that . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because , when thomas knight learned of it , he cast the demon child out , treated him poorly , as if the boy would bring hell rising to the earth . '' \\n▁ ` ` wo n't he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ drake laughed . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not evil . \\n▁ just impure - everything undesirable filtered out of mankind . \\n▁ seven deadly sins , you might say : greed , lust , all that stuff . \\n▁ but even creatures such as this are given the gift of free will . \\n▁ and i believe jason has chosen the path of light and good , has he not ? '' \\n▁ i smiled , thinking about him . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ he has . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you 're proud of him ? '' \\n▁ he asked , but it was more of a statement . \\n▁ ` ` i am . '' \\n▁ ` ` then , let me ask you something . '' \\n▁ he waited until i looked at him . \\n▁ ` ` how would you feel to know that your actions cost him his life ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i mean , if you , say … chose to steal my child away , i could n't vouch for the safety and freedom of your people , amara . \\n▁ how would it feel to know that , just to keep this child from coming to me , you 'd sacrificed all those lives - including your beloved jason ? '' \\n▁ ` ` are you threatening me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` merely outlining the options . '' \\n▁ he picked up the dagger again and slipped it into its leather strap . \\n▁ ` ` you can not save yourself , but you can secure the freedom and eternal safety of your people - friends and family included . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean by i can not save myself ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , you did n't catch on ? '' \\n▁ he asked , scooping up anandene 's emerald . \\n▁ ` ` you 're the re - manifestation of my sister 's soul - inserted into one baby after another until the knight twins were born . \\n▁ god knows , we had no way of knowing it would take centuries , but all 's well that ends well . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't see what that has to do with my death . '' \\n▁ ` ` the contract , my dear . \\n▁ when the child is born , i am bound by my word to resurrect lilith . \\n▁ her body will be pieced back together , and her soul - '' ` ` will leave my body . '' \\n▁ i went numb right through , sitting back so slowly i almost could n't feel the back of the chair . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll die ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ but you have … '' he considered my belly , '' - seven months to get your affairs in order . \\n▁ no pun intended . '' \\n▁ he laughed . \\n▁ i looked up at him . \\n▁ ` ` but that is n't fair . '' \\n▁ he stopped laughing . \\n▁ ` ` do not get me started on fair , my dear . \\n▁ how fair is that every time i ' ve come close to achieving my goal , something or someone has gotten in my way ? \\n▁ i had to wait centuries for the pure knight to be born , not knowing when he would come , and on that day , the lilithian descendant was missing . \\n▁ you would have conceived her on your wedding night had my warriors not been so good at their job . \\n▁ you would never have even been born had my father not kidnapped the original child . '' \\n▁ he slammed his fist on the table . \\n▁ ` ` i searched for you for over thirty years , only for my warriors to find the infant , amara , and bring her to be killed . \\n▁ and i thought it would be over . \\n▁ david bonded with her , chose to leave her alive , and he goddamn well lost her before i could get her back . '' \\n▁ ` ` ha ! '' \\n▁ i sat back , smiling at nothing . \\n▁ ` ` sucked in . '' \\n▁ ` ` the next time i found her , '' he continued as if i had n't spoken , ` ` she was being born to a sixteen year old rose ! \\n▁ do not talk to me about unfair , because i have had more than my fair amount of unfair . '' \\n▁ ` ` so that 's why you made arthur turn the boys - '' ` ` turn david , yes . \\n▁ i cared not what he did with the other one . \\n▁ but i needed david immortal in case i found the bloodline of my sister a century later . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you found me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nineteen years ago , yes . \\n▁ but , this time , i chose not to let my father know i knew where you were - just watched from afar . \\n▁ and i saw to it that both you and david ended up in the same place at the same time . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's why you told david to go to school . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and had you agreed to spend the summer at your father 's that year , i would not have had to place you in his custody . \\n▁ but i was not going to let a moody , spoiled teenager get in the way of my success . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ he eyed me mockingly . \\n▁ ` ` did you really think your mother 's death was an accident ? '' \\n▁ i coughed out , folding over , hearing his explanation run through me but pass nowhere near my ears . \\n▁ ` ` you killed her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you might say i shifted the pieces on the board in my favour . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is n't a game , drake ! '' \\n▁ i got to my feet , shaking . \\n▁ ` ` these are peoples ' lives . '' \\n▁ ` ` and many have been lost ! '' \\n▁ he stood too . \\n▁ ` ` none more heartbreaking than my wife . \\n▁ i will kill thousands more , amara , '' he said , his teeth like a cage . \\n▁ ` ` thousands , to see her safe and in my arms again . \\n▁ do not test my resolve . '' \\n▁ i sat back down again , tears streaming my cheeks , pooling and dripping under my chin . \\n▁ ` ` what will happen to my baby if you take me away from her when she 's born ? '' \\n▁ drake sat slowly . \\n▁ ` ` she will be raised by her father , who will know nothing of what i ' ve told you here today . '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked onto his . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve gone to great lengths to protect this one truth all these centuries , amara , twisting and reshaping the stories until no one remembered anything about a contract . \\n▁ if anyone were to find out , they would use anandene against me - possibly kill her . '' \\n▁ i gasped . \\n▁ ` ` it serves you well not to tell a soul , because you will be putting your own daughter in great danger . '' \\n▁ i looked down at my hands on my belly , drawing my top up just a little to see the way the sunlight made my hands so golden against my pale white stomach . \\n▁ ` ` she needs a mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` she will have lilith in her life . '' \\n▁ ` ` but that 's not her mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what would you have me do ? \\n▁ break the agreement i made with my sister ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't do that , '' he started . \\n▁ ` ` then do n't break it . \\n▁ just … '' i thought hard , trying to find some medium ground . \\n▁ ` ` give me time . \\n▁ give lilith back her soul , but let me keep it - just until the child is old enough to cope without a mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` how old ? '' \\n▁ i looked down at the belly again . \\n▁ ` ` eighteen . \\n▁ maybe . '' \\n▁ ` ` eighteen ? '' \\n▁ he nearly leaped out of his seat . \\n▁ ` ` you want me to delay my promise to my sister for eighteen years ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's in the child 's best interests , drake . \\n▁ she ca n't grow up without a mother . \\n▁ she 'll never feel complete . '' \\n▁ ` ` she has a mother . \\n▁ xxunk is her mother . '' \\n▁ my head rolled forward , my jaw nearly touching my chest . \\n▁ ` ` the witch is anandene 's mother ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why do you think she 's helped me all these years ? '' \\n▁ i wanted to throw my hands up and shake my head . \\n▁ nothing surprised me anymore . \\n▁ ` ` well , the baby wo n't know that until she gets her memories back . \\n▁ she needs her birth mother until then . '' \\n▁ ` ` very well , '' he said with a nod . \\n▁ ` ` i will give you eighteen years with the child , but you must let me see her in that time . \\n▁ she must know me . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ but , once i ' m gone , david stays on the throne , and everyone i love remains free and unharmed . '' \\n▁ he laid a hand to his heart . \\n▁ ` ` i give you my word . '' \\n▁ ` ` including arthur . '' \\n▁ his smile changed . \\n▁ ` ` i will not promise him immunity . \\n▁ he betrayed me , amara , he must pay . '' \\n▁ ` ` then the deal 's off . '' \\n▁ i folded my arms and sat back . \\n▁ ` ` very well . '' \\n▁ he stood . \\n▁ ` ` send word when the child is born and , the next time we meet , you will be my sister once more . '' \\n▁ he bowed and turned on his heel , walking away . \\n▁ just leaving it at that . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ wait . '' \\n▁ i jumped up and ran after him , grabbing the edge of his cloak . \\n▁ ` ` just … what do you want with arthur ? \\n▁ you wo n't hurt him , will you ? '' \\n▁ he smiled and cupped my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` sweet niece , you must never ask me such things - for your own good . \\n▁ i do not wish to upset you and , in turn , upset the baby . \\n▁ i will come for arthur soon , and you can either take our previous agreement , or you can die the day your child is born . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i stepped back , nodding . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll take the agreement . '' \\n▁ ` ` a wise choice . '' \\n▁ he leaned over and kissed my brow . \\n▁ ` ` take care , amara . \\n▁ you will hear from me soon . '' \\n▁ ` ` drake ? '' \\n▁ i called . \\n▁ he stopped and turned to face me . \\n▁ ` ` can i ask you something else ? '' \\n▁ ` ` anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` where 's xxunk ? \\n▁ you said he stole the child , endlessly ruined your plans . \\n▁ how do we know he wo n't try to kill the baby now i ' m carrying it ? '' \\n▁ he moved toward me again , graceful as water over sand , and slid his knuckles softly down my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` because he loves you . \\n▁ he would never do anything to hurt you . '' \\n▁ ` ` he loves me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he does . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , who is he ? \\n▁ i mean , do i know him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he will reveal himself in time . '' \\n▁ he turned away . \\n▁ ` ` but do not fear for the child , unless you share anything we ' ve talked about here today . '' \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't . \\n▁ but … can i at least tell david he does n't have to die ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . \\n▁ providing you leave out as much detail as possible , '' he said without turning around , and the wind brushed softly across my cheeks then , blowing dust into my eyes . \\n▁ i rubbed them , blinking rapidly , but when i opened them again , drake was gone and the buzz of life in the garden had come out of hiding . \\n▁ i stood for a while , listening to it all and , despite knowing my life would end in eighteen years , i felt strangely happy and , for the first time since i met david … safe . \\n▁ but i just could n't believe david and jason were a plan all along - the result of a spell - two lives i was never intended to be a part of . \\n▁ drake said it was unfair and that luck had not befallen him , but it had for me . \\n▁ i was lucky to have been born , and so lucky to have been the one to love david , even if it had all fallen apart . \\n▁ i had a lot to think about right now , yet i shoved it all down and let the single moment of joy that david did n't have to die consume me , running for the door . \\n▁ pretty much none of what drake said was good news , but that one bit was enough to stop me falling to the ground and crying my eyes out right now . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` falcon . '' \\n▁ i marched toward him quickly , checking the manor entranceway for other ears . \\n▁ ` ` call a meeting . '' \\n▁ ` ` meeting ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , with the private council , but - '' i grabbed his arm , '' - do n't let morgaine know . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i checked over my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` she 's fired . '' \\n▁ his eyes went wide . \\n▁ ` ` is this because of - '' ` ` it 's because i do n't trust her anymore , falcon . \\n▁ and i do n't have to give a reason . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ he bowed his head . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll organise the meeting for twenty minutes ' time , yeah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` great . \\n▁ thanks . '' \\n▁ falcon disappeared beyond the archway to the east of the manor , and i stood in the middle of the entranceway with my eyes closed , searching for that feeling - the little buzz i always got around jason . \\n▁ and when it tingled deep within me , i sent a thought out . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ the energy changed . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? \\n▁ meet me in the - '' ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ he grabbed my arm gently , snapping me aware . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i need you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what for ? \\n▁ and how did you know how to reach me like that ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i can always feel you , so … i just searched for that feeling - aimed my thoughts in that direction . '' \\n▁ he smiled , his eyes wide with wonder . \\n▁ ` ` you are amazing . \\n▁ can you do that with anyone else ? '' \\n▁ ` ` feel them ? \\n▁ yeah . \\n▁ but not call to them . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow . \\n▁ tell me where … '' he looked around , '' - tell me where arthur is right now . '' \\n▁ i groaned . \\n▁ ` ` jase , i do n't have time for circus tricks . '' \\n▁ ` ` please . '' \\n▁ he sunk lower into his knees , closing his hands in prayer . \\n▁ ` ` come on . \\n▁ this is cool . '' \\n▁ i groaned again , rolling my eyes , and then closed them , picturing arthur , feeling him . \\n▁ ` ` he 's … in his room . '' \\n▁ ` ` that is amazing . '' \\n▁ ` ` it can be amazing later . '' \\n▁ i tugged his sleeve until his thoughtful gaze came back down to earth . \\n▁ ` ` right now , i want to offer you a job . '' \\n▁ ` ` job ? '' \\n▁ ` ` a position on my council just opened up . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ his tone rose , half with shock , the other half with joy . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just about to fire morgaine , and i need a new member that i trust implicitly . \\n▁ i could n't think of anyone else in the world . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , ara . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i … i ca n't , sweet girl . \\n▁ david will - '' ` ` i ' m dividing the councils , now , jase . \\n▁ david is no longer on this council . \\n▁ being king does n't give him right to advise me - never has . \\n▁ i gave him a position on my council because i trusted him . \\n▁ but , now , well , he can get his own council , and he has no say over who is on mine . '' \\n▁ ` ` what did he do to you ? '' \\n▁ he asked , his eyes shrinking . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ i ' m fine . \\n▁ but … if you 're on my council , he ca n't do anything to you . \\n▁ it gives you protection , gets you off stable duties , and … '' i grinned suggestively . \\n▁ ` ` i get a new room . '' \\n▁ he nodded , catching on . \\n▁ ` ` yup . \\n▁ you 'll be right next to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i bet that 'll piss david off . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not really sure i care right now , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's being cruel , is n't he ? '' \\n▁ he asked , sweeping my hair back behind my ear . \\n▁ i nodded , but before i even looked up , my face was against jason 's shirt , his arms around me tightly . \\n▁ ` ` you need to tell me , ara . \\n▁ every time he does or says anything that hurts you , you need to tell me . '' \\n▁ ` ` there 's no point , jase . \\n▁ i know he 's hurt and just doing anything he can to make me suffer . \\n▁ it 'll pass . '' \\n▁ he clicked his tongue . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not so sure about that , sweet girl . \\n▁ he 's - '' ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ falcon cut in , leaning around the wall . \\n▁ ` ` council 's in session . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , already ? '' \\n▁ i flipped jason 's hand over and looked at his watch . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll be there in two minutes . '' \\n▁ ` ` we ? '' \\n▁ falcon looked at jason . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i thrust my shoulders back . \\n▁ ` ` we . '' \\n▁ ` ` as in … ? '' \\n▁ he motioned between jason and i. ` ` yes . \\n▁ i just hired jason . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he groaned , standing off the wall . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll prepare the others . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i called , then smiled up at jase . \\n▁ ` ` ready ? '' \\n▁ he slipped his hand into mine . \\n▁ ` ` as long as i ' ve got you , i can face anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` amara ? '' \\n▁ arthur called from the top of the stairs , his voice sharp with a sense of urgency . \\n▁ jase and i stopped walking . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ ` ` where 's david ? \\n▁ ` ` i - '' i looked around . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the dagger . '' \\n▁ he appeared beside me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's gone . \\n▁ i ' m afraid he 's - '' ` ` it 's not gone . '' \\n▁ jason said , and we smiled at each other . \\n▁ ` ` drake took it , '' i cut in . \\n▁ they both looked at me in shock . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ since when ? '' \\n▁ jase said . \\n▁ ` ` that 's why i was calling the meeting . \\n▁ i wanted to inform my council first that i met with drake , and - '' ` ` when ? '' \\n▁ arthur asked . \\n▁ ` ` just now . \\n▁ he - '' ` ` amara , what were you thinking ? \\n▁ he - '' ` ` it 's all right , arthur . \\n▁ everything is fine , '' i assured him , patting his arm . \\n▁ ` ` and we have a plan . '' \\n▁ ` ` we ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake and i . \\n▁ we came to an agreement . '' \\n▁ jason closed his feet , making himself a little taller . \\n▁ ` ` and you 're happy with the terms ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` as much as i can be , yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` and he has the dagger ? '' \\n▁ arthur asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` amara , how will we - '' ` ` we ca n't kill him , arthur . \\n▁ that 's not what the dagger does . '' \\n▁ he stopped the protest short of his lips and just stood there frowning . \\n▁ ` ` what does it do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we need to talk . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you 'd better start at the beginning , '' david said from behind us . \\n▁ i groaned loudly , more annoyed than shocked that he was there , and slowly turned around . \\n▁ ` ` we need to call a house meeting . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` no , you need to tell me , right now , what you ' ve done . '' \\n▁ he walked coolly over and stood before me like a towering lighthouse with angry green lanterns for eyes . \\n▁ ` ` well , for one , you do n't have to die now . '' \\n▁ his mouth came open , his tongue moving to the inside of his cheek . \\n▁ ` ` where 's the dagger ? '' \\n▁ ` ` drake has it . '' \\n▁ david looked at arthur accusingly . \\n▁ ` ` you gave it to him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i would do no such thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` uncle , the lengths you ' ve gone to to keep it from me all this time , i would n't be surprised if you set that meeting up for her and drake . '' \\n▁ ` ` he did n't , okay ? '' \\n▁ i took a step closer , kind of moving between david and arthur . \\n▁ ` ` i called him on the phone and i arranged the meeting . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you know about this ? '' \\n▁ david looked at jason . \\n▁ ` ` i knew she 'd arranged it , but did n't know it was today . '' \\n▁ david stepped back and ran his hands through his hair . \\n▁ ` ` so what now ? \\n▁ you 're just gon na hand your child over to him and let him rule our people again ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` then what did you agree to , ara ? '' \\n▁ he reached out and grabbed both my arms ; it hurt a little but i was , in a really sick way , just happy he 'd touched me again . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't fight the contract , david . \\n▁ we never could . \\n▁ when he told me that the dagger has no use - '' i said , leaving off the bit about it resurrecting lilith , '' - i was given little choice but to agree to uphold the original deal . '' \\n▁ ` ` you did what ? '' \\n▁ david yelled . \\n▁ ` ` ara , how could you be so stupid ? \\n▁ do you realise what you ' ve done ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ i made an agreement to keep our monarchy safe for eternity , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` in exchange for a living being ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not entirely . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what does that mean ? '' \\n▁ he held out an upturned palm , offering me the floor . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be cryptic with me , ara . \\n▁ get to the point . '' \\n▁ i blinked a few extra times , trying to keep my cool . \\n▁ ` ` i would get to the point if you 'd shut up and let me speak . '' \\n▁ ` ` then speak ! '' \\n▁ g xxrep 3 r . \\n▁ ` ` instead of drake coming for my baby when she 's born , raising her in that hell hole , he 's agreed to let me keep her until she 's eighteen . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what then ? '' \\n▁ david asked sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` he 's gon na take her away from us ? '' \\n▁ ` ` us ? '' \\n▁ i said , half laughing with incredulity . \\n▁ ` ` there is no us , david . \\n▁ you said it yourself , she 's not your daughter . '' \\n▁ arthur looked at david quickly . \\n▁ ` ` you said that to her ? '' \\n▁ david looked away . \\n▁ ` ` so , he 's gone ? \\n▁ drake ? \\n▁ he 's gon na leave us alone until she 's eighteen ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , david , we get eighteen years of safety and … '' ` ` and then we lose our daughter , ara ! \\n▁ do you think you ' ve fixed this ? \\n▁ did you think that by swearing over your own flesh and blood it 'd make you a good queen ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i said through my teeth , stepping into him with fists tight . \\n▁ ` ` it makes me a great queen , david . \\n▁ because i am willing to put the safety of my people before my own flesh and blood - as every great leader before me , in the human and the supernatural world has or should do . \\n▁ what does a president do if his daughter is kidnapped and held for ransom ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he does not negotiate ! '' \\n▁ david yelled . \\n▁ ` ` and i did not negotiate , either . \\n▁ i could run . \\n▁ i could take the child away , but our people will die - my family , my friends , and for what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for her life . '' \\n▁ ` ` one life , '' i yelled . \\n▁ ` ` one life that will likely grow up and seek him out anyway , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` and why on earth would she do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because she is the reincarnated soul of anandene . '' \\n▁ david stumbled back a few steps , staring down at my belly . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you see ? \\n▁ i was given a choice to keep my people safe at the expense of myself , and i chose that road . \\n▁ i could not put our blood , our hopes or dreams before my people . \\n▁ and if i had it to do over , i 'd do it all the same . '' \\n▁ he turned away and looked out through the windows above the door . \\n▁ ` ` at least , this way , there is still hope . \\n▁ we can train her to be a fighter . \\n▁ we can spend the next eighteen years searching for a way to kill drake - '' ` ` there is no way to kill drake ! '' \\n▁ he spun around . \\n▁ ` ` he 's a monster . \\n▁ a godforsaken immortal demon , ara . \\n▁ and you promised him our - '' he broke then , holding his fist to his mouth . \\n▁ in the silence that lingered , the staff hurried past , busying themselves in the great hall , setting up for the ball tonight . \\n▁ we all stood there lost in our own thoughts , trying to find reason among the grey of uncertainty . \\n▁ none of what i 'd just told david could go any further than the four of us standing here right now , yet all of it had been exposed in open quarters . \\n▁ i worried then for the concealment of this secret . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd have done the same , son , '' arthur said , and all eyes turned to him . \\n▁ ` ` you know that . '' \\n▁ david did n't say anything . \\n▁ he just looked at me , then back at his uncle , and turned away , walking swiftly off toward the west wing . \\n▁ when he disappeared , finally out of earshot , i lowered my voice and muttered , ` ` it gets worse . '' \\n▁ ` ` what does ? '' \\n▁ arthur moved in a step , obviously catching on that whatever i was about to add was n't for all ears . \\n▁ ` ` drake told me that the dagger had been stolen once before - '' ` ` yes , many decades ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` he said it was a woman he trusted - that she brought it here . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' arthur said , nodding once , though he did n't seem to be following me . \\n▁ ` ` arthur , there is only one girl i can think of that 's linked both to drake and to the xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` morgaine , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and you said she knew about the dagger early on , that she changed the contract and made it look like a prophecy . \\n▁ i think she 's been plotting against us this whole time . '' \\n▁ ` ` we ' ve all had our suspicions about morgaine at one point , amara , but we ' ve no proof she 's against us - or a motive . \\n▁ she may have taken the dagger to protect you . '' \\n▁ ` ` protect me ? '' \\n▁ i scoffed . \\n▁ ` ` from what ? \\n▁ the dagger is useless , '' i lied . \\n▁ ` ` what i want to know is , if she took the dagger from drake , did she know all along that it would n't kill him ? \\n▁ and if she did , why did she let us believe it would ? \\n▁ what the hell is she playing at ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ask her , '' jase said simply . \\n▁ ` ` ask her ? '' \\n▁ i looked all the way up at him . \\n▁ ` ` what , just storm in there and ask her what the deal is ? '' \\n▁ he shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` why not ? \\n▁ i could come with you , read her mind - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i touched his arm . \\n▁ ` ` i need to take care of this myself . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ he took a step back , offering the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll see you at the meeting . \\n▁ want me to fill everyone in ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ thanks . '' \\n▁ i offered a smile and wandered away , practicing what i 'd say to morgaine in my head . \\n▁ it was time for a little clever leading . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` morgaine ? '' \\n▁ i shoved her door open without knocking , startling her . \\n▁ ` ` my queen ? '' \\n▁ she dumped her book on the bed and stood up . \\n▁ ` ` what brings you here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're off the council . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you heard me . \\n▁ you are officially fired . '' \\n▁ ` ` why , amara ? '' \\n▁ i stepped closer , lowering my voice , though i wanted to shout and scream in her face ; she was n't proven guilty yet , but my gut was very rarely wrong . \\n▁ ` ` you and i both know why . \\n▁ you 're a liar and a traitor , and while i promised drake not to expose you , '' i lied , ` ` that affords you no place in my good graces , nor among a group of people i trust implicitly . \\n▁ you 're the enemy , morgaine , and i want you out of this manor . '' \\n▁ ` ` drake told you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he told me many things . \\n▁ i know all about the dagger . \\n▁ i know all about the contract , and i know that this child i carry is … '' i paused , hoping she 'd fill in the rest . \\n▁ i needed to see just how much she really knew . \\n▁ ` ` anandene , '' she said to her feet . \\n▁ ` ` how long have you known ? \\n▁ how long have you been aware that david and i would bear the antichrist ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she wo n't be the antichrist , amara . '' \\n▁ she moved closer , dropping her reaching hand when she read the very clear signal i gave off not to touch me . \\n▁ ` ` she 's a pure vessel . \\n▁ she 'll be - '' ` ` she 'll be fine until her memories return , and then she 'll be an evil witch that 'll seek to marry her own uncle . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ she tucked a strand of her cherry hair back , shaking her head . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't want this any more than you , but - '' ` ` so you knew ? \\n▁ you forced david and i together so we 'd have this child - letting us believe she 'd kill drake - bring peace ? \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ a frown crinkled her brow , narrowing her eyes as they moved onto my face . \\n▁ ` ` if you do n't know the answer to that , then drake did n't tell you anything about who i am or what i ' m doing here . \\n▁ nice try , amara . '' \\n▁ she opened her door . \\n▁ ` ` you can leave now . '' \\n▁ my hand shot out and slammed the door closed again , holding it in place . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not going anywhere until i get the truth . '' \\n▁ ` ` the truth ? '' \\n▁ she took a few steps back . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't owe you anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` that . \\n▁ is where . \\n▁ you are wrong , '' i said through my teeth . \\n▁ ` ` you owe me for your safety . \\n▁ your freedom . \\n▁ and you will either tell me the truth , or i will torture it out of you . '' \\n▁ ` ` fine . '' \\n▁ she stormed off and sat down heavily on her bed . \\n▁ ` ` but you wo n't like it . \\n▁ and when you find out what it is , you ca n't touch me . \\n▁ you ca n't force me to leave , and you can not tell a soul , because if you do , my uncle will see to it that the dagger is used for its true purpose . '' \\n▁ the floor fell out from under me . \\n▁ i stood frozen on the spot , clutching my tummy to stop the tightening . \\n▁ ` ` your uncle ? '' \\n▁ she drew a breath and let it out , averting her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` my name is not morgaine , amara . \\n▁ it 's - '' ` ` morgana . '' \\n▁ i exhaled the word , standing there like a fool for a few seconds after as it all sunk in . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not helping drake because i want him to have a happy ending , amara , '' she said , folding her legs up under her on the bed . \\n▁ ` ` i just want my mother back - want the life back that he took from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` took from you ? \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ took . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , i ' m gon na need you to elaborate , morgaine . '' \\n▁ she kind of groaned , rolling her eyes as most people did when i did n't ` catch on ' to the full story immediately , despite not having any of the facts . \\n▁ ` ` from the moment he met anandene , '' she began , ` ` all he cared about was being with her . \\n▁ he stopped caring about his little sister , and when he became my guardian , he did n't even care that i was left without anyone to love me - a small child dumped in a cottage on the outskirts of town until i was twenty - five , with nothing but monthly visits from my uncle to tell me i 'd see my mother again when she 'd completed her task . \\n▁ i never even got to say goodbye to her . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , morgana . \\n▁ that 's … '' i walked over and sat down slowly beside her . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't even imagine how awful that would ' ve been . '' \\n▁ she offered a smile . \\n▁ ` ` my grandmother lived there too . \\n▁ i guess i was n't really alone . \\n▁ and she taught me witchcraft and told me stories , but i never saw any other children , never saw the world . \\n▁ never really knew my mother . \\n▁ never even knew why she left me . '' \\n▁ ` ` drake did n't tell you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not until i was old enough to leave the cottage on my own . \\n▁ by that point , he 'd lost the child of my mother 's re - manifested soul , and all hope with it . \\n▁ he told me i 'd never see her again but that he could feed me blood - make me immortal - if i promised to hide my true identity . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you became morgaine , a created lilithian . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and i built an army - destroyed the last page of the contract , and made it look like a prophecy so that , if drake 's warriors ever found another lilithian , my army could ` ` save '' her and keep her safe , without drake being implicated and the truth about anandene coming out . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , he knew you built the core ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` it was his idea . '' \\n▁ i rubbed my brow . \\n▁ ` ` why did you need to hide the truth about anandene so deeply ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because many would seek to stop it happening - on the belief that bringing things back to life in that manner is the devil 's work , that it 's unnatural and will bring a curse . '' \\n▁ ` ` is there any truth in that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` none , '' she said with a gentle laugh . \\n▁ ` ` but there are so many lies , '' i said , looking off at nothing , amazed at the depth of it all and how the hell she kept up with it when even i could n't . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve clearly had to rearrange the story every time we turned over a new leaf , right - xxunk them to make them fit ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` why not just tell me the truth in the beginning ? '' \\n▁ ` ` and have you thwart a mission that has taken centuries to complete ? '' \\n▁ ` ` morg , '' i said , and waited for her to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` if you told me it would be my life instead of david 's , i 'd have signed the dotted line myself . \\n▁ do n't you know that ? '' \\n▁ her dark eyes studied mine intently , flowing past them and over the shape of my cheekbones , my lips , and back to my eyes again . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know that then . \\n▁ i thought the only way to bribe you into ruling the people and having a baby would be if you could kill drake . \\n▁ when that was n't enough , i had to find your currency . '' \\n▁ ` ` currency ? '' \\n▁ she nodded solemnly . \\n▁ ` ` i realised that life was more important to you than death , so i told you about freeing the damned . \\n▁ and that 's the moment everything changed - when you finally snapped out of that trance you 'd been in and found the will to fight . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you used my love and compassion to make me do what you wanted , just so you could have your mother back ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and i do n't regret it , amara . \\n▁ i never cared about the safety and freedom of the xxunk - every one of them can die for all i care . \\n▁ and , as for the damned … they 're better off dead . '' \\n▁ my teeth ground tightly in my mouth . \\n▁ i just wanted to hit her . \\n▁ ` ` why tell david he had to die then ? \\n▁ why make up the lie about the dagger ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i did n't . \\n▁ that was drake and jason 's fault . '' \\n▁ ` ` how so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` a few centuries after i realised drake had failed and this child would never be born , i took the dagger as an insurance policy - to put my mother back together . \\n▁ all i needed was the key to her tomb and the child who had her soul . \\n▁ drake knew i took the dagger and hid it here , but he did n't know where . \\n▁ he created a parchment that told of the dagger 's power , said that it would kill him , in the hopes someone might try to do just that . '' \\n▁ ` ` and he 'd get it back . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ he sent arthur to find it for him so i could n't ruin his plans and bring my mother back before the child was born . \\n▁ but jason found the document and sent it to david anonymously . \\n▁ from then on , everything changed , and it was no longer about using the power of the child to free the damned and kill drake . \\n▁ it was suddenly about david being the martyr . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i had to go to great lengths to slow things down , '' she added . \\n▁ ` ` i made up the bit about the hand of the king needing to drive the dagger to give us time . \\n▁ otherwise , he 'd have left to kill drake that day , and he was n't even planning to say goodbye . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , i guess i owe you thanks , then ? '' \\n▁ i asked sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` well , no , because it would n't have worked . \\n▁ and drake would n't have killed david . \\n▁ he needed him to make a baby with you . '' \\n▁ my hands went absently across my belly . \\n▁ ` ` this is all so messed up . '' \\n▁ ` ` imagine how i feel then ? '' \\n▁ her neck jutted forward a bit . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't built to lie , amara . \\n▁ and this whole thing has been one big lie after another . \\n▁ i lost track so many times i do n't how any of you possibly believed me . '' \\n▁ i laughed , though i was n't amused . \\n▁ ` ` you did a pretty good job . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , what 's your plan now , morgana ? \\n▁ are you helping drake or trying to resurrect lilith ? '' \\n▁ ` ` honestly ? '' \\n▁ her brows rose , prompting my response . \\n▁ ` ` a shred of honesty would be great . '' \\n▁ ` ` i need the key to her tomb . \\n▁ i have the soul , i know where the dagger is , and all i need is that damn key , and then i 'll free my mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` and i 'll die . '' \\n▁ she shrugged dismissively . \\n▁ my shoulders dropped . \\n▁ ` ` where 's the key then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ her arms wrapped both her knees . \\n▁ ` ` drake has one key , which i will never , in a million years , get my hands on . \\n▁ and the other key … it was held by the goddess lilith , my great grandmother . '' \\n▁ ` ` so … where is she now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` here . '' \\n▁ she motioned around the place . \\n▁ ` ` she 's the guardian of the earth . \\n▁ you call her mother nature . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ my stomach dropped into my feet . \\n▁ i was pretty sure then that i knew exactly where that key was . \\n▁ ` ` and … what does the key look like ? '' \\n▁ morg shrugged again . \\n▁ ` ` all i know is that it 's enchanted - has a life force of its own . \\n▁ you know it only by the energy it carries - something that makes it seem … alive . '' \\n▁ i laid a hand to my chest , right over the key i 'd found on my walk of faith . \\n▁ silence hung in the room for a while then , the clock on her dresser keeping the time with a steady tick . \\n▁ ` ` what if you never find the key ? \\n▁ her dark eyes moved onto mine . \\n▁ ` ` then i go with plan b. '' ` ` plan b ? '' \\n▁ ` ` help drake get anandene . '' \\n▁ ` ` neither of which will be possible for you now , morgana , '' i snapped . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't just let you walk around freely , plotting against us . '' \\n▁ ` ` you have no choice , '' she stated . \\n▁ ` ` actually , i do , and - '' ` ` and i bet drake threatened you , forced you to keep everything a secret on pain of death , and i doubt it was your death but , rather , someone you love , '' she suggested . \\n▁ my nails formed deep impressions on my palms . \\n▁ ` ` you know him well . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do . '' \\n▁ she tapped my hands , making me unfold them . \\n▁ ` ` a few centuries alongside one man will do that . '' \\n▁ ` ` alongside ? '' \\n▁ i asked , hinting on the rumours i 'd heard about her drake having been … together . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ alongside . \\n▁ but not in the manner your tone suggests , amara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i heard you slept with him . '' \\n▁ ` ` we started that rumour because it was the only convincing reason why he would be so protective of me , you know - allow a lilithian to walk freely . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , it 's not true ? \\n▁ you never , er - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i did spend many nights in his bed , but not for impure reasons . \\n▁ i just … i was safe there - with him . '' \\n▁ ` ` safe ? \\n▁ were n't you safe anywhere in the castle if you were drake 's girl ? '' \\n▁ her head moved sideways . \\n▁ ` ` i killed a man once - a vampire . '' \\n▁ ` ` killed ? '' \\n▁ i frowned , and then it clicked : she had venom like mine . \\n▁ ` ` i was asleep one night when i heard my door open and then close again . \\n▁ i called out to see who it was , but no one answered . \\n▁ next thing i know , there 's a man pinning my arms down . \\n▁ i screamed out , tried to fight him off . \\n▁ but no one came . \\n▁ so … i bit him . \\n▁ and he died . \\n▁ uncle drake had to go to great lengths to cover it up . \\n▁ he hid the body in the floorboards and that 's where it stayed . \\n▁ it 's still there now . '' \\n▁ i rubbed my head . \\n▁ ` ` so you had venom , vampire - killing venom , all this time ? \\n▁ and you never helped the damned , or - '' ` ` i do n't care about the damned , amara ! \\n▁ if i used my venom to help anyone - if drake used it to help anyone , it would have given me away . \\n▁ the whole mission could ' ve been compromised . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you let them suffer because you wanted your mom back ? '' \\n▁ her jaw went tight , eyes small and sharp . \\n▁ ` ` what would you do , amara , to bring your mother back ? '' \\n▁ ` ` well , that would n't even be a question if drake had n't killed her ! '' \\n▁ ` ` he - '' she started , but mashed her lips tightly together and folded her arms like a smug little brat . \\n▁ ` ` it was a means to an end . '' \\n▁ ` ` a means to an end ! '' \\n▁ i stood up . \\n▁ ` ` a means to an end ? '' \\n▁ she stood , too . \\n▁ ` ` your life means nothing , amara . \\n▁ you are a means to an end - all of this is . \\n▁ and as soon as that child is born , none of you will exist . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's where you 're wrong , '' i said smugly . \\n▁ ` ` drake swore to leave david on the throne , and that all my friends , my family and my people would be safe for eternity . \\n▁ and … '' i paused to build suspense , just enjoying this moment : when she found out what else he promised , it would hurt her just as deeply as it hurt me to know my mother died for this cause . \\n▁ ` ` he promised me eighteen years to raise my child . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ! '' \\n▁ ` ` you heard me . \\n▁ he has the dagger now , so you wo n't be seeing your dead mommy any time soon , morgana . \\n▁ and , in the meantime , you need to find yourself a new job - and a new home . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't kick me out ! '' \\n▁ i turned toward the door . \\n▁ ` ` i just did . '' \\n▁ she grabbed my arm and spun me around . \\n▁ ` ` if i leave , people will ask questions . \\n▁ and drake will just put another spy in place to watch over you . '' \\n▁ my eyes closed involuntarily around the truth . \\n▁ ` ` better the devil you know , '' she added . \\n▁ ` ` fine . '' \\n▁ i opened my eyes , hearing the old idiom in my head : keep your enemies close . \\n▁ ` ` stay . \\n▁ but you 're no longer on my council . \\n▁ neither is david . \\n▁ and you will move your things out immediately and take them down to jason 's old room . '' \\n▁ ` ` old room ? '' \\n▁ she frowned . \\n▁ ` ` where 's his new one ? '' \\n▁ i rolled my head slowly higher , smirking . \\n▁ ` ` you 're standing in it . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' ` ` you have twenty minutes . '' \\n▁ i turned on my heel and walked from the room , leaving the door open on my way out . \\n▁ life is never lonelier than when you hide a truth that 's weighing you down . \\n▁ i looked across the dinner table at falcon , then at jason , just wishing i could tell someone , anyone what drake had told me . \\n▁ all my council even knew was that morgaine had been fired for siding with david too often and that we 'd recently discovered the dagger of xxunk was useless . \\n▁ i did n't tell them i 'd met with drake and i did n't tell them i was the living re - manifestation of the former queen 's soul . \\n▁ i did lie and say jason might have a toxic potion that could kill an original , and that was the only thing that kept them in their seats when they realised david could n't . \\n▁ the people , however , would remain under the impression that the dagger was safe and still as useful as before . \\n▁ with time to think after the meeting today , everything drake said sunk in bit by bit - pieces i did n't want to think about rising to the front of my thoughts all afternoon . \\n▁ i wanted to fight - to find some way i could stop him from killing me in eighteen years , but that would mean putting the baby in danger and possibly making drake angry enough to break our agreement . \\n▁ but it was n't just that . \\n▁ i slumped on my hand . \\n▁ he killed my mom and my baby brother , and he did it because i refused to go to my dad 's that year . \\n▁ if i 'd just gone - if i 'd just stuck to the plans we made every year , they 'd still be alive . \\n▁ ` ` baby ? '' \\n▁ mike laid his hand over mine . \\n▁ i looked up from my lap and smiled . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ he mimed , not actually speaking . \\n▁ i nodded , rearranging my napkin in my lap . \\n▁ ` ` you look like you 're about to cry . '' \\n▁ my stupid chin quivered then . \\n▁ i drew a quiet but jagged breath and forced another smile , catching falcon 's eye when he looked up . \\n▁ he gave me that look - the one asking what was going on , and when jason frowned , noticing the exchange then turning his worried eyes on me , i could n't help it ; a soft breath burst from between my lips , and i sobbed hard at the dinner table , with mike 's arms suddenly wrapping me , my tears falling onto my plate . \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on ? '' \\n▁ david stood and threw his napkin down . \\n▁ ` ` uh , just … pregnancy hormones , '' emily said casually , running over with her arms flailing about in the air . \\n▁ a few people laughed affectionately , and i was swept out of the room , not really knowing whose hands were guiding me . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know , '' mike said , answering some question i had n't heard . \\n▁ ` ` i asked her what 's wrong , and she just … '' ` ` mike , do n't you know ? \\n▁ never ask someone what 's wrong if they look they 're about to cry , '' emily said , sliding her arm around me . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? \\n▁ what happened ? \\n▁ did david - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i moved away from her . \\n▁ ` ` david did n't do anything . \\n▁ i … i just needed some air . '' \\n▁ she looked at mike , and he threw his hands up , backing away . \\n▁ ` ` girl stuff . \\n▁ got ya . \\n▁ i 'll leave you to it . '' \\n▁ i wanted to grab him and ask him to stay - wanted to tell him that the woman he grew up with beside me died for no good reason . \\n▁ it was n't an act of god or fate . \\n▁ it was murder . \\n▁ senseless murder . \\n▁ but he would , at the very least , cause a scene over it . \\n▁ no one would understand my anger and agony better than him . \\n▁ but i just could n't trust him to stay calm if he knew . \\n▁ so , i let him walk away , em and i smiling as he gave some obviously hilarious explanation to smooth things over back in the great hall . \\n▁ david made a smart remark that i did n't hear , but i also did n't care what he said about me . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ falcon turned me to face him , closing emily out of the circle . \\n▁ ` ` what happened ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't talk about it . '' \\n▁ he frowned at me , his hands going tighter on my arms for a second , his eyes narrowing in question , slightly flicking on to emily . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ she was n't the reason i could n't talk . \\n▁ ` ` ara , '' he said , ` ` you know you can trust me with anything , even if it was something you were n't allowed to tell anyone . '' \\n▁ ` ` can i trust you not to do anything about it , to act as if i never told you ? '' \\n▁ he went to say something , closing his mouth with a little pop after , his shoulders sinking . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ if it 's just an ear you need , of course . '' \\n▁ i turned and glanced back at emily . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , em . \\n▁ i 'll be okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` i get it . '' \\n▁ she reversed away . \\n▁ ` ` not for my ears . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's for your own protection . '' \\n▁ ` ` more like so i wo n't tell david . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , em , '' i started , but she disappeared . \\n▁ ` ` forget it , ara . \\n▁ if that 's the attitude she has , she 's better off outside the circle of trust . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` she 's just got her nose out of joint . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , well , she 's also still very close to david . \\n▁ anything you do n't want him to know , you probably should n't tell her . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 'd never say anything to him . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , but he can read her mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ i looked at my shoes . \\n▁ ` ` i really hate that ` special connection ' they have . '' \\n▁ falcon laughed through his nose . \\n▁ ` ` it 's pretty odd . \\n▁ drives blade crazy , too . '' \\n▁ ` ` has he told her , yet - that he 's … '' ` ` no , '' he said , his lips staying in the shape of the o for a bit too long . \\n▁ ` ` and you 'd better not say anything , either . '' \\n▁ i crossed my heart . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ now - '' he laid his hand firmly on my shoulder , almost like a gentle slap . \\n▁ ` ` what 's got you so upset ? '' \\n▁ i looked back into the great hall . \\n▁ ` ` not here . \\n▁ okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ bedroom . '' \\n▁ we walked in silence up to my room and , once there , falcon barely even shut the door before i broke down and told him the whole story - everything i needed off my chest and everything i was n't allowed to tell him , even about morgana . \\n▁ i let it all pour out . \\n▁ and he just stood there while i paced back and forth , holding as still as a statue until i finished and looked at him , tears streaming down my cheeks and said , ` ` so ? \\n▁ what do i do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' he stumbled clumsily backward and sat down on my blanket box , rubbing the tops of his thighs . \\n▁ ` ` ara , i ' m so sorry . \\n▁ i do n't know where to start . '' \\n▁ i wiped my face , just waiting for a word of wisdom or maybe even comfort . \\n▁ ` ` have you told david any of this ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you wo n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` mike ? '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` god , no . '' \\n▁ he laughed , too , then stood up and wandered over , drawing me in for a very needed hug . \\n▁ his big hand squeezed my hair flat to the back of my neck while the other rubbed my back , just leaving everything unsaid for a few moments . \\n▁ ` ` you poor kid . '' \\n▁ i sunk into him a bit more then , drying the corner of my eye on his shirt . \\n▁ ` ` i just … i ' m so sorry he killed your mom . '' \\n▁ ` ` me too . '' \\n▁ ` ` but … '' he looked down at me , leaving his hand on the side of my neck . \\n▁ ` ` you know that 's not your fault , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` but i - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ his grip tightened . \\n▁ ` ` drake chose to kill her . \\n▁ drake lost anandene and he created a contract , and everything he has done in pursuit of that is on his head , ara , not yours . \\n▁ you did not do this . '' \\n▁ ` ` i want to believe that , but if i 'd never - '' ` ` then believe it . \\n▁ because if i thought you were to blame , i 'd tell you that , counsel you on that . \\n▁ but you 're not . \\n▁ no matter how much you convince yourself , ara , you did n't kill her . \\n▁ you were a spoiled teenage brat , but that was n't the reason she died . \\n▁ drake was the reason . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , to force me into dad 's custody . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` stop trying to lay blame where it wo n't fit . '' \\n▁ i stared at the floor , reversing the situation in my head . \\n▁ what would i say to him if this were his problem ? \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . \\n▁ you are . \\n▁ i know you are . \\n▁ the fact is , drake ordered her death , like she was some pawn . \\n▁ and he needs to pay . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , he does . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m gon na kill him . \\n▁ i ' m gon na go over there right now , and i ' m - '' ` ` whoa , whoa , whoa , little lady . \\n▁ let 's not go that far just yet . '' \\n▁ he steadied me with a stop - sign hand . \\n▁ ` ` control those crazy pregnancy hormones . '' \\n▁ he laughed , making me laugh a bit , too . \\n▁ ` ` you have nothing to back you here . \\n▁ if you go against him , he 'll take your soul and give it back to lilith . \\n▁ he has the dagger , remember . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , what am i supposed to do ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged , hands out . \\n▁ ` ` just let him get away with this ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ but do n't go rushing in there waving the sword of revenge , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` we have eighteen years to devise a plan . \\n▁ let 's be smart about this . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , '' i started , then stopped , shaking my head . \\n▁ he was right again . \\n▁ ` ` see ? '' \\n▁ i pouted mockingly , bringing one shoulder up . \\n▁ ` ` this is why i always come to you . \\n▁ you 're good at this . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` no , i ' m good at ara - control . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` so , any ideas on how we can get revenge ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , wait until little bubba is born . '' \\n▁ he touched my belly . \\n▁ ` ` and then we 'll discuss it . \\n▁ but i want her safe and alive before we do anything that might put you or your soul at risk . '' \\n▁ ` ` you mean lilith 's soul , '' i said spitefully . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he grabbed both my shoulders again . \\n▁ ` ` your soul . \\n▁ she gave it to you - well , your mother gave it to you . \\n▁ possession is nine - tenths of the law , do n't you know ? '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but right now i ' m possessed by a raw need for vengeance . '' \\n▁ he laughed , throwing his head back a bit , and the tension in the room eased so much then . \\n▁ even my own need to cry had lifted , the weight a little less overbearing , especially since i knew that pathetic attempt at a joke was n't even funny . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll sort this out , m ` kay ? '' \\n▁ he looked me in the eye , lowering his chin a little to prompt a response . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ okay . \\n▁ thanks , falcon . '' \\n▁ ` ` any time . '' \\n▁ he stood back again . \\n▁ ` ` and what about morgana ? \\n▁ what are you doing with her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` keeping an eye on her . \\n▁ that 's all i can do . '' \\n▁ he nodded in agreement , taking a really deep , shoulder - lifting breath . \\n▁ ` ` what a mess . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're telling me . '' \\n▁ we both laughed then , more to blow out the tension than because of amusement . \\n▁ and falcon just smiled , standing tall again like the knight i 'd come to respect so much , his expression alight with a mix of compassion and something else i did n't recognise . \\n▁ ` ` you might want to consider telling david some of what you told me . '' \\n▁ ` ` which bit ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the bit about your mom . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because he should know . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it 's devastating , ara . \\n▁ i know he 's been a prick to you since this jason thing came out , and i really do n't think you , or your baby - '' he presented us , '' - need him treating you that way . \\n▁ if he knew the grief you were suffering right now , i think he 'd back off a bit . '' \\n▁ i shook my head at the ground . \\n▁ ` ` he wo n't let me speak to him long enough to tell him something like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` want me to tell him ? '' \\n▁ for a moment , i considered it , considered the reaction david would have . \\n▁ but something told me it would n't be compassion . \\n▁ he would n't back off if he knew the truth . \\n▁ this horrid david that 'd taken over the man i loved would probably use it to hurt me . \\n▁ ` ` nah , '' i said , meeting his eye . \\n▁ ` ` leave it to me . \\n▁ i 'll tell him when the time is right . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ if you 're sure ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` if i change my mind , i know where to find you . '' \\n▁ he placed a hand to his chest and bowed . \\n▁ ` ` always at your side , my queen . '' \\n▁ chapter fourteen ` ` this ball will be the same as every other formal event , '' falcon advised . \\n▁ ` ` david will escort you from the second floor into the ballroom and , once there , you 'll engage in the first dance of the evening . \\n▁ after a few turns on the dance floor , the guests will be asked to join you . '' \\n▁ i nodded , repositioning my crown where it slipped a little toward my brow . \\n▁ magda had designed my dress around this gold headpiece , combining the style with the pale colour scheme of the ` winter falls ' decorations in the ballroom , creating a final product that was worthy of elizabeth i , queen of england . \\n▁ fine gold weaving ran in two lines down the front panel of the dress , like woven glitter , while the silky cream fabric caught the light just so , showing the delicate floral pattern within . \\n▁ the dress had come together nicely , mentioned in the lilithian times as , ` ` a gold and cream victorian gown with a modern xxunk edge to it . '' \\n▁ it looked like a ball gown one would ' ve worn with a high grey coiffure in the eighteenth century , but instead of long sleeves and a puffy bottom , we 'd removed the sleeve all together , making it strapless , falling from the waist in a smaller , more elegant puff . \\n▁ my tiny belly was hidden completely under the drop of the skirt , and my hair had been tied up and stacked high on my head , with curls dangling softly around my face . \\n▁ the only thing i hated was the horrid gold heel they 'd put me in to account for both david 's height and the length of the dress . \\n▁ i was n't sure i could walk in the shoes , let alone dance . \\n▁ ` ` what are you worrying about , ara ? '' \\n▁ falcon asked . \\n▁ ` ` oh , nothing . '' \\n▁ i forced a smile , noticing suddenly that he 'd been studying my face . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay . '' \\n▁ he drew his hands from behind his back and placed one around me . \\n▁ ` ` you look a bit pale . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just nervous . '' \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ i checked over my shoulder then off to both sides , making sure david was n't around . \\n▁ ` ` dancing with the king . '' \\n▁ falcon did n't say anything to that . \\n▁ he just exhaled loudly , directing his attention to the crack between the slightly open doors to the great hall , where , from up here on the second floor landing , we could both watch the scene beyond . \\n▁ hundreds of people , by invitation only , had gathered to celebrate the miracle of life . \\n▁ round tables decked in white cloths occupied the left side of the room , the giant picture of lilith overlooking , while the right of the room , just by the piano , had been left open as a dance floor . \\n▁ couples waltzed around the space , all smiling and radiant , with the candlelight echoing warm sentiments around them , charming the pale - coloured clothing like strings of gold . \\n▁ i could n't see jason anywhere in there . \\n▁ he had the right to be there now that he was on my council , though , but i had n't spoken to david yet - hadn ' t been told what his reaction was , and was n't sure if he was going to willingly stand by and allow it , or if he might think to stop it by any means necessary . \\n▁ including by locking jason up for tonight . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , falcon , '' david said dismissively , stepping up out of nowhere . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll see you inside . '' \\n▁ falcon glanced back at david , and lowered his head to mine , keeping his arm around me . \\n▁ ` ` you be okay ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be on the dance floor , right below you . \\n▁ just whisper my name if you need me , '' he hinted . \\n▁ i nodded again , my chest too full of air to speak . \\n▁ ` ` i said , i 'll take it from here , '' david reiterated . \\n▁ ` ` good luck , ara . '' \\n▁ falcon moved back as the king stood between us . \\n▁ ` ` and be careful on the stairs in those shoes . '' \\n▁ ` ` i will . '' \\n▁ i smiled softly at him . \\n▁ ` ` stop worrying , falcon . \\n▁ go enjoy yourself . \\n▁ i 'll be fine , i swear . '' \\n▁ he exhaled , trying to smile , but he did n't like leaving me up here , alone , with david . \\n▁ especially since the amendment of the marital laws had n't been passed through the upper house yet . \\n▁ ` ` amendment , or not , '' david said to falcon . \\n▁ ` ` i would never do anything to physically hurt the girl . '' \\n▁ falcon bowed once and trotted down the entranceway stairs behind us . \\n▁ ` ` are you ready ? '' \\n▁ david asked , slipping a white glove onto his hand . \\n▁ ` ` yup . '' \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ then let 's get this over with . '' \\n▁ he walked forward , not even offering his arm , and the doors swung open , the footmen on the other side bowing their heads as we entered the room . \\n▁ the flow of dancing stopped below like a swirl of water ending suddenly , a few still going until they looked over their shoulders at the announcement of the king and the queen . \\n▁ all the pale colours , warmed with the yellow light , made the room look like a painting , something too fantastical to be real . \\n▁ ` ` it 's so beautiful . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' david said , bowing to our guests . \\n▁ ` ` it is . '' \\n▁ we stood atop the stairs for a moment then , giving them all time to take us in . \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ i said under my breath . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why would n't i be ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't condone this , '' i said simply , touching my belly . \\n▁ ` ` it must be hard for you to celebrate something you despise . '' \\n▁ david said nothing in return , but even if he did , i would n't have heard , because my attention was swept away from our private conversation to arthur , sitting behind the piano , tossing out the traditional entrance lullaby and replacing it with a muse song . \\n▁ ` ` is he mad ? '' \\n▁ i said excitedly . \\n▁ ` ` i love this song ! '' \\n▁ david frowned down at me . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't even know you knew it . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you kidding ? \\n▁ you know how much i love muse . '' \\n▁ ` ` come then . \\n▁ it 's time to enter , '' he muttered , and took off . \\n▁ i grabbed hold of the railing and placed my wobbly heel to the first step , searching my peripheral for david 's arm in case i needed to grab it . \\n▁ but his hands were behind his back , clearly being kept away from any risk of touching me . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll have to touch me when we 're dancing , you know ? '' \\n▁ i said , hiding my moving lips behind the smile i offered the crowd . \\n▁ ` ` why do you think i wore gloves ? '' \\n▁ i scoffed in the back of my throat , not meaning to . \\n▁ ` ` you know , you do n't have to be so - '' ` ` careful . '' \\n▁ his hand wrapped my back suddenly ; the other one grabbing my arm , hitching me upright again as i nearly flew forward , and the quiet gasp of the crowd forced my eyes onto all the shocked faces below . \\n▁ my heart thundered in my chest , my gaze meeting falcon 's then , who closed his eyes , clutching his own chest . \\n▁ david lifted my dress angrily , yanking the skirt out from under the toe of my shoe . \\n▁ ` ` this dress is too long . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's supposed to be . '' \\n▁ ` ` you need to lift it at the front when you walk , ara . \\n▁ did n't anyone teach you that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we - '' he grabbed a handful of fabric and stuffed it in my hand , closing my fingers around it . \\n▁ ` ` walk carefully . \\n▁ i will not catch you again . '' \\n▁ ` ` you would n't have anyway , were it not for all these people watching . '' \\n▁ he looked over the room , resuming his kingly posture , and started walking . \\n▁ i followed , this time holding my dress above my shoes . \\n▁ and we entered the ball with a bit more grace than we 'd started with , david offering his hand on the last step and drawing me finally close to him as we fluttered like a breeze onto the dance floor . \\n▁ he positioned our arms widely , with absolutely perfect form , and i caught a glimpse of us in the giant glass windows overlooking the gardens : a man in a suit of black and white , his not - so - beloved queen standing a few inches shorter than him - their backs so straight , their steps so swift and graceful , the whole scene like something from a fairy - tale . \\n▁ he looked nice in a suit , his kingly sash across his chest , distinguishing him from the rest of the men in the room , and i felt proud to be in his arms and also sad , because i knew this would be the last time . \\n▁ the other guests joined the dance floor then , david and i stepping in smaller circles to make room for them , changing our stride so effortlessly one would think we 'd danced together for centuries . \\n▁ i looked up at his face to take him in ; he was clean - shaven , his dark hair brushed back , tidy and almost too clean . \\n▁ but the coldness in his eyes made the green stand out more , and i could n't help but smile as he looked down at me . \\n▁ ` ` what was that look for ? '' \\n▁ i asked , noticing a very coy kind of almost smile on his face , too . \\n▁ his hand moved slightly more around my rib . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve filled out since i last held … since we last danced . '' \\n▁ my smile dropped . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` i warned you about those brownies . '' \\n▁ ` ` magda says i ' m not fat - that it 's just a part of being pregnant , you know , that you lose your child 's figure and become more of a woman . '' \\n▁ ` ` being pregnant does not make you more of a woman , ara . \\n▁ that 's done by your actions alone . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but , she meant that the body changed - became more womanly . '' \\n▁ ` ` and since when is magda the expert ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she 's not . \\n▁ i guess . '' \\n▁ i lowered my gaze onto david 's white bowtie . \\n▁ ` ` how much longer is this dance ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's been too long already . '' \\n▁ he stiffened just a little , angling his chin so it sat further away from the top of my head . \\n▁ but his eyes kept drifting downward , brushing over my face , my hair , my gown . \\n▁ my smile returned . \\n▁ ` ` you know , i can read your mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` i highly doubt that . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i can . \\n▁ and you wo n't say it , but you think i look pretty tonight . '' \\n▁ he stared down at me , his face suddenly devoid of all emotion . \\n▁ ` ` i think no such thing . \\n▁ i barely even noticed you . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ i get it . \\n▁ i know you hate me , but you do n't have to be so mean . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was not my intention to be mean , ara . \\n▁ simply to state that you 're fooled if you think you enter even one of my thoughts in a day - particularly when it comes to my opinion of your appearance . \\n▁ quite frankly , if i ' m honest , cream makes you look washed - out , and your head looks too big for your body when you do your hair that way . '' \\n▁ that hurt . \\n▁ deeply . \\n▁ but i brushed it off , flicked him a quirky grin and said , ` ` i thought you said you did n't really notice me . '' \\n▁ ` ` just dance , girl . \\n▁ or this will end with you tripping and accidentally snapping your ankle - rendering you useless for the evening . '' \\n▁ i shut my gob then and just danced , letting out the breath i 'd held when the song finally ended and mike stepped up to take over . \\n▁ ` ` may i ? '' \\n▁ he said with a bow . \\n▁ i grabbed his arm and practically ran away with him . \\n▁ ` ` you okay , baby ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he threatened to snap my leg , '' i whispered , leaning close . \\n▁ mike laughed , turning to face me . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he wanted me to shut up . '' \\n▁ ` ` did it work ? \\n▁ did you shut up ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , glancing back at david ; he was holding emily close now , the girl throwing her head back , laughing at something he whispered into her hair . \\n▁ ` ` well , i 'll have to remember that one , '' mike said playfully . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you start . '' \\n▁ he just laughed again . \\n▁ ` ` you know he would n't actually do that , ara , right ? '' \\n▁ i felt myself shrink a little . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not really so sure about that . '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , ar . '' \\n▁ mike dropped my hand from position and wrapped me up in a very informal hug . \\n▁ ` ` if he does anything to hurt you or upset you , you come tell me . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ what can you do about it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we 're still buddies . \\n▁ i 'll talk to him . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't . \\n▁ otherwise he 'll think i ' ve been complaining about him . '' \\n▁ ` ` so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` so , then he 'll just make life harder . '' \\n▁ ` ` harder ? '' \\n▁ he raised a brow . \\n▁ ` ` what 's he doing to make it hard now ? \\n▁ you two are never even in the same room . '' \\n▁ i wanted to roll my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ it does n't matter . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , it does matter . '' \\n▁ his voice peaked higher on the end . \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on , ara ? '' \\n▁ a few guests passed us and offered congratulations on the baby , mike and i taking a moment from our conversation to humour them , and as they danced away again , the music stopped suddenly , mike looking off to his right when a man tapped his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` may i ? '' \\n▁ jason asked , stepping into view . \\n▁ ` ` you may . '' \\n▁ mike laid my hand in jason 's , patting his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` just return her in one piece this time , mate - unlike the last ball . '' \\n▁ jason stiffened , catching my eye quickly . \\n▁ ` ` i - '' ` ` he was just joking , jase . '' \\n▁ i smiled , watching mike blend in with the crowd . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't funny , '' he said , taking me up in his arms like i was some precious stone . \\n▁ ` ` i think he 's just trying to show us that he 's passed all that now . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , he 's not . \\n▁ he 's just holding it together for you tonight . '' \\n▁ i nodded , feeling my crown brush jason 's jaw . \\n▁ ` ` how did the meeting go today - before i got there ? \\n▁ were they nice ? '' \\n▁ ` ` surprisingly ? '' \\n▁ he said , pausing for a second . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` was mike ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he was quiet , but i think he knew there was no point arguing my position . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ i ' m sure he 'll have something to say about it in private , but i ' m ready for him . '' \\n▁ jase shook his head , smiling distantly . \\n▁ ` ` just do n't upset yourself over it . \\n▁ i can always counsel you privately , if need be . '' \\n▁ ` ` the need wo n't arise , '' i said , and left it at that , focusing on the rhythm of our dance for a while instead . \\n▁ jase always was such a magnificent dancer . \\n▁ he had a kind of grace and fluidity that david lacked . \\n▁ i guess it came from being so in touch with his emotions - not being afraid to feel or being seen to feel . \\n▁ there was this strange sensation that always came with it , too , much like that connection david and i had one of the first times we went out to the lake : the … gravitational pull . \\n▁ ` ` has anyone told you how beautiful you look tonight ? '' \\n▁ jase asked , distracting my thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` of course . '' \\n▁ he leaned down a little and kissed my head . \\n▁ ` ` when i saw you up there - '' he nodded to the top of the stairway , '' - i was sure i felt my heart beat for the first time in a century , ara . \\n▁ i mean , every time i look at you , i think you 're the most beautiful girl in the world but , tonight , even you ' ve outdone yourself . '' \\n▁ i blinked back the tiny pool of tears around my lashes . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , jase . '' \\n▁ his lips pressed firmly into my head again . \\n▁ ` ` you 're xxunk - '' ` ` break it up , you two , '' david snapped , drawing us suddenly apart . \\n▁ ` ` david ! '' \\n▁ i shrieked , looking around to see if anyone noticed . \\n▁ only a few people looked up , but politely went about their own business . \\n▁ ` ` you both know the rules . '' \\n▁ ` ` rules ? '' \\n▁ jase asked . \\n▁ ` ` you two are not allowed contact . '' \\n▁ ` ` who says ? '' \\n▁ jason stepped between david and i a bit . \\n▁ ` ` i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` you have no say who she - '' ` ` david , jason is one of my council members now . \\n▁ we can dance if we want . '' \\n▁ i went to step into jason again , but david grabbed my wrist , yanking it away . \\n▁ ` ` that 's it , you 're coming with me . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , let go of me . '' \\n▁ i tugged against him . \\n▁ ` ` stop wriggling . \\n▁ you 're making a scene . '' \\n▁ ` ` you are the one making a scene , brother , '' jason said , blocking his path . \\n▁ ` ` you have no right to order her around this way . '' \\n▁ ` ` no right ? '' \\n▁ david asked in a high tone . \\n▁ ` ` i am her husband . \\n▁ i have every right . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ jason moved closer , lowering his voice so it came as just a whisper through his teeth . \\n▁ ` ` you left her . \\n▁ you are bound only by a contract that states she is queen and you are king . \\n▁ nothing else . '' \\n▁ ` ` precisely . '' \\n▁ david shoved past him , dragging me along again . \\n▁ ` ` i have every legal right to do with her what i see fit . '' \\n▁ ` ` if you touch her , i 'll - '' ` ` go ahead , brother . '' \\n▁ david spun around , warding jason off with an icy gaze . \\n▁ ` ` hit me . \\n▁ give me a reason to arrest you . '' \\n▁ ` ` jason , '' arthur called , sending a very stern gaze across the crowd and into jason 's intentions , altering them . \\n▁ jase did n't move or shift in any way , but something in his eyes said he 'd backed down . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i did n't think you 'd have the guts , '' david said , and led me away . \\n▁ i stumbled along , checking over my shoulder , but jason was gone . \\n▁ ` ` we were just dancing , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` to dance , one does not need to kiss . '' \\n▁ ` ` you were watching us ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i noticed , '' he said dully and shoved me into a chair in the corner under the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a difference . '' \\n▁ i landed hard , my teeth clucking as the chair slid an inch and hit the wall . \\n▁ no one looked up . \\n▁ no one even noticed . \\n▁ or maybe no one really cared . \\n▁ ` ` you will stay here for the remainder of the evening , ara , unless i say otherwise . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' ` ` i said sit . '' \\n▁ he forced me down again by aim of that stern , pointed finger . \\n▁ it made no physical contact , but i was n't willing to challenge it . \\n▁ ` ` i want you where i can keep an eye on you . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't make me sit here . '' \\n▁ ` ` i can , and i am . \\n▁ i will not have you making a slut of yourself in front of all these people . \\n▁ now sit here and behave . '' \\n▁ he turned away , dusting his hands off , and i heard the tail end of some smart remark about disciplining his wife , shrinking into myself when everyone nearby laughed . \\n▁ they waited until he walked away before casting their judging eyes on me , sending shrink rays onto the surface of my body . \\n▁ i turned in my seat , hunching over a little . \\n▁ i did n't care if my posture slacked or if i looked less than noble . \\n▁ i just wanted to hide in the darkest corner i could find . \\n▁ ` ` would this pretty little girl in her party dress care to dance ? '' \\n▁ i looked up to arthur 's kind , smiling eyes . \\n▁ ` ` arthur , i ca n't . \\n▁ david said i have to stay here . '' \\n▁ he drew my hand toward him anyway , helping me stand . \\n▁ ` ` let 's see him challenge his old uncle , xxunk . '' \\n▁ i smiled , but it was n't arthur david would challenge ; it was me . \\n▁ except , i knew he 'd wait until we were alone . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m trying not to make him mad right now . \\n▁ he needs time to - '' ` ` he can have all the time he needs to heal , amara . '' \\n▁ he drew me closer , positioning our arms in an elegant sweep outward . \\n▁ ` ` but he does not need to hurt you and degrade you in the process . \\n▁ now - '' we moved away and stepped onto the dance floor . \\n▁ ` ` let us dance . '' \\n▁ as we circled the room , couples dancing nearby bowed their heads , stepping in wider circles to give us room , as if i were some kind of royal entity or something . \\n▁ i smiled up at arthur , so grateful he 'd come along when he did . \\n▁ i would n't challenge david in a room full of people : he 'd only make more of an effort to hold strong and put me in my place , and that would just create a massive scene , degrading david 's pride even more in the process and hindering any hope i had of sorting things out with him . \\n▁ but arthur , i could tell , was more than up for that challenge . \\n▁ except , david would n't dare challenge his uncle . \\n▁ i wondered what it was about him that the boys feared and respected so much . \\n▁ ` ` ow . '' \\n▁ arthur laughed , looking down at his foot . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . \\n▁ i ' m so sorry , arthur . '' \\n▁ i smiled sheepishly . \\n▁ ` ` never mind , my dear . \\n▁ i imagine your centre of gravity has shifted slightly with the being you now grow inside you . '' \\n▁ i looked down at the gap between arthur and i where our bodies remained apart because of my bump . \\n▁ ` ` no , it 's just that i ca n't really concentrate on the steps tonight . '' \\n▁ i glanced over my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i can feel david 's eyes on me . '' \\n▁ arthur 's lips and brow crinkled as he looked over at his nephew , and the feeling , the energy of david , faded . \\n▁ ` ` did he look away ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he did . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i said , exhaling the breath i did n't know i was holding . \\n▁ ` ` i will talk to him about this , amara . \\n▁ it wo n't go xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` what wo n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` his behaviour toward you tonight . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was n't that bad . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` it was . \\n▁ he was cruel , amara . \\n▁ and i ' ve heard several people mutter the same thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` you did ? '' \\n▁ he nodded , tilting his head then as if listening to something . \\n▁ ` ` if you can spare a moment , jason wants to see you . '' \\n▁ ` ` he does ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's waiting for you on the balcony . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , i … i ca n't . \\n▁ david will have him arrested if we keep seeing each other . '' \\n▁ ` ` worry not , my dear . \\n▁ i 'll distract david . \\n▁ you need to hear what jason has to say . '' \\n▁ we circled the dance floor again , my feet finally obeying my brain , but i stayed quiet , wondering what jason wanted . \\n▁ when we reached to doors to the balcony , arthur made a cheeky turn and swept us out of the room , twirling me straight into jason 's arms . \\n▁ ` ` all my prayers answered in one twirl , '' jase said , both arms gently wrapping me up . \\n▁ i stood on my toes for a second and touched my nose to his . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry about what happened before . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't apologise for anything , ara . '' \\n▁ he kissed my nose . \\n▁ ` ` david was the jerk . '' \\n▁ my heels touched the ground again and i turned to thank arthur , but he was gone . \\n▁ ` ` where 'd he - '' ` ` he 's playing distraction with the king . '' \\n▁ ` ` how will he keep him away ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't you worry your pretty little head about that . '' \\n▁ he tucked a curl behind my ear . \\n▁ ` ` i need to talk to you about something . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i can protect you , '' he said , his eyes round and so dark with hope . \\n▁ ` ` i could have legal right to step in when he 's mistreating you . '' \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` marry me . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` jase - '' ` ` ara , the queen is allowed more than one husband . \\n▁ make me your second . \\n▁ let me protect you , love you , be there every time you 're hurt or sick . '' \\n▁ ` ` you are now . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i get shut out - told i have no right to comfort you or make decisions for you . \\n▁ i am the one person here who cares more about you than myself , and i - '' ` ` jase , i know , okay , '' i cut in , pressing my hand flat to his chest . \\n▁ ` ` but i ' m not marrying you just so you can be my bodyguard . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you think that 's the only reason i ' m asking you ? '' \\n▁ my smile copied his . \\n▁ ` ` ara , that 's my convincing argument to make you say yes . '' \\n▁ i laughed through my nose again , wiping under it after . \\n▁ ` ` see , i love you even if you snot on yourself every time you laugh . '' \\n▁ this time i blew the laughter out through my lips , and stepped into him , slowly sliding both arms along his waist . \\n▁ ` ` i said i did n't want to love you , jase , because i needed to make a decision . \\n▁ i needed to choose and commit to one guy , for once in my life . \\n▁ and i know it 's too late for david and i , but this is my commitment , whether he wants me or not . \\n▁ i wo n't marry another while he 's still breathing , even if i legally can have two husbands . '' \\n▁ ` ` i understand that . '' \\n▁ ` ` see , i do n't think you do . \\n▁ i think you know that you and i make a much better couple and that you 're better for me in so many ways but , jase - '' i looked through the doors at david , distracted by a group of lower house members . \\n▁ ` ` you have so much heart and you 're so easy to love . \\n▁ and , david … he 's got a darker side that i worry for - that i do n't think anybody else in this world understands . \\n▁ i just feel like … '' i looked at jase again , moving my shoulders up once . \\n▁ ` ` if i do n't love him , who will ? '' \\n▁ jase let out a hot breath across the night sky and twirled me gracefully into his arms , cradling my spine to his chest , both of us just watching the candlelight from inside flicker shadows around the garden below us . \\n▁ ` ` you 're going to be okay , you know . '' \\n▁ ` ` how do you know ? '' \\n▁ he pressed his lips to the top of my head , his warm breath making me hold mine . \\n▁ ` ` because i ' m going to make sure of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` and how will you do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` one day , things will be different for us , ara . \\n▁ i believe that somewhere out there under those stars is a future for us , and maybe it 's decades away into eternity , but i love you . \\n▁ i ' ve loved you under the most insane conditions , and i wo n't ever give up hope for us . '' \\n▁ he turned me to face him again . \\n▁ ` ` things are going to get worse before they get better , but i ' m here , and i just need you to know that you 'll always have a home to come to in my heart , ara . \\n▁ it belongs to you eternally . '' \\n▁ he touched his chest . \\n▁ ` ` just hold onto that when things get dark . '' \\n▁ i nodded , standing on my toes as he pressed his lips to my head . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a good man , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i ' m the man who destroyed my brother . \\n▁ i ' m not good , but i love you , and i 'd die for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` what is the meaning of this ? '' \\n▁ david roared , thrusting both doors open at once . \\n▁ we broke apart , jason tucking me safely behind him . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not her fault , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't care whose fault it is . \\n▁ she is to come inside at once . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 're just talking . \\n▁ she - '' ` ` do not test the lengths i will go to to keep you and her apart , brother . \\n▁ i will - '' ` ` it 's okay . '' \\n▁ i patted jason 's arm , stepping out from the shadows . \\n▁ the moonlight moved up from the ground , over my dress and lit my face , and the anger in david slowly simmered down . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll go inside now . '' \\n▁ ` ` you will do no such thing . '' \\n▁ david rushed forward and grabbed my arm . \\n▁ ` ` you 're to go to bed . \\n▁ now . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i ' m not tired . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't care . '' \\n▁ i tried to twist my wrist from his grip , searching everywhere for one of my guard . \\n▁ but they were all distracted - even falcon . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't make me go if i do n't want to . '' \\n▁ ` ` try me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . '' \\n▁ i studied my feet . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll tell arthur . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what 's he going to do about it ? '' \\n▁ i looked david right in the eye this time , pursing my lips , then said , ` ` try him . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on here ? '' \\n▁ falcon cut in , wrapping my hips and drawing me away from david . \\n▁ but david would n't let go . \\n▁ in one tug , he yanked me back onto his side of the line . \\n▁ falcon 's hand fell onto the sword in his own belt . \\n▁ ` ` where are you taking her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to bed , '' david said coldly , then motioned to the guards by the door . \\n▁ ` ` see that my brother makes it back to his room , and stays there . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , majesty . '' \\n▁ they bowed , and the jig was up . \\n▁ ` ` forget it , ara , '' jason said with a dismissive headshake . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not worth it . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ jase was right . \\n▁ we could sort this mess out tomorrow . \\n▁ now was n't the time . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , falcon . \\n▁ i ' m just gon na go to bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you have n't even eaten yet , you 'll - '' ` ` she can grab an apple on the way out . '' \\n▁ david turned and dragged me along behind him , snatching a red , shiny piece of fruit from a bowl as we hurried out the doors by the fireplace , the painted lilith looking down on me like she found it all so amusing . \\n▁ ` ` what are you smiling at ? '' \\n▁ i asked her spitefully . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` i do n't like having to treat you like a child , ara , '' david said , pulling me up the stairs by my wrist . \\n▁ ` ` but you ca n't expect me to stand by and let you xxunk with the very man who ruined your marriage . '' \\n▁ ` ` he did n't ruin it , david . \\n▁ i did . '' \\n▁ david stopped walking and looked back down at me . \\n▁ the music lilting out from the doors of the great hall just in front of us carried all the joy and excitement of those still allowed in the room . \\n▁ i felt cold and empty and left out from where i stood now . \\n▁ ` ` it takes two to tango , '' he said coldly . \\n▁ ` ` yes , but his reasons for ` ` dancing '' in the first place were n't the same as mine . '' \\n▁ his brow slowly creased in the middle and he moved down a step so our eyes aligned . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ i tried to wriggle free from his grip , but it tightened . \\n▁ ` ` he wanted me to carry his child . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he asked , his voice cracking with confusion . \\n▁ ` ` because then he could use the dagger and kill drake , and i would never have had to lose you . '' \\n▁ his grasp on my wrist loosened , but did n't drop . \\n▁ ` ` but the law does n't work that way . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ but we did n't know that at the time , and - '' ` ` that 's what he tried to tell me - that day in eve 's room , was n't it ? '' \\n▁ he stepped closer , grabbing my other wrist , the apple tucked between his pinkie and his ring finger . \\n▁ ` ` ara , that 's what he wanted to say . \\n▁ he - '' ` ` he realised then that he 'd made a mistake . \\n▁ that even if he had got me pregnant , it still would n't have saved you . '' \\n▁ he dropped both my wrists and took a step back , turning away with the back of his hand over his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` but … he 's in love with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ that 's why he chose to die and leave me with the only man i wanted . '' \\n▁ he looked at me then , but the hatred was still fierce in his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` and what about you ? \\n▁ you said you that your reasons for sleeping with him were different to his . \\n▁ what - '' ` ` i wo n't lie . '' \\n▁ i clutched the edges of my dress , looking down . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve lied enough to you , david . \\n▁ and - '' ` ` look at me when you speak , '' he said , thrusting my chin up . \\n▁ our eyes met and mine filled with tears , not ready to see him break all over again . \\n▁ ` ` the truth is , i laid with him because i wanted to save you . \\n▁ but at some point in … in that time , i realised i loved him too much to lose to him . \\n▁ and - '' he sighed and stepped away again . \\n▁ ` ` and then , i decided that i did n't want to love him . \\n▁ and i was angry at myself for feeling anything for him . \\n▁ i thought - '' ` ` just stop . '' \\n▁ he put his hand up . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't hear any more of this . '' \\n▁ ` ` you need to know the truth , though , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know the truth , '' he yelled . \\n▁ ` ` you love him . \\n▁ and that 's all there is to know . '' \\n▁ he grabbed my arm again and spun me on the spot , leading me up the stairs faster than before . \\n▁ i tripped on the front of my dress , stumbling a little as my shoe slipped off my foot and fell a few steps down . \\n▁ david did n't notice , though , or he did n't care . \\n▁ he just dragged me along , tossing the apple he was carrying in the first plant he saw . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve taken everything away from me , ara , '' he said as we reached the third floor corridor . \\n▁ ` ` i have no reason to live now , and no reason to die . \\n▁ the dagger is gone . \\n▁ my wife is gone , and i ' m nothing but a king without a purpose . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , at least you 're still king , '' i said spitefully . \\n▁ ` ` you think that 's all that matters to me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it seems to be . '' \\n▁ i folded my arms as we stopped by my bedroom door . \\n▁ ` ` it was always your greatest dream . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara . \\n▁ you . \\n▁ were . \\n▁ my . \\n▁ only dream . '' \\n▁ he laughed incredulously , looking off to one side for a second . \\n▁ ` ` you just never understood that . '' \\n▁ ` ` yet you ' ve done everything to prove so far that that 's a lie , david . '' \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` like the way you treat me , and how much you hate me for telling you the truth . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't hate you for telling the truth , ara . \\n▁ i hate you for sleeping with my brother , '' he said , leaning in so his face was right in front of mine . \\n▁ ` ` and , as far as i ' m concerned , i may have little reason left to live , but i ' ve even less reason to let you or my brother live . \\n▁ i just ca n't do it . \\n▁ i ca n't rule this monarchy if i have to look at you every day . '' \\n▁ he opened my door and shoved me inside . \\n▁ ` ` you need to stay in here until i decide what to do with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , wait . '' \\n▁ i ran forward before he could close the door . \\n▁ and i wanted to argue or plead with him , but his eyes had gone completely black , like he was n't even alive in there anymore - as if the vampire had stepped up to save his heart from the complication of feeling , and completely wiped my david away in the process . \\n▁ i took a humble step backward and spoke to the floor . \\n▁ ` ` i … i ca n't get this dress off by myself . \\n▁ can you send - '' ` ` you can sleep in it , '' he barked and slammed the door shut in my face . \\n▁ i heard the keys rattle in the lock , and when i tried the handle a second later , it would n't turn . \\n▁ but my stomach did . \\n▁ i laid my hand over it , waiting for the quivering to stop . \\n▁ i could ' ve ended it . \\n▁ i could ' ve lied and told david the only reason i slept with jase was to save his life - that i did n't love jason anywhere in my heart . \\n▁ but we 'd founded our love on lies from the beginning : the truth i carried back then for loving mike . \\n▁ the truth he carried for the man and the creature he was that he would never show me . \\n▁ one lie after another had come between us , and i just could n't look him in the eye and tell him i did n't , and that i never loved jase . \\n▁ i did n't want to love him , but what did that mean , really ? \\n▁ it was stupid and it could n't be classed as a real emotion in any way , shape , or form . \\n▁ but it was how i felt . \\n▁ i loved both of them equally once , and my love for david grew beyond what i felt for jase . \\n▁ only , now , david was killing that love off just a little bit every day . \\n▁ i knew he was hurt . \\n▁ i knew he needed time to deal with how he was feeling , but a part of me wondered if maybe this was just it - this was how it would be forever now . \\n▁ how little could he have loved me before if he was n't willing to at least try to forgive me ? \\n▁ then again , how little could i ever have loved him to expect that ? \\n▁ all i could hope for now was a quick and painless death for jason . \\n▁ i did n't even have a hope that i might join him one day , because as soon as my baby turned eighteen , i 'd be killed , and my soul would belong to lilith again . \\n▁ and the fact that i knew , so deep it was almost a part of me , that david would find comfort in my death made the heaving in my gut quicken . \\n▁ a blast of vomit spilled into my fingertips , landing in the toilet only by the pure miracle of the vampire speed i used to get to the bathroom . \\n▁ i sobbed as hard as i vomited , my stomach churning and burning like a hole was being ripped open inside me . \\n▁ ` ` shh , '' said a quiet voice , and my hair moved back off my face under soft fingertips . \\n▁ ` ` just breathe , sweet girl . \\n▁ do n't cry . '' \\n▁ ` ` jase ? '' \\n▁ i coughed and spat into the toilet again , wiping my hand along my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` just breathe . '' \\n▁ his smiling face was there waiting for me when i turned around . \\n▁ ` ` how did you get in here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` went out the window , '' he said casually , a half smile turning one corner of his lip . \\n▁ i stood up just a little , still cramped and sore . \\n▁ ` ` you could get in big trouble , you know ? '' \\n▁ he just nodded and said , ` ` i know , '' then handed me a xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` thank you . '' \\n▁ i blotted the smudged mascara from under my eyes first , then wiped my mouth clean . \\n▁ ` ` come on then . '' \\n▁ he spun me at the shoulders so i faced the mirror on the wall above the sink . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get this dress off you . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you know how to undo it ? '' \\n▁ he stopped for a second and leaned forward to whisper in my ear . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve undone my fair share of corsets , ara . '' \\n▁ i laughed timidly , reaching down to hold the counter top . \\n▁ pull by pull , the corset came loose and my lungs expanded , revelling in the simplest form of freedom . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a lifesaver , jase . '' \\n▁ his arm circled my waist , a flat hand holding the front of my dress to my ribs as he turned me slowly to face him , pressing a very warm , very sweet kiss to my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry about what happened tonight . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes and moved my face along his lips , feeling them brush so softly over my skin that it tingled . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be sorry , jase . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i am all the same . \\n▁ he should n't treat you like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ i snuggled into his chest , holding my breath as his warm hands cupped my spine and the dress fell downward , held there by my hips , leaving my bare br * * sts against jason 's shirt . \\n▁ ` ` i tried to defend myself against him , but he 's so … '' ` ` forceful . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` well , he does n't own you . '' \\n▁ he smoothed his hand down my waist and pushed the dress away , helping me step out of it . \\n▁ ` ` if he keeps this up , i 'll kidnap you , and he 'll never see you again . \\n▁ i swear it on my mother 's grave . '' \\n▁ i laughed , tossing the dress off to the side . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd kinda like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ jase pulled me closer by my bare hips . \\n▁ ` ` because i ' ve made plans , ara . \\n▁ all you have to do is say the word , and we 'll be gone so fast they wo n't realise it until we 're in another country . '' \\n▁ i thought long and hard in that few seconds as i laid my cheek to his chest and let out a breath . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't run from my problems . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course you can . '' \\n▁ he laughed , tangling his fingers in my hair and sliding a few pins out so it all dropped loosely down my back . \\n▁ ` ` but , let 's just get some clothes on you and get you to bed for now . \\n▁ we 'll talk more about it when you 're ready . '' \\n▁ ` ` that sounds good , '' i said , but instead of moving away , i slowly lifted one arm , then the other , up to his neck and wrapped them tightly around him , angling my head so my crown would n't chill his jaw . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , jase . \\n▁ i really needed someone just now . '' \\n▁ he squeezed me a little tighter , breathing me in deeply . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ xxrep 3 * the song of summer birds was gone when i opened my eyes , having retreated with the day that began before this one . \\n▁ only rain owned these skies now , leaving a very clear , very stern warning that winter was on its way . \\n▁ i 'd never seen the snow at the manor , but people had told me there was nothing like it in all the world . \\n▁ i flattened my covers to the bed beside me , wishing i could reach across and hold jason 's hand . \\n▁ he stayed only long enough for me to drift away last night , then disappeared out the window , leaving me safely tucked up in bed . \\n▁ i could sense falcon nearby , despite the hour being too early for him to be on duty . \\n▁ i wanted to rap on my door and ask if david had unlocked it , but i was n't really sure i wanted to know . \\n▁ the mother of nature called to me from the forest outside , her angelic voice a whispering patter among the rain . \\n▁ she wanted to see me , needed to see me . \\n▁ but unless i jumped from the balcony , i would remain a princess in a tower , guarded by a dragon , for who knew how long . \\n▁ or maybe not as long as i thought … the door latch clicked then and i drew the sheets to my chest , sitting up a little as it swung open and david ushered the butler in . \\n▁ ` ` morning , my queen . '' \\n▁ the old man bowed , placing a tray at my feet . \\n▁ ` ` morning , edgar . '' \\n▁ he smiled again and turned , leaving the room quickly . \\n▁ ` ` david , '' i called before he shut the door . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're not planning to lock me in here again , are you ? '' \\n▁ he looked at the door handle , then at me . \\n▁ ` ` from this day on , you will eat in private quarters . \\n▁ you may leave your room for council and court sessions only and , for anything else , you will need my approval . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're imprisoning me ! '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m keeping you out of my sight so i do n't kill you and , in turn , the child you 're carrying . '' \\n▁ ` ` david ? '' \\n▁ he sighed , opening the door again . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i made a mistake , but i do n't deserve to die for it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i disagree . '' \\n▁ ` ` look , if you wanted to punish me , it 's working . \\n▁ i feel like hell inside , okay ? '' \\n▁ i motioned to my tight chest . \\n▁ ` ` it feels like you ' ve ripped every part of my beating heart out and put it in a blender . \\n▁ but i ' m a living being , and i can only take so much . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , what ? \\n▁ because i do n't have a heartbeat , that means you can do whatever you want to hurt m - '' ` ` that 's not what i ' m saying . '' \\n▁ i pushed the covers back and sat up on my knees , holding the ' i am queen ; now do as i say ' card back for if really needed . \\n▁ ` ` i … i know you hate me . \\n▁ you have every right to . \\n▁ but please do n't lock me away . \\n▁ i 'll stay out of sight , i swear . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` wait , how did you get your dress off ? '' \\n▁ i looked around the room . \\n▁ ` ` i … i ripped it . '' \\n▁ he frowned . \\n▁ ` ` it was too tight , '' i lied , shrugging innocently . \\n▁ he just groaned and backed away , leaving the door open . \\n▁ i was n't sure if that meant i could come out , but i even if it did n't , i was n't staying in here any longer . \\n▁ i grabbed my red velvet cloak from the closet , undressed , and darted from the room . \\n▁ there was only one place on this earth i was safe from the wrath of david 's broken heart , no matter what , and if he wanted me gone , invisible , then that 's where i planned to stay - at least for the rest of the day . \\n▁ the mother offered comfort as i cried my eyes out , lying naked , curled in a ball at the base of the stone , my bloody hand against it . \\n▁ the forest swarmed around me , birds and small animals showing themselves , forming a protective barrier between me and the rest of the world . \\n▁ i knew the depth of my agony was multiplied by a million hormones my body did n't understand , but that did n't make the pain any less real . \\n▁ ` ` what do i do , mother ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i already gave you the answer . '' \\n▁ ` ` when ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when you came to us and asked the question . '' \\n▁ ` ` the question ? '' \\n▁ i thought about it for a second , scraping a few leaves off my cheek to stop the slight itch there . \\n▁ ` ` do you mean when you said jason was the answer ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ i pictured that day - his smile - the way he broke when i said i would never be with him . \\n▁ ` ` how is he the answer ? '' \\n▁ ` ` finally , '' she said , appearing atop the stone in the elegant form of her mortal self . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve asked the right question . '' \\n▁ i sat up , drawing my bloodied hand away from the stone and tucking it in my lap . \\n▁ the dirt and leaves shifted under me , cushioning my bare bottom , while the rich scent of soil grounded my floating heart . \\n▁ ` ` then tell me . \\n▁ just tell me what i ' m supposed to do . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're supposed to follow your heart . '' \\n▁ ` ` my heart still wants david . '' \\n▁ she smiled , her blue eyes , so like mine , shining bright with the life of the forest . \\n▁ ` ` you are destined to be with jason , xxunk . \\n▁ it has been written now for some time . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , standing up quickly . \\n▁ ` ` i love him . \\n▁ i ca n't help but to love him . \\n▁ he 's amazing and kind and sweet , but it 's not right . '' \\n▁ she just nodded , her thin smile offering me no alternative . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll kill david . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` it will save him . '' \\n▁ ` ` how so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when the time comes , the love you offer that boy - that sweet jason - will give him the strength and courage to save you all . '' \\n▁ ` ` save us ? '' \\n▁ her head moved down , then up , slowly . \\n▁ ` ` so … i have to love him to save david . '' \\n▁ i frowned , looking down at the stone . \\n▁ ` ` that does n't make any sense . '' \\n▁ ` ` very little does in life before we cross the line of fate and see everything for the lesson or important event it always was . \\n▁ even the tiniest setback in life can often be for the greatest benefit . '' \\n▁ ` ` but it is to our benefit - to be with jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to the benefit of all . '' \\n▁ her form wavered a little as the cut in my hand healed over and the blood on the stone faded . \\n▁ ` ` but … wait . '' \\n▁ i tried to touch her to bring her back . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not ready to let go of david yet . '' \\n▁ ` ` then talk with him , '' she said , becoming an echo and nothing more than a flickering fog . \\n▁ ` ` he will help you cross sides . '' \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` talk with him . \\n▁ you will be surer of your path every time you hear him speak . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' i stopped when my words fell on an empty forest . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to lose him , '' i muttered to myself . \\n▁ i did n't want this path . \\n▁ i loved jason because he was hard not to love . \\n▁ but i loved david no matter what , even when i hated him . \\n▁ why would the mother of life ask me to throw that away ? \\n▁ i spent the better part of the day pacing the halls , thinking about my walk in the forest . \\n▁ when i passed walt near the great hall and he said david had gone into town , i took the perfect opportunity to go and visit with jase , who still had n't come out of his room . \\n▁ he had n't been locked in , like me , but he was keeping a low profile . \\n▁ ` ` hoping to find something different to the last few hundred times you ' ve read that ? '' \\n▁ i asked , leaning on the doorframe . \\n▁ jase sat up and tucked my suicide letter under his thigh . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't hear you come in . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , that 's because i did n't knock first . '' \\n▁ i pushed up from my lean and wandered into his room . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to knock , ara . \\n▁ you 're welcome in here any time . '' \\n▁ i smiled and sat down on the foot of the bed . \\n▁ ` ` so , why are you still reading that letter ? '' \\n▁ he drew it out from under his leg and flattened the page . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m trying to understand something . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why you said , and i quote , ' i love you , jase . \\n▁ i ' ve loved you for so long and , in a different life , we would have been married , had a family , and lived together forever . ' '' \\n▁ he looked up from the letter . \\n▁ ` ` how can you feel that and then , the minute you 're free from david , deny me the chance to be with you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` jase . '' \\n▁ i sighed , flopping back on the bed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not free . \\n▁ i told you . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` you 're committing to him even if he does n't want you , '' he said in a mock girl 's voice . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i remember all too clearly . \\n▁ but why ? \\n▁ i do n't understand why , after everything he 's done - the way he 's treated you , you ca n't see that he 's not going to come ` round , ara . '' \\n▁ i thought about it for a second . \\n▁ ` ` forgiveness takes time . '' \\n▁ jase laughed . \\n▁ ` ` ara , david and i are still fighting over who broke the bottle of port in uncle arthur 's study sixty years ago . '' \\n▁ i laughed too . \\n▁ ` ` he can hold a grudge for hundreds of years - especially against a girl he let into his heart . \\n▁ he 's feeling exposed and damaged in ways even he does n't understand and , ara , if he was capable of forgiveness … '' ` ` it would be decades away . \\n▁ i know . '' \\n▁ jase huffed , and i heard the drawer in his nightstand close , his shadow coming over my face a second later . \\n▁ i looked up into his smiling green eyes . \\n▁ ` ` if he … '' he juggled the words in the back of his throat . \\n▁ ` ` he can be mean , ara . \\n▁ if he wants you to hurt , you can be damn sure you 're going to hurt . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' i said positively . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be okay . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but … eventually he 'll do or say something to hurt you beyond repair . \\n▁ and i do n't want this to happen , ara , but i have no control over it . \\n▁ just - '' he sat back , and i rolled onto my side to watch him . \\n▁ ` ` if the day ever comes where you decide you do n't want his forgiveness anymore , do you think you 'd - '' ` ` i promise . '' \\n▁ i reached across and cupped his hand . \\n▁ ` ` promise what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i promise i 'll marry you then . '' \\n▁ his face split into a wide , pearly grin . \\n▁ he looked up from our hands , making me smile too . \\n▁ ` ` i will hold you to that promise . '' \\n▁ ` ` you wo n't need to . \\n▁ if i believe things are truly over for david and i , i would n't hesitate to marry you , jase . \\n▁ and it 'd take hell to stop me . '' \\n▁ ` ` then - '' he kissed my hand . \\n▁ ` ` until that day , i pray you fall out of love with him , but i hope it 's not for the cruelty he shows you . \\n▁ i do n't want you to suffer that way . '' \\n▁ i flopped onto my back and stared up at the ceiling , softly rubbing my belly . \\n▁ then , quietly , without warning , the vampire beside me placed his hand over mine . \\n▁ it felt warm and safe and so comfortable i moved my own hand away and let him feel the baby inside me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m gon na take care of her , ara . \\n▁ she 'll never want for love a day in her life . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , you 'd be willing to take on a kid that 's not yours ? '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , she is a part of you , and that makes her a part of me . \\n▁ as far as i ' m concerned , she is of my own flesh and blood . '' \\n▁ i pouted , half smiling . \\n▁ ` ` sometimes , i wish she was yours . '' \\n▁ he leaned down and kissed my belly , hovering there for a few seconds after . \\n▁ ` ` me too . '' \\n▁ my gaze left his lips and the soft skin of my belly under them , and moved onto the side of his face . \\n▁ so much had happened between us . \\n▁ his face was one i used to fear and yet , now , it was the one i looked for when everything was falling apart . \\n▁ i slid my thumb down his cheekbone , thinking back to the day i confessed our affair - how i found him bruised and beaten in the cellblock . \\n▁ ` ` hey , jase ? '' \\n▁ ` ` mm ? '' \\n▁ ` ` who hurt you the day david had you arrested ? '' \\n▁ he looked up , his smile blending with a frown . \\n▁ ` ` he did n't tell you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` who did n't tell me what ? '' \\n▁ he laughed , sitting back . \\n▁ ` ` falcon . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i sat up . \\n▁ ` ` he did it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he … he was pretty pissed off . \\n▁ as soon as david left you alone in your room , falcon came down and made sure i paid dearly for every inch of flesh i ever touched on you . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , jase . '' \\n▁ i touched his hand . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know . \\n▁ i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay . \\n▁ i kinda deserved it . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you did n't . \\n▁ and why did n't you tell me who did it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , ara , i was n't gon na do that , '' he said simply . \\n▁ ` ` you love falcon . \\n▁ i did n't wan na upset you . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i am upset . \\n▁ i ca n't believe he 'd - '' ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ he said smugly . \\n▁ ` ` you really ca n't believe he 'd do that ? '' \\n▁ i bit my lip , huffing my hair off my brow . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i can believe he 'd beat you senseless . \\n▁ but it 's not like him to take the law into his own hands . '' \\n▁ ` ` he was n't really thinking then , ara . \\n▁ you might say he was blind with rage . '' \\n▁ ` ` wait . '' \\n▁ i grabbed jase 's forearm . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not bound by the curse of lilith , is he ? \\n▁ like blade was - '' ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he shook his head , smiling . \\n▁ ` ` he just cares about you and wanted to deck the guy who ruined your life . '' \\n▁ i relaxed a bit then . \\n▁ ` ` like a big brother ? '' \\n▁ ` ` exactly . \\n▁ come here - '' jase reached out and tugged my sleeve until i crawled over and laid between his legs , my spine to his chest , his back leaned against the bedpost . \\n▁ ` ` do n't tell him you know . \\n▁ just let him have this one , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , okay then . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i just ca n't make sense of it , though . '' \\n▁ ` ` of what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i really adore falcon , but the curse of lilith is supposed to befall any man with a heartbeat who is unlucky enough to be cared for by me - '' ` ` unless they ' ve been in , or are , in true love with someone else . '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but - '' ` ` falcon 's been in love before , '' he stated . \\n▁ ` ` he has ? '' \\n▁ jase nodded once against the side of my face . \\n▁ ` ` i read all of his thoughts - past and present - when he was laying in to me . \\n▁ he lost his fiance , felicity , a few years back . '' \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` car accident . '' \\n▁ ` ` serious ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ he called her over to help him sort out an argument with his sister , annie . \\n▁ but she stormed off in a hurry before felicity got there , did n't even check the road before crossing it . \\n▁ she hit felicity 's windshield and the car swerved into oncoming traffic … '' his lips pursed into a thin line . \\n▁ ` ` felicity got just the smallest knock to the head , but she died in hospital shortly after annie . '' \\n▁ the scene played out in my head , probably pictured all wrong , but the grief that came with it was unmistakeable . \\n▁ ` ` what was their fight about ? '' \\n▁ his closed lips angled up on the edges into a smile . \\n▁ ` ` she 'd been with a boy falcon did n't approve of and … she got pregnant . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes for a second . \\n▁ ` ` that 's just so tragic . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` so , go easy on him . \\n▁ in a lot of ways , what he did to me was n't just for you - it was for annie , too . '' \\n▁ i angled my head and kissed the side of his jaw . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry he did that . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , you just made it all worth it . '' \\n▁ i laughed and lay my hands on his where he rested them over my belly . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * despite david hating his brother , thankfully , he had n't revoked his approval for the lab . \\n▁ jase was ordering parts and pieces , and i was supposed to meet him in the field to demonstrate my new rock - blasting tricks at their best . \\n▁ but as i walked into the great hall , the round , shiny surface of a golden apple caught my eye , just sitting there on the dining table for anyone to find . \\n▁ ` ` how did you get out here ? '' \\n▁ i asked the apple , walking over . \\n▁ ` ` i put it there , '' eve said , flickering and waving suddenly in front of me like smoke . \\n▁ ` ` why , eve ? \\n▁ someone might see it . \\n▁ what are you playing at ? '' \\n▁ ` ` needed to get your attention . \\n▁ you do n't see me so much anymore when i ' m in the room . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't ? '' \\n▁ she shook her small head . \\n▁ ` ` well , why did you need my attention ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i wanted you to see something , '' she whispered , then reached across and flicked the apple onto the floor . \\n▁ it hit with a mighty thud , leaving a small dent in the wood . \\n▁ ` ` really , eve , was that necessary ? '' \\n▁ i bent down to pick it up , and two pairs of feet came charging into the room from under the stairway . \\n▁ i stayed put for a second , hoping they 'd pass , otherwise it might look like i was hiding down here under the table , and i was n't about to show them the apple , either . \\n▁ ` ` emily . \\n▁ just - '' blade ran after her , spinning her around in one swift , knightly move . \\n▁ ` ` please do n't walk away from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you expect me to say , blade ? '' \\n▁ she cried . \\n▁ ` ` do n't say anything , '' he said , and that accent made me wish for a second that he was talking to me . \\n▁ ` ` em , just let me hold you . \\n▁ let me - '' ` ` there 's nothing you can do to make this better . \\n▁ do n't you get it ? \\n▁ it does n't matter what you feel for me . \\n▁ i ' m damaged goods ! '' \\n▁ ` ` aw , em . '' \\n▁ he rolled his head to one side . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` how can you say that ? \\n▁ how can you want me after what he just told you ? '' \\n▁ his shoulders dropped and he looked down at the ground , then off to one side . \\n▁ ` ` see ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ em . '' \\n▁ he grabbed her wrist . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't understand . \\n▁ i ' m not upset about that . \\n▁ i ' m upset because i do n't know how to make you see that none of that matters to me . '' \\n▁ she stopped trying to pull away from him and just stood there . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not … repulsed by me ? '' \\n▁ blade laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you could sleep with arthur and i would n't be repulsed by you . \\n▁ it 's gon na take a lot more than sex with that creep to keep me from you . \\n▁ and , besides - '' he braved another step closer . \\n▁ ` ` you were human then , and it was a long time ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` not for me , it was n't . \\n▁ it feels like only yesterday . '' \\n▁ she hugged herself , looking at her feet . \\n▁ blade wrapped both arms around her , his shoulders tense for the first few breaths until it became clear emily would n't push him away . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry he did that to you , em , '' he whispered into her hair . \\n▁ ` ` but he 's the fool . \\n▁ not you . '' \\n▁ and now i was very curious about what em had told him . \\n▁ ` ` mike could n't look at me after , '' she whimpered . \\n▁ ` ` he said he still loved me but he just needed time to make sense of it all . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ that boy needed to read relationships , for dummies . \\n▁ ` ` i know that makes you feel like he does n't care about you , but they were friends - close friends . \\n▁ and he 's had to come to terms with this new david he 's seen rise as king , and then with all of this . '' \\n▁ he squeezed her a bit tighter . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't blame you . \\n▁ and he did n't mean to tell me , either . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ she nodded against his chest . \\n▁ ` ` have you told ara ? '' \\n▁ her head moved in a no . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve never found the words . '' \\n▁ ` ` to tell me what ? '' \\n▁ i asked , standing up then to make my presence known . \\n▁ emily spun around in blade 's arms , her brown eyes going wide . \\n▁ ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` emily . '' \\n▁ i moved a bit closer , stepping cautiously . \\n▁ somehow , right now , i got the sense that i was the last person she wanted to see . \\n▁ ` ` what were you talking about ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you were listening ? '' \\n▁ she yelled , jerking forward . \\n▁ ` ` i was passing by , and i. . . '' \\n▁ i smirked at blade . \\n▁ ` ` i thought blade was finally confessing his love for you . \\n▁ i just wanted to listen . '' \\n▁ ` ` living vicariously through me now , huh ? '' \\n▁ she said sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` if you must know - '' i propped both hands on my hips , checking under the table quickly to see if the apple was hidden enough . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and i ' m sorry for that , but … i just wanted to see you happy . \\n▁ that 's all . '' \\n▁ her dead - straight spine relaxed again , and blade and i followed suit . \\n▁ ` ` so you knew he was in love with me , too ? '' \\n▁ she asked , jerking her head at blade . \\n▁ i could n't help but smile . \\n▁ she rolled her eyes , but i knew the action did n't fit the feeling . \\n▁ she was happy - happier than i 'd seen her in ages . \\n▁ ` ` so , what was it mike could n't handle , em ? \\n▁ why did you break up ? '' \\n▁ she sighed , looked at blade , then moved over and took my hand . \\n▁ ` ` i need to show you something . '' \\n▁ ` ` o … kay . '' \\n▁ i noticed her nervousness enough to check blade 's reaction , too . \\n▁ he was about as tense as a lamb in a field of wolves . \\n▁ emily ducked her head and lifted it again , sweeping her hair back off her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` look . '' \\n▁ ` ` i see a scar and - '' i looked a bit closer , and just above the little silver scar left from the day jase turned her was a tiny greenish - black dot - like a tattooed freckle . \\n▁ ` ` a mark ? '' \\n▁ she drew her hair back over her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` from … like what humans get when they have sex with a vampire ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` but … mike was your first and last . \\n▁ and he was lilithian by the time you guys had sex . \\n▁ and xxunk do n't leave - '' ` ` mike was not this poor girl 's first . '' \\n▁ blade exhaled his words . \\n▁ an invisible rug came out from under my feet . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? \\n▁ who was ? '' \\n▁ blade cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` your husband . '' \\n▁ a vacuum slowly sucked the air from the room , my mouth going completely dry . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ emily stepped forward , but i waved her off , walking blindly toward the glass doors . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ blade tried , too , his voice going straight to my inner message bank . \\n▁ david and emily . \\n▁ david and emily . \\n▁ he slept with her . \\n▁ he held her like he held me . \\n▁ his hands on her hips ; his lips touching hers ; his naked body completely wrapped up in hers . \\n▁ all the images of them dancing together at my house - emily in her green dress ; david , so tall and so handsome - came rushing back to haunt me , blending and mixing with my own images of david 's naked body , scattering everything i thought i knew and replacing it with her . \\n▁ and him . \\n▁ naked . \\n▁ together . \\n▁ the ground changed from wood floors to stone steps to long , xxunk grass under my feet , until i reached the sunny clearing and fell to my knees a few hundred feet from my oak tree , sinking my hands into the ground to hold myself up . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` emily , '' i said into the earth , watching another tear fall between my knees . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry you had to find out that way . '' \\n▁ her shadow darkened my hands as she stood over me . \\n▁ i sobbed a little harder . \\n▁ ` ` was there a better way to find out ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i guess not . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ jason 's arms wrapped my body and he swept me into his chest . \\n▁ ` ` damn it . \\n▁ do n't run off like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ he leaned out , wiping his thumbs down my tear - soaked face . \\n▁ ` ` i called to you several times . \\n▁ you just ignored me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't be sorry , ara . \\n▁ you just scared me , is all . '' \\n▁ i looked at emily then , and the pity in her eyes made it all hurt so much more . \\n▁ she knew . \\n▁ all along . \\n▁ she knew what it was like to be with my husband . \\n▁ she lied to me . \\n▁ he lied to me . \\n▁ why would they do that ? \\n▁ ` ` how did she find out ? '' \\n▁ jason asked emily in a very short , almost harsh tone . \\n▁ ` ` wait ! '' \\n▁ i pushed away from him , falling back in the grass on my palms . \\n▁ ` ` you knew ? '' \\n▁ ` ` only recently . '' \\n▁ he reached for me again . \\n▁ i moved away . \\n▁ ` ` how recent ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the day i turned em . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not really what i call recent . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ and i tried to tell you , but everything happened after that . \\n▁ then i was supposedly dead . \\n▁ and there has n't really been a good moment to break your heart like that with the news , ara . \\n▁ not to mention - '' he sat down on his butt with a huge sigh . \\n▁ ` ` david really should have been the one to tell you . '' \\n▁ i bit my lips and turned my gaze on em . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you tell me ? \\n▁ you could have told me from the first day we became friends , and it would ' ve been okay , emily . \\n▁ but you lied to me , you - '' ` ` she did n't lie , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` david erased it , '' jason said , offering emily his hand ; she took it and sat down across from him . \\n▁ ` ` emily did n't even know . '' \\n▁ ` ` you did n't know you slept with him ? '' \\n▁ i asked accusingly , drawing the rest of that spiteful attack back in since , continuing would make me a hypocrite . \\n▁ ` ` but you … '' ` ` she was a virgin , yes , '' jason answered the question i wanted to ask . \\n▁ ` ` then you were - '' ` ` bound to him . '' \\n▁ she nodded , resting her chin on her knee . \\n▁ ` ` i was obsessed with david , ara , believed it was love , but - '' ` ` then , how come you suddenly remembered ? \\n▁ or did david actually tell you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she did n't suddenly remember , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` when she came to me , the day i bit her , it … she was so upset . \\n▁ she was mad at me for what i did to you at the masquerade , but her anger went beyond caring for a friend . '' \\n▁ ` ` we got in a fight about how he left me , '' she added . \\n▁ ` ` and then the truth came out , '' jase said , ` ` that she never loved me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i told him i was always in love with david - that i used jason to get past that . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , jase . '' \\n▁ i cocked my head , eyes of sympathy offering him wordless condolences . \\n▁ ` ` i was okay . \\n▁ but it did n't make a whole lot of sense - for her to be in love with david . \\n▁ she did n't really even like him that much . '' \\n▁ he laughed when he looked at emily , and even she managed a small smile . \\n▁ ` ` i read her mind - saw all the times she just wanted to whack him with a baseball bat . '' \\n▁ ` ` i knew it was wrong to feel that way , '' em added . \\n▁ ` ` to hate someone so much but find yourself crying every night because they wo n't ever love you . \\n▁ i mean , every time he looked at me , i 'd wish he 'd see that i was the one for him but , inside , if i really thought about it , there was nothing i actually liked about david . '' \\n▁ ` ` when i realised this , i swept her hair back and , sure enough , she was marked , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` i could ' ve given her the memory back . \\n▁ i could have made her aware that this obsession was purely a spirit bind , but it would ' ve eventually killed her . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'd been admitted into psychiatric care already , '' emily said , her voice shaking . \\n▁ ` ` when i told you i 'd seen a counsellor over losing jason , i lied - '' ` ` it was always about david . '' \\n▁ i nodded to myself . \\n▁ jason slid over to wrap his arm around me . \\n▁ ` ` she would ' ve killed herself eventually . \\n▁ so , i xxunk her to break the bind . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's why you never told me the reason you bit her . '' \\n▁ i looked up at him quickly . \\n▁ ` ` that 's why you avoided it . '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i always planned to tell you , though , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you … '' i eyed emily 's neck . \\n▁ ` ` you ripped her apart when you - '' ` ` i had to make it look like an attack . \\n▁ she was n't conscious at the time . \\n▁ i would n't do that . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . '' \\n▁ i covered my lips with the very tips of my fingers . \\n▁ ` ` jase , i hated you so much for turning her like that . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he took my hand away from my mouth and kissed it . \\n▁ ` ` but i knew you 'd learn the truth eventually . \\n▁ it was better for you to hate me at the time than david . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you were so fragile . \\n▁ you thought you needed him to survive , which - '' he laughed , looking away for a second , '' - turns out was n't just a psychological dependence , like i thought . \\n▁ it was physical . '' \\n▁ ` ` physical ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ you literally needed him to survive . \\n▁ without his blood , ara , you 'd have gotten pretty sick . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , right . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes at myself . \\n▁ ` ` so … does david know you remember , em ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` the first memory that came back to me was … that night . '' \\n▁ ` ` that night ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the night they had sex , '' jase said . \\n▁ ` ` but … you attacked him when you first woke as a vampire . \\n▁ was that because of - '' ` ` yep . '' \\n▁ she bit her lip . \\n▁ ` ` i was kind of reliving it . '' \\n▁ i got up on my knees and crawled a bit closer to her . \\n▁ ` ` em ? \\n▁ what did he do to you ? '' \\n▁ she wiped the side of her wrist down her nose , her eyes sparkling with a coat of tears . \\n▁ ` ` emily , did he rape you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she said , holding a very tight breath , her whole jaw quivering . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to tell her ? '' \\n▁ jason asked softly . \\n▁ she nodded , sniffling . \\n▁ ` ` ara , '' jase said , ` ` come here . '' \\n▁ i crawled over and snuggled into his waiting arm , then reached across and took emily 's hand ; she was so tense , her small hand wet with tears , tight and almost unwilling to be against mine . \\n▁ like i was the enemy . \\n▁ or maybe she was afraid i 'd hate her . \\n▁ but , right now , i only felt more love for that poor girl than i ever had before . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , em , '' i said , shaking her hand a bit . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not mad at you . '' \\n▁ she nodded against her knee , chewing her thumbnail . \\n▁ ` ` she knows that , ara . \\n▁ but she just ca n't bear to look you in the eye . '' \\n▁ i squeezed her hand again . \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ i do n't understand why you 're so upset if you know i ' m not mad with you . '' \\n▁ jason began with a sigh . \\n▁ ` ` she 's never talked about this with anyone . '' \\n▁ ` ` except mike , '' she said coldly . \\n▁ ` ` and he hates me now . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just … '' she sobbed inaudibly . \\n▁ ` ` he thinks i ' m disgusting for letting it happen . '' \\n▁ jason pulled her into his chest , too , giving her a long kiss on the head , tightening his hold around me at the same time . \\n▁ ` ` you are not disgusting , emily pierce . \\n▁ and mike has no right to blame you . '' \\n▁ ` ` he blames her ? '' \\n▁ i nearly barfed the words out . \\n▁ ` ` he would n't listen when i tried to explain . \\n▁ he just thinks i did it because i loved david . '' \\n▁ ` ` is that not the reason ? '' \\n▁ i asked innocently . \\n▁ her and jase winced . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a long story , ara , and i guess the event does n't really have a point of origin . \\n▁ it kind of all led to them having sex , but - '' ` ` the event ? \\n▁ i ' m lost , '' i said . \\n▁ ` ` em had been given a hard time at school by a few of the jocks , '' jase explained . \\n▁ ` ` there was this club … '' ` ` we had no choice but to be in it , '' emily cried . \\n▁ ` ` if you wanted to be a cheerleader , you had to run with the jocks . '' \\n▁ i nodded in understanding . \\n▁ ` ` they were about sixteen at the time , '' jase continued . \\n▁ ` ` and a couple of girls started bragging about losing their virginity . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , naturally , the boys wanted in . '' \\n▁ em half smiled , rolling her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` they came up with this lottery where they 'd put girls ' names in a hat and draw them out . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , what , you 'd sleep with that guy ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ emily nodded . \\n▁ ` ` everyone did it . \\n▁ we … if any of the girls were against it , they never said anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because you 'd be labelled a frigid outcast . '' \\n▁ my brows went high and i exhaled loudly . \\n▁ i remembered too well the lows you 'd stoop to to fit in at school . \\n▁ ` ` one day , just after i first met david , my name was drawn , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` to be with david ? '' \\n▁ i asked , nodding to myself . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` brody , that big guy that always threw food . '' \\n▁ my lip turned . \\n▁ ` ` gross . '' \\n▁ she nodded , laughing once . \\n▁ ` ` i went to the locker room at lunch , but brody was n't there yet . \\n▁ so , i waited . \\n▁ and i was so scared i just wanted to leave . '' \\n▁ i pictured her there in the boys ' locker room , tugging her mini cheerleading skirt down her legs , shuffling her feet , checking the clock then the door . \\n▁ ` ` did he chicken out ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he brought friends , '' jason said . \\n▁ i stiffened . \\n▁ ` ` they just wanted to watch - film it , you know ? '' \\n▁ emily said , barely able to control her obvious upset . \\n▁ ` ` i tried to back out , so they … '' ` ` they pinned her down . '' \\n▁ i covered my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` was david one of those guys ? '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` he was in the club , but he never drew from the hat . '' \\n▁ and i strangely felt relief . \\n▁ ` ` anyway , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` i screamed and tried to fight them off . \\n▁ but they were too strong for me . \\n▁ then , next thing i know , brody hits the locker and your dad 's there pinning him against it . '' \\n▁ ` ` my dad ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` the boys scattered , and mr thompson wrapped me up in his jacket and took me to the office - called my mom . '' \\n▁ ` ` those boys got a two - week suspension , '' jase said , his eyes narrowing with fury . \\n▁ ` ` and that was it . \\n▁ they were n't even forced to make an apology . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they told the principal they were just kidding - an april fool 's joke . '' \\n▁ ` ` and she believed them ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ emily nodded . \\n▁ ` ` just ` ` boys being boys '' was what they said . \\n▁ but - '' ` ` but ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they looked at me like i was nothing , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` i think they thought that , because my name had been drawn , i wanted it or something , you know ? '' \\n▁ i could only drop my head against my fingertips , shocked but also not surprised . \\n▁ ` ` and that 's how david and i became friends . '' \\n▁ my forehead crinkled . \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he ran up to me the next day at school and said that what happened was n't fair . \\n▁ he said he 'd make sure those guys never touched me again . '' \\n▁ ` ` what did he do to them ? '' \\n▁ emily shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` but they never touched me again . '' \\n▁ jase 's eyes shrunk with a knowing smile . \\n▁ ` ` after that , we started hanging out more , you know . \\n▁ he and i , we … well , we just kind of got along really well . '' \\n▁ ` ` you mean because you ignored all his dark ways ? '' \\n▁ i said . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , kinda . '' \\n▁ her gaze went distant . \\n▁ ` ` but , word had gotten out that i was frigid , and people started picking on me . \\n▁ those jocks were the least of my problems then , and i was even kicked out of the cheerleading squad . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , lem me get this straight . '' \\n▁ i held my hand up . \\n▁ ` ` you nearly get raped by a bunch of boys , and you end up the outcast ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yup , '' she said . \\n▁ ` ` until the night of summer 's birthday party . '' \\n▁ ` ` what happened then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i walked into her house , and everyone just stared at me . \\n▁ but … i always went to summer 's party . \\n▁ i just never even imagined i 'd be uninvited , you know ? \\n▁ she was my best friend at the time . '' \\n▁ i nodded , taking her hand again . \\n▁ ` ` one of the guys told me to get out , and david comes running up , grabs my hand and says , ` she 's with me ' . \\n▁ and that was it . \\n▁ that was the last time anyone ever picked on me . \\n▁ on monday , at school , summer came up and said i was back on the team . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , they thought you were going out with him ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ they knew he did n't date anyone . \\n▁ but they knew he was ` okay ' with me . \\n▁ so they kind of had to be too , but i knew they were all faking it . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's why you were so quick to jump on all the new kids . '' \\n▁ i nodded to myself , thinking back to our first day . \\n▁ ` ` because you did n't have any real friends left ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , and … it kind of made me latch on to david in a lot of ways , too , since he was the only one who was genuinely nice to me . \\n▁ well - '' she brushed a strand of hair from her cheek . \\n▁ ` ` sometimes . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that 's how you ended up having sex ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she looked at jason and they both smiled . \\n▁ ` ` david could be really horrible when he wanted . \\n▁ i mean , he was nice in the david - sort - of - way , but he 'd make me feel stupid and worthless and , for some reason , that only made me want him more . '' \\n▁ i cringed along with her , knowing too well how easy it was to fall into that . \\n▁ ` ` bad thing was , i did n't care what he did to hurt my feelings because , on the days he was nice , it far outweighed all the horrid things he said . '' \\n▁ ` ` she was traumatised by what those jocks nearly did to her , ara , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` she had no one to talk to that even believed her , aside from david . '' \\n▁ ` ` even my own mother did n't believe me , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` the only other person who did was your dad , ara . '' \\n▁ i saw my dad 's face in my mind - saw the way emily used to look at him , and it all made sense . \\n▁ ` ` things were n't good for me at home , '' she continued . \\n▁ ` ` i tried to go hang out with david as much as possible , but he likes his space , you know . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and he had rules , '' she said , her thoughts making her eyes distant . \\n▁ ` ` i broke one of those rules , and that 's what started everything . '' \\n▁ ` ` what rule ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was n't allowed to tell anyone i was at his house . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just in case he killed her , '' jason said . \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ emily shivered a little , her hand tightening on mine . \\n▁ ` ` anyway , one afternoon my mom got in my face about a few things , and i stormed out . \\n▁ she asked where i was going and , without thinking , told her i was going over to david 's . \\n▁ but , when i got there , he was in one of his moods , as usual . \\n▁ and when he found out that i 'd told my mom where i was , he was so mad that i actually got scared . \\n▁ so , i left and told him i never wanted to see him again . \\n▁ he demanded i come back , but i did n't . \\n▁ later , he showed up at my house . '' \\n▁ ` ` long story short , '' jason said , ` ` emily was his little lamb - the wide - eyed innocent creature that would follow him anywhere . \\n▁ for her to stand up to him like that - '' jase shook his head , exhaling . \\n▁ ` ` he needed the upper hand again . \\n▁ he needed control of her . '' \\n▁ emily shrunk a little more . \\n▁ ` ` he was my first , ara . \\n▁ and i really - '' she closed her eyes for a second , her lips turning down so deeply her chin crinkled . \\n▁ ` ` really wish i could take it all back . '' \\n▁ ` ` does he ? '' \\n▁ ` ` does he what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` does he regret it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why do you think he never wanted you to know ? '' \\n▁ jason said . \\n▁ ` ` was … did he ever plan to turn her ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` knowing she 'd die after being bound to him . '' \\n▁ jason shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` he 's done this to so many girls , ara . \\n▁ i ' ve lost count . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` every time he took his xxunk leave , a trail of girls were left in his wake - usually committing suicide within about two months of him leaving . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you were gon na be his next tragic summer romance , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` lucky for you , he fell in love with you instead . '' \\n▁ all the pictures of my past flitted to mind , so bright with the yellow light of the sun that every breath of summer filled me with nothing but joy , suddenly dying under the rolling cloud of revelation . \\n▁ but i was n't that surprised , not after everything i 'd learned about him since the day we met . \\n▁ i 'd seen the signs . \\n▁ i knew what kind of man he was . \\n▁ i also knew he was remorseful . \\n▁ yet it hurt so deeply that he did n't tell me any of this . \\n▁ and i just wanted to smack him . \\n▁ ` ` why would he lie to me ? \\n▁ i asked him directly if he 'd been with you . \\n▁ why did n't he just tell me the truth ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to be honest , ara , '' jason said , ` ` he regrets it all so deeply he ca n't even say the words . '' \\n▁ ` ` the moment he fell for you , all that human compassion he 'd pushed aside came rushing to the surface , '' emily said . \\n▁ ` ` and he was dead ashamed of himself . \\n▁ he still is . '' \\n▁ david 's own words rang through me then , healing a small chunk of my heart , but not enough for me to forget the lies : love me for who i am now , not what i was then . \\n▁ ` ` why is he so ashamed ? \\n▁ just for sleeping with you ? '' \\n▁ i kind of laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not that hideous , emily . '' \\n▁ she laughed too , but the smile fell away quickly and she just sat there toying with the hem of her dress . \\n▁ ` ` it was more because of … how it happened . '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked unconsciously onto jason , who bit his lip . \\n▁ ` ` jase ? \\n▁ how did it happen ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he - '' ` ` it 's something you need to ask him , '' emily cut in . \\n▁ ` ` em , you know he 'll never tell me . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you 'll never know , '' she said , holding my gaze . \\n▁ jason 's green eyes stood out in my peripheral , slightly warmed with a hint of a smile he could never erase , but cold with the concern he had for me right then . \\n▁ i held em 's gaze as long as i could , but she was n't backing down . \\n▁ whatever david did to her , she was protecting him , and i wanted to know why . \\n▁ ` ` fine ? '' \\n▁ i said , standing up . \\n▁ ` ` do n't tell me . \\n▁ i 'll ask him . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ jason called . \\n▁ ` ` do n't . '' \\n▁ i heard emily say . \\n▁ ` ` just let her go . '' \\n▁ ` ` but she should n't be near him , he might - '' i stopped listening . \\n▁ i just did n't care what david might do . \\n▁ my limbs were driven by a force much stronger than fear or curiosity ; they were driven by undiluted anger - years worth of lies and betrayal all rolling into one giant ball of fury . \\n▁ i slept with jase , and that was bad , yeah , but this … well , at least i did n't knowingly carry the lie from beginning to end . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ arthur called as i passed at full human speed on the stairwell . \\n▁ ` ` where are you going ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to find david . '' \\n▁ ` ` he 's in his new room . \\n▁ is everything all right ? '' \\n▁ my fists clenched tighter by my sides . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , wait ? '' \\n▁ he called , but i did n't wait . \\n▁ i marched step by step to the third floor and turned the corner , seeing david by the window outside his room ; he stood in casual clothes with his hands in his pockets , his troubled gaze on the yard below . \\n▁ the afternoon sun lit his face , making his hair glow with those golden tones i 'd always loved , and it just made the pain go so much deeper . \\n▁ he 'd turn and look at me , maybe hear what i had to say , but his eyes would never smile at me again . \\n▁ i 'd never see love there again . \\n▁ he laid something on the windowsill , looking up in shock when he saw me coming . \\n▁ ` ` ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you ass * * le ! '' \\n▁ i lashed out to slap him across the face , but he spun and grabbed my wrist before contact , hooking his foot under my ankle to flip me onto the floor at his feet . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing , ara ? '' \\n▁ ` ` let go of me . '' \\n▁ i wriggled out of his grip . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so mad at you . \\n▁ you looked me in the eye , and you lied to me . '' \\n▁ he stood back , his eyes shrinking , focusing then smiling as realisation flooded through him . \\n▁ ` ` hurts , does n't it ? '' \\n▁ i hugged my knee to my chest . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ i ' m glad they told you . \\n▁ i ' m glad it 's out now , and it could n't have come at better time . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because you deserve to suffer . \\n▁ what i did was a long time ago . \\n▁ i never even knew you then , so you have no right to comment . \\n▁ but what you did , well - '' he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` you pretty much deserve to burn in hell , you worthless little whore . '' \\n▁ i looked up quickly into his icy green eyes . \\n▁ ` ` how can you say that to me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` easy . \\n▁ i have absolutely no care anymore for how you feel . '' \\n▁ he jammed his hands in his pockets , rocking back on his heels . \\n▁ ` ` it 's rather liberating , really . '' \\n▁ i made myself smaller . \\n▁ ` ` oh , get up . '' \\n▁ he dragged me to stand . \\n▁ ` ` do n't sit there and wallow in it . \\n▁ no one 's going to care . '' \\n▁ i jerked my arm from his grip . \\n▁ ` ` that 's where you 're wrong . \\n▁ people do care about me , david . \\n▁ some of them care no matter what mistakes i ' ve made . '' \\n▁ ` ` guess they 're the fools then , are n't they ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i turned away . \\n▁ ` ` they 're ones worthy of my love in return . '' \\n▁ ` ` did n't know that was possible , '' he scoffed . \\n▁ my footsteps halted . \\n▁ i spun slowly around and marched back up to him . \\n▁ ` ` you know what ? \\n▁ you 're a jerk , and the truth is , i do have a right to be hurt about what you did to emily - '' ` ` to emily ? '' \\n▁ he cut in . \\n▁ ` ` you mean with emily . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i mean to . \\n▁ because i do n't think it was consensual . \\n▁ the way she talked about it - '' ` ` what did she say ? '' \\n▁ he grabbed my arm . \\n▁ ` ` why would you ask that ? '' \\n▁ i peeled his fingers off me . \\n▁ ` ` if it was mutual , then - '' ` ` so you think i raped her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not raped her . '' \\n▁ i held his gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i know you , and despite you having been this monster in your past , i would never label you something horrid . \\n▁ but i do n't believe she wanted to do it wholeheartedly . \\n▁ and i do n't believe you cared all that much . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i do n't really care what you think . '' \\n▁ he gazed out the window again , severing the conversation . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not my opinion that matters here , david . \\n▁ it 's the facts . \\n▁ you used her . \\n▁ you took her virginity so you could control her . '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps i did . \\n▁ so what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` had you told me you slept with her before we started dating , i would have been okay with it . \\n▁ i would have , '' i repeated when he grunted . \\n▁ ` ` had you told me you forced her so you could make her do whatever you wanted … '' i took a few steps away from him . \\n▁ ` ` i would ' ve avoided you like the plague . '' \\n▁ he looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're sick , '' i added , my lip lifting in disgust . \\n▁ ` ` and everything you ' ve done - the way you ' ve acted since i told you the truth about jason and i , has only proven to me that nothing about that monster you were back then has really changed . \\n▁ and a part of me , david - '' i looked him in the eye for a very long moment , '' - is glad you broke it off with me , because i ca n't stand to look at you now . '' \\n▁ ` ` get back here , ara ! '' \\n▁ he yelled as i walked away . \\n▁ ` ` ara ! '' \\n▁ ` ` just leave me alone , '' i muttered . \\n▁ ` ` do n't ever talk to me again . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he grabbed my arm and spun me around . \\n▁ ` ` it does n't end like this . \\n▁ you do n't get to walk away and think whatever you want about me . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i tired to pull free but he would n't let me . \\n▁ ` ` because you want the upper hand ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you swore to me , ara , that you would love me no matter what ; that you would not look at the things i 'd done in my past and judge me - '' ` ` and you swore to love and honour me , too , david . \\n▁ but as soon as that love was tested , as soon as i told you one of my dark truths , you threw that in my face . \\n▁ you did n't even try to understand . \\n▁ in fact , you 're going as far as to have me punished for it . \\n▁ but what do i get to do ? \\n▁ how do i get to free myself from the anger i feel for the lies you told me - repeatedly ? \\n▁ i never looked you in the eye and told you i had n't slept with jason . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` no , worse , you just kept it from me - '' ` ` i did n't keep it from you , '' i yelled , shocking david a bit . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know it 'd happened . \\n▁ and if i had , i would ' ve told you immediately after . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you would n't . \\n▁ you did n't . \\n▁ you went to the lighthouse . \\n▁ you took your problems there , and you were careless . \\n▁ you let yourself fall , and i do n't think it was an accident . \\n▁ i think you - '' ` ` what ? \\n▁ jumped ? '' \\n▁ i laughed like that was ludicrous . \\n▁ ` ` i would n't have saved you , you know , '' he said quietly , looking out the window again . \\n▁ ` ` if i 'd known then , i would have drowned you myself . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , i ca n't comment on you sleeping with emily , but it 's okay for you to say you 'd kill me - it 's okay for you to hurt me , torture me because i had another man inside me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not just another man , ara ! \\n▁ my own brother - someone i ' ve hated all my life . \\n▁ how could you ? \\n▁ how could you stand the feel of him between your legs ? \\n▁ how could you - '' ` ` he 's not as repulsive to me as he is to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` clearly . '' \\n▁ ` ` you know what ? '' \\n▁ i threw my hands up . \\n▁ ` ` what 's done is done . \\n▁ i ca n't undo it , and i do n't have to put up with you being an ass * * le to me . \\n▁ i did wrong . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ i deserve to lose my marriage . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ but i do not deserve to have you in my face reminding me of that mistake every day . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you admit it ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` it was a mistake . '' \\n▁ ` ` god , what is your problem ? \\n▁ do you really think i lay awake at night reliving it like some fantasy i wish i could repeat ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure what you do . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you clearly do n't know me very well . '' \\n▁ ` ` as recent events would indicate . '' \\n▁ i let the silence hang for a second . \\n▁ but i always let him have the last word . \\n▁ and it just was n't good enough anymore . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't be the victim , you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it means i wo n't put up with you taking your anger out on me anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` no one said you had to . '' \\n▁ he graced me with some eye contact then . \\n▁ ` ` but you ca n't expect me to be civil to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` actually , i can , '' i said , for once feeling strong enough to stand up to him . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to love me . \\n▁ hell , you do n't even have to like me , but you will respect me . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , then let me rephrase that . '' \\n▁ he stepped into my territorial bubble , his height suddenly intimidating . \\n▁ ` ` if you think , for one second , that i ' m going to be anything but cruel to you , do anything but torture you for the rest of my days , you ' ve got a lot of learning to do . \\n▁ and since the only way you ever learn , ara - rose , is the hard way - '' he smiled malevolently . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to enjoy this . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow , '' i said , taking another step back . \\n▁ ` ` i had no idea just how deep your darkness went . \\n▁ you 're like a spiteful little girl . \\n▁ and i know it 's because you 're hurt . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i get that . \\n▁ but what you 're showing me right now , david , is that you still love m - '' ` ` love ? '' \\n▁ he slowly cupped both my arms and walked me back toward the wall . \\n▁ ` ` is it love when a man lies awake in his bed at night , comforted by the horrid acts he could perform on a girl 's body ? \\n▁ is it love when he finds himself standing over her with a dagger in his hand while she 's sleeping ? \\n▁ is it love when he contemplates throwing her to a pack of rabid prisoners and watching them defile her - '' ` ` like you did to pepper ? '' \\n▁ i spat . \\n▁ his eyes widened , the contents of his stomach seeming to come up in his throat until he swallowed them down , gripping my arms so tight my fingers went numb . \\n▁ i tried to count backward in my head , to go back in time and just stop myself from saying that . \\n▁ i 'd wanted to hurt him , but the pain i saw eat his soul then just was n't worth it . \\n▁ it was childish and stupid . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , david . \\n▁ i should n't have said that . '' \\n▁ he was frozen , though , his fingers locked onto my arms like a cursed statue . \\n▁ ` ` david , please . \\n▁ you 're hurting me . '' \\n▁ my back pressed more firmly into the wall with each second passing , the plaster dipping under my weight , but he did n't back down . \\n▁ the anger in him was growing - flashes of pepper 's suffering flickering in his thoughts for me to see . \\n▁ i closed my eyes , turning my head to block them out , but they were there , and they were too real : her golden hair , turned almost orange with blood , her face mashed into the dirt floor under her naked body , her eyes catching david 's as the fat , dirty man pinning her down entered her , tearing her so deeply she screamed for her beloved . \\n▁ but he just stood there , pinned back by the guards , frozen by a veil of knowledge mixed with shock that he could n't lift - couldn ' t escape long enough to find some common sense and free her . \\n▁ the man entered her again , but she looked away this time , ashamed , hiding her face . \\n▁ she knew david would n't help her . \\n▁ she did n't care that he clearly could n't , all she knew was that he would n't . \\n▁ and she hated him then . \\n▁ she dug her fingernails into the earth and just held her breath - lying there and letting them punish her , crying only his name and the sobbing remnant of the word ` why . ' \\n▁ as the replay stopped and the rushing of wind in my ears and the echo of her haunted screams died down , the day around me returned . \\n▁ i looked up at david , seeing tears in his eyes for the first time since he learned what i did to betray him . \\n▁ ` ` you know nothing of what pepper suffered , '' he said in an eerily calm voice , and let go of my arms , pulling me up off the wall just a little first . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk - '' i started , but he walked away , ignoring me . \\n▁ fear kept me where i stood , fighting the voice in my head that told me to run after him . \\n▁ everything i said - everything - was the hurt in me talking . \\n▁ and i regretted it deeply , all of it . \\n▁ especially saying i would never have loved him if i 'd known what he did to emily . \\n▁ i did n't mean that . \\n▁ i felt it at the time , but i did n't really mean it . \\n▁ i swore then , that no matter what he did next to make me suffer , i would never stoop to that level again , never say anything i knew would kill him inside . \\n▁ he was n't the monster anymore . \\n▁ i was . \\n▁ and that was all i needed to move my feet . \\n▁ i darted after him , blocking his path on the narrow stairwell , both my arms reaching across to either side of the railing . \\n▁ ` ` stop . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , get out of my way . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ you need to listen . '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing you have to say is of any consequence to me . \\n▁ you wanted me to leave you alone , never talk to you again , well … you got your wish . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not what i want , david . \\n▁ i was angry . \\n▁ and i ' m so sorry for what i said about pepper . '' \\n▁ his glassy green eyes softened a little then as he saw the truth deep inside me . \\n▁ ` ` that will never suffice , ara . \\n▁ you knew , before you said that , the extent of the damage it would do . \\n▁ so do n't try to take it back now . '' \\n▁ i crossed my hands over my heart , guilt eating it up until i could n't feel it beat anymore . \\n▁ ` ` now , get out of my way before i do something to hurt you , '' he added . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not afraid of you , david . \\n▁ i know you wo n't hurt me . '' \\n▁ ` ` then you know nothing about me . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i faced him as he pushed past . \\n▁ ` ` i know you 're ashamed of what you did to emily . '' \\n▁ the vampire in him surfaced , stopping him in his tracks , changing the way he held himself . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not ashamed , ara . '' \\n▁ ` ` i think you are . '' \\n▁ he turned slowly and walked back up the stairs , stopping on the one just above me . \\n▁ ` ` just tell me why you never talked about it with me , david - why , even after i asked you , you lied . '' \\n▁ ` ` our marriage is over . \\n▁ you deserve no explanation from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he went to walk past again . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't . '' \\n▁ i grabbed his arm . \\n▁ ` ` i do , david , because , despite what i ' ve done wrong , i married you . \\n▁ we shared a life together and i am the mother of your child . \\n▁ you do owe me an explanation . '' \\n▁ ` ` get away from me , '' he yelled . \\n▁ ` ` there 's nothing to explain . '' \\n▁ i blocked his path again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not going anywhere until you answer me . '' \\n▁ he frowned at me , a little surprised . \\n▁ ` ` you 're really not going to let this go , are you ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` fine . '' \\n▁ he leaned on the wall and folded his arms . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't tell you because , when we first met , you and emily were already friends , and i never planned to be with you past the summer . \\n▁ when that changed , it was too late to tell you . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because you 'd have gone crazy , ara . \\n▁ you 'd never have trusted me after that . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course i would have , david . \\n▁ i would ' ve trusted you more knowing you would always tell me the truth - even if i did n't like it . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's bull crap , ara . \\n▁ you would ' ve hated me - left me . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you kidding ? '' \\n▁ i jerked forward . \\n▁ ` ` david , you know me ! \\n▁ look at me . \\n▁ look at who i am inside , '' i said , tapping my chest . \\n▁ ` ` even if you 'd slept with her while we were together , you know i 'd have found it in my heart to forgive you . '' \\n▁ ` ` huh ! '' \\n▁ he scoffed , looking away . \\n▁ ` ` david . '' \\n▁ i touched his wrist and he looked back at me . \\n▁ ` ` you know that . '' \\n▁ his folded arms dropped slowly to his sides . \\n▁ he could n't deny the truth in that statement . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right . \\n▁ i should ' ve told you . \\n▁ i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ those words moved in through my ears and made everything in me feel warm and kind of renewed , taking the anger and diluting it until it was nothing . \\n▁ ` ` i forgive you , you know . '' \\n▁ ` ` you what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know you do n't need my forgiveness , but … you and em , it 's in the past , david , and - '' ` ` ara . '' \\n▁ he stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't say that until you know the full story . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` when i decided to be with you , i accepted you then for everything you were and had been in your past . \\n▁ good or bad . \\n▁ i ca n't take that back now just because i find out that you ' ve done something you 're not proud of . \\n▁ you did n't rape her . \\n▁ you might not have been what she wanted her first to be , but i know you 're good inside , david , and - '' ` ` that 's just it , ara . \\n▁ i ' m not . '' \\n▁ my mouth stayed open , still shaped to my last word . \\n▁ ` ` she cried , '' he started , shifting awkwardly to a new position . \\n▁ ` ` she said it hurt , and i just rolled her over and told her to shut up - hid her face because i did n't wan na see her tears . '' \\n▁ and with his words came images , ones i made up in my own mind . \\n▁ ` ` did she ask you to stop ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i told her the pain was normal for the first time . \\n▁ but it was n't . \\n▁ if i 'd been gentle … if i 'd … '' he folded the back of his hand to his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` if you 'd been like you were with me . '' \\n▁ a quick memory lit his thoughts up - of he and i in my room - our first time , and he smiled , shaking his head until a frown came over like a grey cloud . \\n▁ ` ` i hurt her , and i made her feel ashamed of herself , made her feel like she was worth nothing to anyone . \\n▁ and , the worst part was , ara , i just did n't care . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you had no human compassion . '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't . \\n▁ which made being friends with her after the compassion set in really hard . \\n▁ so hard i … i just wanted to forget it happened . '' \\n▁ ` ` funny , i 'd kinda like to forget it , too . '' \\n▁ i rubbed my head as if i could erase the last hour of my life . \\n▁ david laughed . \\n▁ it was so nice to hear that laugh again . \\n▁ ` ` perhaps we can all just move past it , then . '' \\n▁ i lowered my hand to my side and nodded up at the king . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure mike will feel the same way . '' \\n▁ reality moved back in to this vortex we 'd stepped in then , and everything crappy my life had become in the last week surfaced again . \\n▁ david breathed out through his nose , accepting that fact and many others that had changed his life lately , too . \\n▁ ` ` i have to go . '' \\n▁ ` ` david , wait . '' \\n▁ i went to grab him , but he tugged away . \\n▁ ` ` just do n't , ara . \\n▁ you know about emily now , and it 's very kind of you to say you forgive me , but … '' he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` nothing has changed . \\n▁ i still hate you . \\n▁ i - '' ` ` well , i need to discuss something else with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` then it had better be some royal matter . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is a royal matter . '' \\n▁ ` ` then make it quick . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's about the king and queen . '' \\n▁ his eyes were on something other than me , but i caught the slightest glimpse of a half smile as he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` very well . \\n▁ what is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i just wanted you to know that … jason asked me to marry him . '' \\n▁ ` ` wondered how long that would take . '' \\n▁ he huffed , clearly not surprised . \\n▁ i let silence own the moment for a second , waiting to see if he 'd ask what my response was . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't need to ask , ara , '' he said , stealing that thought . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not wearing a ring . \\n▁ clearly , you declined . '' \\n▁ ` ` for now , '' i said , leaving it at that . \\n▁ ` ` and what 's that supposed to mean ? '' \\n▁ i toyed nervously with the key on my necklace . \\n▁ ` ` it means that … one day , i 'll probably say yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` one day , huh ? '' \\n▁ he folded his arms again . \\n▁ ` ` if he keeps asking , and i ' m still single … yeah . '' \\n▁ ` ` is this some kind of prompt to force me into begging you to - '' ` ` no , david , it 's not . '' \\n▁ i raised a hand to shut him up . \\n▁ ` ` i just did n't want you to hear it along the grapevine . '' \\n▁ ` ` then consider me informed . '' \\n▁ he bowed , turning away . \\n▁ ` ` so , you do n't care if i marry him ? '' \\n▁ i called . \\n▁ he stopped at the base of the stairs , eyeing a man in his peripheral until he passed out of sight . \\n▁ ` ` frankly , i have no opinion . \\n▁ i never could stop you from doing stupid things . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would it be stupid ? '' \\n▁ i walked a few steps downward . \\n▁ ` ` if he loves me and i love him , why - '' ` ` you 're right , '' he said , throwing his hands up . \\n▁ ` ` guess it makes perfect sense . \\n▁ i hope you 're both happy . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not what i want you to say , you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` then , what , ara ? '' \\n▁ he turned back to face me . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk you want me to say ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i want you to tell me not to . \\n▁ i want you tell me that you still love me enough that , one day , even years from now , you might forgive me for what i did . '' \\n▁ he just laughed . \\n▁ ` ` that will never happen . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? \\n▁ you forgave xxunk when she betrayed her husband - with your uncle . '' \\n▁ i could see his eyes narrow as he calculated a response . \\n▁ but what could he say to that ? \\n▁ ` ` well , xxunk was n't my wife . \\n▁ had she been , she would have suffered the same fate victor served . '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't mean that , '' i called , running after him . \\n▁ ` ` david , please tell me you do n't mean that . '' \\n▁ ` ` ara , just back off ! '' \\n▁ he shoved my hand off his arm . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve put me in a corner here . \\n▁ i do n't want to hurt you , but if you do n't leave me the hell alone , i can not be held responsible for what i might do to you . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you are angry then ? '' \\n▁ i refused to step back , despite his body language warning me to move . \\n▁ ` ` about the proposal ? '' \\n▁ ` ` god , when are you going learn , ara ? '' \\n▁ he pushed past and headed back up the stairs . \\n▁ i followed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not leaving you alone until i get some kind of communication breakthrough with you , david . \\n▁ you ca n't just shut down and refuse to discuss things . '' \\n▁ ` ` and which scroll states that law ? '' \\n▁ he asked , walking away almost faster than i could keep up . \\n▁ ` ` not everything is about the law . \\n▁ maybe it 's just wrong to end a marriage and never give the other person a chance to have their say . '' \\n▁ ` ` why should i , ara ? '' \\n▁ he spun back , barring me with his cold stare . \\n▁ ` ` you talk things through with someone when you want peace , want to sort things out . \\n▁ but i do n't care what you have to say . \\n▁ nothing will ever make me want to forgive you . \\n▁ nothing will ever make what you did okay , not on any level . \\n▁ we can never be friends again , ara . \\n▁ we can never even be in the same room without me wanting to strangle you . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not how you really feel . '' \\n▁ i moved between him and the path to his room . \\n▁ ` ` you want to break me down emotionally , but you wo n't put your hands on me . '' \\n▁ ` ` if you know that , ara , if you 're so sure of that , then why keep pushing me ? '' \\n▁ he tried to move past me again but i blocked him . \\n▁ ` ` why torture me by giving me no way out of this conversation ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because there 's no other way i can make you talk . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would you want that ? \\n▁ why would you want to talk when you know how much i hate you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i ' m hoping i can change your mind - hoping the david i love is still in there and that you 'll see i ' m still the girl you love , that i just made a mistake . '' \\n▁ ` ` that will not ever happen , ara , '' he said stiffly , and for the first time , something about the way he said that made me truly believe him . \\n▁ ` ` so , that 's just it , then ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he said , his shoulders dropping with relief . \\n▁ ` ` so just leave me alone and let me get on with my life , okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` fine , '' i said , and watched him disappear into his bedroom , wishing i 'd never come up here to talk with him . \\n▁ that brief moment where we spoke as equals would forever be the little piece of hope i held onto that prevented me from truly moving on . \\n▁ i knew that . \\n▁ we 'd survived torture , separation , immortality and heartbreak , but i was beginning to think maybe it was time for me to admit that we could n't survive the damage done deeper than skin - leaving the heart scarred and unidentifiable as what it once was . \\n▁ i wandered over to the windowsill to watch the night rising , and a glimmer of light , just a flash in the corner of my eye , caught my attention , stopping my footsteps . \\n▁ there , settled on the white oak sill was a tiny gold band , turning orange under the evening sun : my wedding band - the one david ripped from my finger . \\n▁ i picked it up and angled it to the sky , catching the first star of the evening within the golden circle . \\n▁ all my wishes had come true with this little gold band , and it all had come undone so easily with just one mistake . \\n▁ just one night of letting my heart run free . \\n▁ but , although i wished i could take back the argument i had with david , i no longer wanted to take back what i did with jase , no longer wished it had n't happened . \\n▁ for the first time since i moved to my dad 's and started my first day of school , i felt alive and free . \\n▁ i knew who i was , where i belonged in the world , and i did n't need anyone : not david , not jase , not even my dad , to make me feel safe , or like i deserved to be here . \\n▁ i made mistakes , and i still had a lot of learning to do , but i was strong , and learned fast , and no matter what anyone thought of me now , i knew i deserved to be alive . \\n▁ and i deserved to be happy . \\n▁ i turned and walked away then , taking the stairs to the second floor , back to my life , leaving the past , and the ring , behind on the windowsill where david had . \\n▁ i was n't sure anymore what tomorrow would bring , or if i 'd ever talk to him again the way we had on the stairs just now , but one thing i did know was that his absence from my life would no longer make or break me . \\n▁ i did n't need him anymore to know who i was . \\n▁ i did n't need him anymore to be okay . \\n▁ i was finally free . \\n▁ finally , just me . \\n▁ i turned and walked away then , taking the stairs to the second floor , back to my life , leaving the past , and the ring , behind on the windowsill where david had . \\n▁ i was n't sure anymore what tomorrow would bring , or if i 'd ever talk to him again the way we had on the stairs just now , but one thing i did know was that his absence from my life would no longer make or break me . \\n▁ i did n't need him anymore to know who i was . \\n▁ i did n't need him anymore to be okay . \\n▁ i was finally free . \\n▁ finally , just me .</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>xxbos prologue i do n't remember the accident . \\n▁ that is the line i give every person who asks … and everybody asks . \\n▁ you would think people would stop asking after awhile , but they have n't . \\n▁ you would think that people would try to avoid talking about such a horrid crash , but they do n't . \\n▁ you would think people would have enough respect of someone 's private , personal hell to not bring it up around them , but they do . \\n▁ when people have the nerve to actually talk to me , it 's usually one of the first things they ask . \\n▁ because i ' m the one that survived . \\n▁ yes , i tell everyone who asks that i remember nothing … but the truth is , i remember everything . \\n▁ the squeal of</td>\n      <td>xxbos prologue i do n't remember the accident . \\n▁ that is the line i give every person who asks … and everybody asks . \\n▁ you would think people would stop asking after awhile , but they have n't . \\n▁ you would think that people would try to avoid talking about such a horrid crash , but they do n't . \\n▁ you would think people would have enough respect of someone 's private , personal hell to not bring it up around them , but they do . \\n▁ when people have the nerve to actually talk to me , it 's usually one of the first things they ask . \\n▁ because i ' m the one that survived . \\n▁ yes , i tell everyone who asks that i remember nothing … but the truth is , i remember everything . \\n▁ the squeal of the tires as i lost control of the car , the blistering screech of metal upon metal as we hit the guard rail on that too sharp corner , the screams that ripped out of my girlfriend 's throat as we went over the embankment . \\n▁ i remember everything … it was nearly summer when the crash happened . \\n▁ we 'd been going through a dry spell here in oregon when a sudden downpour hit the county hard . \\n▁ within seconds , an inch of water was on the roadway . \\n▁ but my friends and i did n't care about that , we did n't even think about it . \\n▁ we were seventeen , we were invincible . \\n▁ death happened to people much older than us . \\n▁ nothing could hurt us … nothing could even touch us . \\n▁ my best friend darren took the back seat with his girlfriend samantha , or sammy as we all called her . \\n▁ they 'd been dating since our freshman year of school . \\n▁ they were head over heels in love with each other , which resulted in endless ribbing from me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're so whipped ! '' \\n▁ i 'd always tell him , when he 'd ditch me , yet again , to go hang out with her . \\n▁ ` ` lucas , one day you 'll get it , '' he 'd always respond . \\n▁ and in a way , i did . \\n▁ sammy was perfect for him : smart , funny , adventurous , and most importantly - patient . \\n▁ tall and athletic , she was the captain of the women 's volleyball team , so darren and i went to a lot of games . \\n▁ that suited me fine ; those shorts they wore were pretty tight . \\n▁ that was also how i met my girlfriend , lillian . \\n▁ she was new to the school last year , and sammy brought her into our little group after she had tried out and made the team . \\n▁ she was blonde and blue eyed , petite and trim , but sculpted perfectly in all the right areas ; practically a barbie doll , as i often teased her . \\n▁ she was outgoing and vivacious and a total flirt . \\n▁ it had n't taken her long to wrap her arms around me , throw her hands into my wavy , brown hair and with a light kiss on the lips , proclaim me as hers . \\n▁ it took even less time for me to actually be hers . \\n▁ and i was . \\n▁ i 'd fallen for that girl in a way that made me suddenly understand why darren ditched me all the time . \\n▁ i 'd do it to him too : blowing him off for a game of basketball in his driveway , canceling on him when we had plans to ride dirt bikes with his brother and ditching him after school when he wanted to go drinking by the river … all to hang out with her . \\n▁ darren and i had been friends since kindergarten though , and he was n't intimidated by the competition . \\n▁ whenever i blew him off he 'd laugh and say , ` ` see … you get it now , right ? '' \\n▁ and i was starting to . \\n▁ i loved lil , and had been dying to tell her that when she slipped into the front seat of the car beside me that night . \\n▁ in fact , i 'd been running over ways to say it as i 'd driven the four of us home from the party we 'd been to , forty minutes away from willamette valley , our home . \\n▁ the answer to the second question everyone always eventually asks me , and that you 're probably wondering right now , is no … i was not drinking that night . \\n▁ darren , sammy and lil had been living it up at the party however . \\n▁ lil even offered me a few , but it was n't really my thing and i stuck to soda for the night . \\n▁ when darren tried to throw a punch at some community college , frat boy wannabe -lrb- who 'd crashed the beach bonfire we 'd gone to -rrb- for grabbing sammy 's ass , i 'd decided he 'd had enough for the evening , and swiped his car keys . \\n▁ he 'd fought me for all of two seconds and then realized that that was pointless . \\n▁ for one , he was shorter and xxunk than me , barely coming up to my chin and coming nowhere near my muscular frame , and in wrestling matches that we 'd had before -lrb- over all too important subjects like ` who got the comfortable chair while we watched the pay - per - view fight ' -rrb- , i 'd always won . \\n▁ and secondly , he could n't stand straight anymore , and he 'd leaned to the side while trying to cuss me out , making both of us bust out laughing . \\n▁ eventually though , i think it was sammy ramming her tongue down his throat and describing all the things they could do in the back seat while i drove them home that finally convinced him that it was a great idea . \\n▁ she 'd winked at me after she said that , her auburn hair beautiful and shining with life in the firelight , much like herself . \\n▁ sammy could always find a way to pacify hot - headed darren . \\n▁ so , no , i was n't drinking and i was n't on drugs . \\n▁ there was nothing physically or mentally wrong with me that night , regardless of what the small town we lived in believed . \\n▁ the fact was , i was driving a car that i was n't entirely used to driving -lrb- and even worse , it was a stick shift , which was n't one of my strong points -rrb- and i was driving a road that i did n't know very well , darren having driven us to the party . \\n▁ and lastly , i was driving much too fast . \\n▁ even with all of that though , i would have been fine . \\n▁ i 'd been doing fine before the crash , laughing and joking with my friends while the three of them passed around a forty ounce and laughed over darren 's feeble attempt to defend sammy 's honor . \\n▁ i was fine right up until the point when i was n't . \\n▁ the night was pitch - black when the sudden downpour hit and obscured my vision even more . \\n▁ i was even fine with that , until i hit an inch of freestanding water a few yards from the corner . \\n▁ the car had started xxunk immediately and my gut instinct was to stop - to stop the car . \\n▁ i 'd slammed on the brakes and the car had fishtailed , starting to spin . \\n▁ i 'd had no control over the car when we 'd entered the bend in the road , and we slammed right into the railing , hitting a weak spot and plummeting right over the side . \\n▁ here is where i forcefully stop my memory . \\n▁ even still , it was always with me : the trees whipping past the car . \\n▁ glass breaking . \\n▁ people screaming . \\n▁ the beer can spilling between lil and i . \\n▁ a rough hit from a tree branch angling the car to the side . \\n▁ the wind being knocked out of me . \\n▁ lil 's door slamming into a boulder at the bottom of the steep hill . \\n▁ lil 's head slamming into the window , shattering it , and her skull . \\n▁ her screams stopping . \\n▁ darren flying over sammy as their unbuckled bodies broke through the inferior metal of darren 's cheap ` ` starter '' car . \\n▁ both of them disappearing into the dark of the night out the open car door . \\n▁ my body jerking against my restraints painfully . \\n▁ my head xxunk back to smack the window . \\n▁ everything going quiet … everything going black . \\n▁ yes , every person i talked to was told the same response : i do n't remember the accident . \\n▁ but i did . \\n▁ i remembered every single detail , even though i prayed i could forget . \\n▁ it haunted me during daylight hours , but that was nothing compared to the hell i went through at night , when i relived the event in my dreams . \\n▁ my screams often woke me , and my mom 's arms were often already around me , as i struggled to remember that i 'd survived and i was safe in my bed . \\n▁ how i wish the same could be said for my best friend , the love of his life … and the love of mine . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; the catastrophe had n't been easy for her either . \\n▁ she adored all of them : darren was a second son , sammy an adopted daughter and lil - i think mom was already picturing picking out baby clothes for the grandchild lil would most certainly give her . \\n▁ but none of those aches compared to the ache of almost losing her own child , of being that close . \\n▁ that scare had left permanent worry lines deep in her features . \\n▁ i kissed a streak of gray on her scalp . \\n▁ ` ` yes , mom . \\n▁ i ' m sure . \\n▁ this will be bad enough without my mommy dropping me off . '' \\n▁ she sighed sadly and clasped my large hand in her small ones . \\n▁ the gaze in her eyes held a look that i 'd seen all too often in the past few weeks . \\n▁ she was drinking me in , absorbing me , in case she did n't ever see me again . \\n▁ i always let her do this . \\n▁ no matter how long she needed to do it . \\n▁ her eyes started on my hair , brown and wavy and longer on the top than she approved of , then she skipped down to my jaw line , smooth for the first time in weeks , since i 'd actually shaved this morning . \\n▁ she glossed over my other features and settled on my eyes , an exact duplicate of her hazel shade . \\n▁ she smoothed out my black t - shirt and reached behind her to hand me my letterman 's jacket . \\n▁ her eyes drifted over the large letters of our last name - west - the only thing my father had given me really . \\n▁ she nodded slightly as she watched me slip the jacket on . \\n▁ her sad eyes traveled back up to mine and a sad smile to match it played on her lips . \\n▁ ` ` have a good day , luc . '' \\n▁ i swallowed and nodded back at her , attempting a smile of reassurance but i ' m sure failing miserably . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , mom . '' \\n▁ i kissed her head again and headed out the front door . \\n▁ my mother watched me as i stood outside in the light drizzle of the morning rain . \\n▁ i saw her hand pulling back the flimsy lace curtain in the kitchen and saw the shadow of her face as she watched over me , protecting me with her vision and i ' m sure multiple silent prayers . \\n▁ i turned back to watch the road . \\n▁ as the raindrops picked up strength , my eyes lingered on one spot of the pavement , where a small puddle was starting to form in a dip in the sidewalk . \\n▁ i watched that puddle , mesmerized . \\n▁ drops plunged heavily into the small circle of water , splashing the edges out further with each steady drip . \\n▁ within moments there was a half inch of depth in that puddle . \\n▁ in my mind , the puddle suddenly became a huge lake on the surface of the now vast sidewalk . \\n▁ in my mind , cars flew over that lake , none of them having an issue with the depth of the water as their tires broke waves into the surface . \\n▁ then , suddenly , i was driving darren 's geo across that lake , and almost the instant the tires hit that water , i started losing control . \\n▁ i also started having trouble breathing . \\n▁ a horn was blaring at me . \\n▁ still lost in my vision , i imagined my hand on the wheel , holding down the horn as i attempted to right the floundering car . \\n▁ someone was yelling … or were they screaming ? \\n▁ always so much screaming . \\n▁ i felt myself hunch over , my breath even weaker . \\n▁ a touch on my shoulder startled me . \\n▁ i looked over to my mother 's worried face , droplets of rain running down her cheeks , like tears . \\n▁ still confused , i wondered what she was doing crying in darren 's car . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay , lucas ? '' \\n▁ she asked as she touched my face . \\n▁ ` ` is he getting in or not ? '' \\n▁ a harsh voice snapped me completely back to reality . \\n▁ i looked up at a surly bus driver staring at me grumpily and i realized he 'd been laying on the horn and yelling at me while i 'd been … confused . \\n▁ i glanced over the windows of the bus and noticed more than a few students laughing at me . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine , mom , '' i muttered as i gave her a quick hug and slunk into the bus . \\n▁ everyone was staring at me as the doors closed and the bus started pulling away . \\n▁ the spectacle on the sidewalk was n't the only reason why either . \\n▁ it was n't just that an upperclassman was on the bus and not driving himself to school . \\n▁ it was n't just that i took the first empty seat and did n't acknowledge any of them . \\n▁ it was because they all knew who i was , even the freshman . \\n▁ i was famous … for the worst possible reason . \\n▁ sheridan was a small town in oregon and sheridan high was even smaller . \\n▁ the entire high school consisted of about three hundred people , and that was a high estimate . \\n▁ a lot of the people had known and liked my friends . \\n▁ everyone on the bus knew my story . \\n▁ everyone on the bus had an opinion on my story . \\n▁ some were quiet about it … others , not so much . \\n▁ from behind where i sat in the front row , i clearly heard , ` ` yeah , i heard he pounded a dozen beers and could barely see straight , let alone drive . '' \\n▁ i clenched my jaw as the crystal clear words hit me ; they were n't even trying to hide the fact that they were talking about me . \\n▁ in an equally loud voice , someone beside the first person answered with , ` ` oh yeah , i heard darren tried to take the keys away , but he threatened to knock him out cold if he did . '' \\n▁ i fisted my hands and closed my eyes as tears started to fill them . \\n▁ they were so wrong … they all had everything so wrong . \\n▁ but nothing i said was going to change their opinion , of me or the night in question . \\n▁ i gritted my teeth and pictured darren in the seat beside me , turning around and blowing up at them in my defense , like i knew he would have . \\n▁ i pictured sammy sitting beside him , putting a hand on his shoulder to try and calm him down , and even though a part of me did n't want to , even though it hurt like hell , i pictured lillian placing her warm hand in mine , squeezing it tight and whispering how much she adored me , urging my fist to relax . \\n▁ the babbling behind me did n't stop however , and those tears in my eyes were threatening to spill down my cheeks . \\n▁ i pushed away the painful image of my friends and the vicious words behind me . \\n▁ to block out everything , i started humming in my head . \\n▁ i could do this . \\n▁ i could give my mom one year and then i 'd leave this nightmare … physically at least . \\n▁ i managed to ignore the humdrum that way for the rest of the bus ride . \\n▁ it could n't have been more than a ten minute ride , but it felt like hours . \\n▁ when the bus pulled in front of the school and i glanced over at the two girls sitting in the front seat across from me , i realized my mental humming had switched to actual humming and they were regarding me like i was even more of a mental case . \\n▁ i sighed and then shut up . \\n▁ the hydraulics of the bus screeched as it lurked to a stop and the door immediately squeaked open . \\n▁ i flew out of my seat and out that door , wanting to be away from the bad - xxunk behind me before i did something really stupid . \\n▁ a few feet away from the bus , i stopped and stared . \\n▁ sheridan high . \\n▁ not exactly an impressive ivy league school , but it was intimidating the hell out of me anyway . \\n▁ as we lived in what would be considered by most a ` ` rural '' area , the school was n't overly large or overly fancy . \\n▁ it mainly consisted of a boring two - story rectangular building that someone in the architectural world had tried to fancy up with a faandccedil ; ade of brick outlining the double doors of the entryway and underscoring every window . \\n▁ it was n't the most put together work though and on occasion those bricks would chip apart or even come loose and pop off all together . \\n▁ in fact , the third brick from the left , on the bottom fourth window , was frequently used as a spot to store your stash , since that brick was completely removable but still seemed perfectly intact unless you touched it . \\n▁ the brick underneath it had eroded into a concave shape creating a perfect little hole . \\n▁ darren had nabbed a few bags of pot out of there once , probably from some upperclassman that had needed a quick hiding place . \\n▁ it was a pretty discreet spot ; i have no idea how he 'd found out about it . \\n▁ aside from that oddity , the rest of the building was horridly plain . \\n▁ the building next to it was equally austere . \\n▁ it was a xxunk square with faded gray paint and windows large enough for three people to crawl out of at the same time , if they had the desire to , which , i had a feeling i frequently would this year . \\n▁ it was the room we were all shepherded into to eat the food the school district was considering a nutritious lunch . \\n▁ it was also the room where lil and i had kissed for the first time - i mean really kissed ; not the playful , momentary lip on lip action that she loved to give me sporadically throughout the day , even before we were a couple . \\n▁ no , the let 's get down to business and connect on a molecular level kiss . \\n▁ a kiss that had left me breathless and wanting more , and had probably started the whole process of falling for her . \\n▁ i was jostled from behind and snapped out of my painful memories by students meandering through the campus on their way to another year of dreary school life . \\n▁ the rain had stopped on the short ride over , but a dampness clung to the air and i shivered in my jacket . \\n▁ i started walking with the herd , keeping my head down , watching the grass poking up through cracks in the pavement . \\n▁ i adjusted my backpack on my shoulder and thrust my hands in my jeans pockets , for a moment feeling invisible in the school that i was sure was n't excited to see me . \\n▁ that thought was confirmed when from behind me i heard : ` ` hey , douchebag ! '' \\n▁ i do n't know why , but i instinctively turned to look . \\n▁ i probably should n't have , but then again , this was probably going to happen if i looked or not . \\n▁ a rock the size of my thumb whizzed through the air and smacked me right in the temple . \\n▁ focusing so hard on not focusing on anything , i had n't been fast enough to avoid it , and man , it stung . \\n▁ i brought a hand to my head and felt the blood next to my eye . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ ` ` learn some reflexes , xxunk , '' josh sneered at me , standing a few feet away with an assortment of laughing friends around his age . \\n▁ he was wearing a slightly too big letterman 's jacket that matched mine , and i briefly wondered if he 'd finally made the varsity team for football this year ; darren had been helping him for his tryout before the wreck , so we could all be on the team together . \\n▁ pulling my eyes from his clothes , i moved up to his face . \\n▁ his dark eyes danced as he waited for me to get angry and attack him . \\n▁ he 'd probably love that . \\n▁ i knew he blamed me for his brother . \\n▁ i knew he hated me because he assumed , like everyone else , that i 'd been wasted . \\n▁ i turned and walked away . \\n▁ as i was turning , i watched his lean body start to quiver with anger . \\n▁ he was itching for it … bad . \\n▁ ` ` coward ! '' \\n▁ he yelled behind me and i shut my eyes , ignoring him . \\n▁ one more year . \\n▁ i ducked into the main building and immediately turned right . \\n▁ weaving my way through the loitering crowds that had noticed the incident outside and had definitely noticed me now , i tried my best to ignore the hiss of whispers as i walked past various people that i had gone to school with for years . \\n▁ even still , i caught pieces as i hurried along . \\n▁ ` ` did you hear … chugging beers … lillian tried to stop … puking as he got in … never should have … always drunk … loser … '' i made myself ignore the stares and the buzzing current of talk that followed me up the hall , and forcefully shoved the door into the restroom open . \\n▁ feeling my breath start to weaken , i hunched over the sink and rested my head against the cool surface of the mirror . \\n▁ i worked on calming the breath that i could feel getting fainter and fainter . \\n▁ it was like these people i 'd grown up with , suddenly did n't know me at all . \\n▁ i was never the one who got wasted and threw up everywhere . \\n▁ anyone who 'd ever partied with me , at least before that night , would have confirmed that to you in a heartbeat . \\n▁ i was the one that held back , that ` ` reluctantly '' drank and usually stopped at two . \\n▁ it just was n't my thing . \\n▁ it was darren 's . \\n▁ he was the one that loved getting buzzed and usually tried to pull me along for his ride . \\n▁ i generally did n't follow him though . \\n▁ in fact , i 'd only been ` ` drunk '' once in my life … and it had been a bad enough experience that i 'd never felt the need to duplicate it . \\n▁ but these people … you 'd think i was the poster child for substance abuse . \\n▁ i looked up when my lungs felt clearer . \\n▁ the face looking back at me in the mirror was almost unrecognizable to me . \\n▁ not because of the small cut right at the edge of my eyebrow that was leaving a trail of blood nearly down to my cheek . \\n▁ no , the face was foreign because it looked … older ; like a summer of grief and guilt and anger and … everything else , had aged me at least a decade . \\n▁ i splashed some cold water on my face , cringing as it entered my torn skin , and gently wiped away the blood and the trace amount of dirt on me . \\n▁ looking back up at my dripping face , i ran a hand down it and choked back the sudden , overwhelming feeling of absolute despair that had snuck up on me . \\n▁ ` ` are you gon na cry ? '' \\n▁ a soft voice made me spin around and there sitting on the floor at the far end of the room next to the stalls was … a girl . \\n▁ she must be new this year since i 'd never seen her before , and in a school this size , you ran into everyone at least once . \\n▁ she had jet black hair pulled into almost childlike pigtails and was calmly picking at a thread of fabric in her ripped jeans . \\n▁ her eyes , an odd gray color -lrb- odd in relation to her super dark hair -rrb- , regarded mine with a look that was somewhere between amused and concerned . \\n▁ she jerked her thumb towards the door , a silver ring on it flashing in the lights . \\n▁ ` ` i could leave if you want ? '' \\n▁ surprise at seeing a girl in the men 's room , who obviously had been here awhile , lightened my mood . \\n▁ i twisted my lips like i 'd been nowhere near breaking down , which of course i had been . \\n▁ ` ` no , i ' m not going to … cry . \\n▁ guys do n't do that . '' \\n▁ i emphasized ` guys ' just in case she was n't aware she was lurking in the men 's room , although the urinals really could n't have been fooling her . \\n▁ she raised one edge of her lip . \\n▁ ` ` right … '' cocking her head she pointed to where i 'd been injured , a slight red welt was still with me . \\n▁ ` ` what happened , west ? '' \\n▁ i opened my mouth to tell her ` nothing ' when what she 'd called me registered in my brain . \\n▁ i cocked my head right back at her . \\n▁ ` ` how did you know my name ? '' \\n▁ she started laughing and the sound echoed around the tiled room , filling it with a certain merry - like music . \\n▁ she did n't answer me , only shook her head lightly , like i was the cutest , most oblivious thing she 'd ever seen . \\n▁ that 's when it hit me and i ' m sure i must have turned bright red as stupidity flowed right through me . \\n▁ yeah , my name was n't exactly hard to decipher when it was sprawled in four inch high letters across my back . \\n▁ thanks to this damn jacket that every member of the football team wore , as a symbol of unity , or something , everyone within a block of me knew my name . \\n▁ i mentally decided i was n't ever wearing it again . \\n▁ ` ` right … the jacket . '' \\n▁ she laughed a little more as she gazed at me . \\n▁ i noticed her smile was a pleasant one ; it seemed to brighten her face under the blackness of that hair . \\n▁ ` ` so … '' she tried again , ` ` the war wound ? '' \\n▁ she pointed again at my face . \\n▁ i looked away and muttered , ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ i glanced at her still on the floor and thought she looked about to challenge my answer ; pretty bold of her since i did n't know her from adam . \\n▁ a slight smile came to my lips and i relaxed my stance , only then realizing i was even tense . \\n▁ her objection died as she noticed me relax as well . \\n▁ here was one person in the school who was n't looking at me critically , who was n't judging me , did n't hate me . \\n▁ here was one person … who did n't know . \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ at least , not yet . \\n▁ she frowned when she saw my expression change and looked about to question me again , but i beat her to it . \\n▁ ` ` why are you in here ? '' \\n▁ my hand swung around to indicate the room . \\n▁ she shrugged and slid up the wall to stand . \\n▁ her ripped jeans were matched with a long - sleeve shirt and she played absentmindedly with the almost too long sleeves , like she 'd stretched out the fabric from her unconscious habit . \\n▁ she shivered a bit and i noticed she did n't have a jacket . \\n▁ ` ` seemed as good a place as any to hide out . '' \\n▁ she shrugged again . \\n▁ i looked around the room with my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` interesting choice , '' i muttered , as i took in the graffiti on the stalls , the water marks on the ceiling , and the telltale signs along the edge of the floor around the urinals that clearly indicated ` men peed here ' . \\n▁ she laughed again at my look . \\n▁ ` ` it was quiet here . \\n▁ no girls at least . '' \\n▁ a look crossed her features when she said that that i could n't quite place . \\n▁ it quickly left her as her calm look returned . \\n▁ ` ` my name is sawyer … if you were ever going to ask . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh … right , hi . '' \\n▁ i fumbled around for words while the oddity of her name struck me . \\n▁ i wanted to ask , but did n't want to be rude . \\n▁ she sighed , interpreting my odd look , and i realized everyone must ask her . \\n▁ ` ` yes , as is tom and huck . \\n▁ my parents are big twain fans . \\n▁ i suppose it could have been worse . '' \\n▁ she shook her head with annoyance clear in her features . \\n▁ the look made her even cuter and i smiled softly at her reaction to her own name . \\n▁ she sighed again and reached down to grab a faded , olive - colored book bag that did n't look to be holding much of anything . \\n▁ ` ` well , nice chatting with you , west . \\n▁ see ya around this … whopper of a school . '' \\n▁ she opened the door into the much quieter hallway and before she completely disappeared , i called out , ` ` it 's lucas … '' she vanished so fast , i had no idea if she heard me or not . \\n▁ i sighed forlornly . \\n▁ the next time i saw her … she would know . \\n▁ someone in this school would feel it was their duty to warn the new girl about the possible psychopath roaming the halls . \\n▁ a bitter note rang through me unexpectedly . \\n▁ as if they were all perfect , as if none of them had ever gotten behind the wheel when they should n't have - which is n't even what happened to me . \\n▁ hypocrites . \\n▁ i sighed again . \\n▁ it had been nice to have someone look me in the eye when they spoke to me and that laugh … i had n't heard a genuine one in ages . \\n▁ probably since that night . \\n▁ i wiped the remaining water droplets off my face and then , with a long steadying breath , i opened the door - right as the bell rang . \\n▁ damn , now on top of everything else … i was late . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i wanted to run . \\n▁ clearing her throat and sounding like she was on the verge of tears herself , ms . reynolds went on to the next order of business . \\n▁ i hoped it was something mundane , like a change in the dress code or something . \\n▁ it was n't . \\n▁ today was just not my day . \\n▁ ` ` in light of the recent tragedy , the school has decided to implement a much tougher policy on illegal substances . \\n▁ no drugs , no alcohol , no weapons … on or off campus . \\n▁ any offense will result in immediate suspension . \\n▁ a second offense will lead to immediate expulsion . '' \\n▁ a buzz went around the room and i raised my head to stare at her , disbelieving . \\n▁ it was understandable that the school would be tough on that stuff on school grounds , but the school was going to try and stop high schoolers from partying off campus ? \\n▁ because of me ? \\n▁ a few harsh words were muttered and more than a few harsh looks were sent my way . \\n▁ she raised her hand and the buzzing quieted , if not stopped . \\n▁ ` ` now , this is n't to punish , this is to discourage . \\n▁ we want you all to be safe . '' \\n▁ she extended her slim hands to the side , like we were all in this together . \\n▁ i heard a few people mutter my name and swear . \\n▁ ` ` there will also be a safe and sound club starting , to further promote … a more cautious lifestyle . '' \\n▁ her eyes flicked to mine again when she said that and i could tell then , that she believed it too . \\n▁ she thought i 'd been drunk . \\n▁ by her look and tone , she did n't seem to be condemning me for it , mistakes do happen after all , but she believed it , and she was hoping i 'd join this little ` ` purity '' club . \\n▁ my jaw clenched . \\n▁ they 're all so wrong . \\n▁ breathe … in … out . \\n▁ calm down . \\n▁ i glanced over at the new girl , sawyer . \\n▁ she met my eye and her brow furrowed , like she did n't get why i seemed to be repeatedly targeted . \\n▁ i sighed softly ; she would soon enough . \\n▁ ms . reynolds let out a shaky breath and shook her head , a large smile brightening up her almost gloomy face . \\n▁ i noticed a few girls in the room wiping tears off their cheeks and a few guys still muttering about the no substances stance the school was taking . \\n▁ no one looked at me again , but i felt the heat of every non - existent stare . \\n▁ ms . reynolds next words did absolutely nothing to dispel that feeling . \\n▁ ` ` okay , for your first real assignment , i ' m going to go easy on you . \\n▁ just write a two page essay on what you did this summer . \\n▁ simple right ? '' \\n▁ my jaw dropped as i gaped at her . \\n▁ what i did this summer ? \\n▁ i mourned the loss of three of my best friends . \\n▁ i yelled . \\n▁ i cursed god . \\n▁ i cried , no , i sobbed , for countless hours . \\n▁ i went to funerals , where kids and adults alike shunned me . \\n▁ i was alone … in my grief and in my overwhelming guilt . \\n▁ i still was . \\n▁ and she wanted me to … write about that ? \\n▁ her eyes flicked over my face as she scanned the groaning room . \\n▁ they passed over mine again as she looked at all the students and then her head whipped back around to stare at me . \\n▁ ` ` oh … lucas . '' \\n▁ her face paled and her mouth dropped open as what she 'd just asked me to do sank in . \\n▁ her eyes watered and she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to … you can write whatever you want . '' \\n▁ every head in the room turned to stare at me ; most held bitterness , some outright anger , some just curiosity . \\n▁ my breathing got shallow again and i could feel my stomach start to rise . \\n▁ god , i was going to get sick right here in front of everyone . \\n▁ i grabbed my bag and bolted out of my chair . \\n▁ i could n't do it . \\n▁ i could n't calmly sit there anymore . \\n▁ coming today was a bad idea . \\n▁ as our seats had a bar holding up the writing table , you had to get in and out of them the same way , so i had to pass will again . \\n▁ seeing as how he had the maturity level of a five year old , he stuck his foot out again . \\n▁ and since today was really not my day and i was concentrating more on not throwing up or hyperventilating , or some odd mixture of the two , i tripped over his damn foot again . \\n▁ i fell hard , both hands and knees hitting the ground this time . \\n▁ the entire room laughed and my head started to swim . \\n▁ i wanted it to be over with . \\n▁ all i did was make a mistake . \\n▁ all i did was drive poorly and lose control of the car . \\n▁ why did no one believe that ? \\n▁ soft hands helped me up and a voice cooed in my ear . \\n▁ ` ` it 's alright , lucas . \\n▁ everything will be alright . '' \\n▁ my heart stopped . \\n▁ it was lillian 's voice that i 'd heard in my ear . \\n▁ her sweet , musical tone that had driven my heart straight to near imploding with love back when she was alive , and i was hearing it again , hearing it clearly . \\n▁ my head shot up as my legs straightened underneath me . \\n▁ i snapped my head around behind me , fully expecting to see lillian , see her delicate arms under my elbows , helping to steady me . \\n▁ but it was n't lil 's pale hair that filled my vision . \\n▁ no , i was met with black hair . \\n▁ my brows scrunched as i looked back into sawyer 's gray eyes . \\n▁ she had sounded so much like lil . \\n▁ i reached out and grabbed a lock of her hair , ignoring the sound of the class still laughing and ms . reynolds trying , without much luck , to subdue them . \\n▁ her hair was soft but undeniably black . \\n▁ i did n't understand . \\n▁ my eyes watered and obscured vision added to my breathing and stomach problems . \\n▁ ` ` lil ? '' \\n▁ i asked quietly , wondering if i 'd gone completely mad . \\n▁ ` ` come on , '' sawyer 's soft voice responded , not much sounding like lillian at all anymore . \\n▁ she reached behind her to grab her bag off the floor and then shuffled me forward and for a moment , i could n't understand why . \\n▁ when we got to the front , she hastily told ms . reynolds that she was taking me to see the counselor . \\n▁ i wanted to roll my eyes and tell her i was fine . \\n▁ i wanted to go sit back down and yell at everyone that i was fine . \\n▁ i could n't though . \\n▁ i could n't speak and my eyes were really starting to tear up . \\n▁ i 'd just clearly heard my dead girlfriend 's voice . \\n▁ i was n't fine . \\n▁ ms . reynolds nodded and swooshed her arms toward the door , almost looking relieved that i was about to be walking through them . \\n▁ a crumpled up piece of paper hit the back of my head as sawyer opened the door , but i ignored it . \\n▁ i ignored it all and focused on putting one foot in front of the other , while keeping my breaths deep and my stomach down . \\n▁ that was enough to think about . \\n▁ the door shut behind me and i slumped down , putting my hands on my knees and bending over , praying i did n't get sick in front of her . \\n▁ she rubbed a hand on my back while i took embarrassingly big breaths . \\n▁ ` ` are you … alright ? '' \\n▁ she asked hesitantly . \\n▁ i shook my head forcefully . \\n▁ alright ? \\n▁ no , i had n't been that in awhile . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to take you to that counselor person ? '' \\n▁ she adjusted her book bag on her shoulder up over her head so the strap rested across her chest . \\n▁ again i shook my head . \\n▁ no , i did not want to speak with some high school grief counselor . \\n▁ what did they know about being responsible for ending the lives of three people that you loved ? \\n▁ what advice could they possibly give me ? \\n▁ one day at a time . \\n▁ things will get better . \\n▁ time heals all wounds . \\n▁ it was all crap and i did n't want to hear it . \\n▁ ` ` no … i just want … quiet . '' \\n▁ i finally got out between big breaths . \\n▁ she nodded and started pulling me away . \\n▁ confused , i looked around . \\n▁ ` ` what are you … where are we going ? '' \\n▁ she half grinned at me , her pigtails swishing around her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` somewhere quiet . '' \\n▁ she pulled me down to the first floor and for a moment i thought she was going to pull us back into ` ` our '' bathroom . \\n▁ she may have actually been about to do that , but when we reached the last step on the stairs we noticed coach taylor going in there . \\n▁ we both flattened against the wall so he would n't see us . \\n▁ coach had been my mentor in football since i had played junior varsity freshman year . \\n▁ while he was an exceptionally hard and stern man , he 'd always been there for me , supporting me and encouraging me in his drill sergeant sort of way . \\n▁ darren and me both . \\n▁ he 'd been the one to see real potential in me and had worked tirelessly to stoke it . \\n▁ i was n't sure what he believed about the crash … but i was sure i did n't want to find out just yet . \\n▁ sawyer did n't seem to want a run - in with a teacher either , so once the bathroom door closed , she pulled my hand in the opposite direction . \\n▁ she pulled us towards the janitor 's closet and i felt my body tense up . \\n▁ kids made out in there , just like they did in every high school across america . \\n▁ that was n't what was making my already on the edge stomach rise further and twist painfully though . \\n▁ no , i was n't afraid of being in a dark , enclosed space with a pretty girl . \\n▁ i was afraid of the ghosts that awaited me in that room . \\n▁ lil and i had been nearly nak * d in that room before . \\n▁ i know … not romantic , but we 'd been in love and desperate to connect and just … feel each other . \\n▁ that room held the echoes of light moans and memories of soft skin and heated kisses . \\n▁ even without walking into that room , flashes of the encounter filled my head : lil 's shirt dropping to the floor , her bra following , my shirt last to the pile , her sitting me down in a folding chair , her straddling my lap , our bare chests pressed together , my lips on her fragrant skin … fruity , like peaches , her hands snaking between us to unbutton my jeans … i pulled away from sawyer just as her hand reached the knob . \\n▁ she looked back at me surprised , and maybe a little hurt too , but i could n't worry too much about offending her because i was about to lose whatever trace amount of food was in my stomach … and doing it all over her , would most definitely offend her . \\n▁ i bolted out the front door and down the few steps leading up to the building . \\n▁ i just made it to the edge of the stairs when my stomach had had enough . \\n▁ falling to my knees at the beauty bark surrounding a few decorative bushes under the windows … i threw up . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ it was just once , and very quick , but enough to make me feel like a jackass when i sensed sawyer watching from behind me . \\n▁ i silently thanked fate that i was a few feet from the window and had n't just done that in front of a room filled with unsuspecting students . \\n▁ with a shaking hand , i wiped off my mouth and sat back on my heels . \\n▁ after a few calming , deep breaths in the stillness of this cool autumn morning , i turned my head to look at sawyer . \\n▁ i had no idea what she 'd think of that , what she thought of anything about me . \\n▁ if she had pieced together any of the conversations she 'd probably heard this morning , she probably thought i was hung - over and heaving my alcohol soaked guts . \\n▁ looking over at her dark head , tilted slightly to the side , brows slightly bunched together , all i could read from her was concern . \\n▁ still not saying anything , she extended a hand to me . \\n▁ i looked down at the hand , the silver ring upon her thumb that shone even in the faded gray light of this overcast day , and finally reached out to grasp it with my own . \\n▁ her hand was cool , since we were outside , and i noticed then that she still did n't have a jacket and she was shaking lightly . \\n▁ as we stared at each other for a moment , i dropped her hand , shrugged off my jacket and flung it around her shoulders . \\n▁ she started to protest and shrug it back off , although her face seemed reluctant to do so , but i immediately broke off her objections . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want it , '' was all i said . \\n▁ and i did n't want it . \\n▁ i did n't want that reminder of the popular , outgoing , happy - go - lucky guy i used to be . \\n▁ i was n't him anymore and i did n't want to pretend that i was . \\n▁ i never wanted to wear that damn jacket again . \\n▁ she only nodded as she took in the expression on my face and the dead evenness of my tone . \\n▁ she ran her arms through the sleeves and hugged the fabric to her chest , like she had n't worn a coat in so long she 'd almost forgotten how nice it could feel to be warm and cocooned . \\n▁ i shivered a bit in the chill now , but i welcomed it . \\n▁ it woke up my senses , cleared my head , and my lungs indulged in the crisp , damp air as i took long even breaths . \\n▁ she studied me silently for a moment more before quietly saying , ` ` do you want me to take you home ? '' \\n▁ i looked down as i thought about that . \\n▁ did i want to go home ? \\n▁ had i punished myself enough for one day ? \\n▁ i tried to imagine walking back into that building , walking past scores of people i 'd once been friendly with who now , would barely look at me , walking past multiple reminders of the friends i 'd lost … both the living ones and the dead ones . \\n▁ my eyes swelled with more of those horrid tears and looking back up at her i could only say , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ she nodded as her brow scrunched further and her eyes flicked between mine . \\n▁ i still did n't know what she thought of me , but she was the only one showing me an ounce of friendship and compassion and greedily , i was going to take all i could from her before she was swept away from me too . \\n▁ wanting to take her hand again , but not wanting to disrupt her warmth from where she was snuggling in my jacket , i picked up my bag from where it had slipped off my shoulder when i 'd embarrassingly heaved . \\n▁ i slung it over me and shoved my hands in my pockets . \\n▁ simultaneously , we both started walking towards the student parking lot . \\n▁ everyone was inside , filling their heads with vital pieces of information that they would surely need to make it out there in the ` ` real '' world , so we did n't run into anyone . \\n▁ sawyer was quiet on the way there , which i appreciated . \\n▁ she seemed to have taken my earlier request for silence quite literally . \\n▁ we approached an older looking camaro and she slowed and unclipped her bag , removing it from across her chest , underneath my jacket . \\n▁ i smiled at the vintage car while she rummaged around inside the bag for the keys . \\n▁ the car was black with white racing stripes and had definitely seen better days , but it was still pretty cool . \\n▁ darren loved xxunk and had always joked about pimping his geo out with a flaming eagle on the front and a t - top in the roof . \\n▁ i closed my eyes as that remembered conversation flooded through me . \\n▁ he 'd never get his camaro now . \\n▁ a light hand on my shoulder woke me and i looked over to see sawyer , keys in hand , silently comforting me . \\n▁ god , how often had she done that this morning ? \\n▁ i tried to smile , and walked over to the other side of the car , lightly shaking my head . \\n▁ she must think i ' m a nut job . \\n▁ maybe i was . \\n▁ she unlocked her side and got in while i waited . \\n▁ this old car not having electric locks , she reached over the seat and unlocked my side . \\n▁ i got in and stretched out my six - two frame in the black leather , bucket seat . \\n▁ for being rundown looking on the outside , it was well kept on the inside , clean and shiny and lightly smelling of lemon . \\n▁ i smiled at a tiny disco ball hanging from the rear view mirror as she started the car , the growl from the engine the unmistakable purr of a muscle car . \\n▁ she pulled out of the lot silently and i directed her to the general vicinity of my home . \\n▁ we lived off the main artery that led right to the school . \\n▁ all she had to do was keep going straight and right as town started to fall away , she 'd hit our house , the last house before the small trace of city civilization stopped . \\n▁ quite literally ` ` where the sidewalk ends '' . \\n▁ on the drive over , she bit her lip and looked to be barely containing her curiosity . \\n▁ she did n't seem like she was going to cave , but she was fidgeting in her seat and i 'd imagine that if i were her , i 'd have a bazillion questions for this odd boy beside her . \\n▁ ` ` go ahead , '' i said quietly , finally breaking our silence . \\n▁ her words spilled out in a rush , like she 'd barely been restraining them and once i 'd given permission , she could n't hold them back . \\n▁ ` ` the accident everyone keeps mentioning , you were involved in that ? '' \\n▁ she looked over at me and her gray eyes suddenly looked very sorry that she could n't contain her questions . \\n▁ keeping as calm a face as i could , i simply said , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ in my head i prepared my answer for the question everyone asks … ` ` oh … i ' m so sorry . \\n▁ i heard that people died … '' her eyes went back to the road while i tensed , both at her words and where i knew the conversation was heading . \\n▁ do i remember ? \\n▁ was i drunk ? \\n▁ she looked over at me with only her eyes and i felt the question coming . \\n▁ she bit her lip and i opened my mouth to give the answer . \\n▁ ` ` do you … are you okay with this ? '' \\n▁ her hand flashed out to indicate her driving . \\n▁ not expecting her to ask that , my answer for the question i thought she 'd ask spilled from my lips before i could stop it . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she fully looked at me , startled and looking unsure what to do . \\n▁ the car slowed and she started to turn the wheel like she was going to pull over . \\n▁ i shook my head and started sputtering on my words . \\n▁ ` ` no , no , that 's not … i ' m fine . \\n▁ god , i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ i looked over at her , her face looked hopelessly confused . \\n▁ it was sort of an adorable look . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m an idiot … this is fine . \\n▁ i ' m fine . '' \\n▁ she narrowed her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` why did you say no ? '' \\n▁ turning back to the road , her speed increased to normal . \\n▁ i exhaled heavily - because i ' m a moron . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't think … i was n't expecting you to ask that . \\n▁ people always ask … something else . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' she said quietly . \\n▁ ` ` what did you think i was going to ask ? '' \\n▁ i sighed and looked out the window , the houses were getting farther apart ; we were reaching the end of town and the end of this weird car ride . \\n▁ ` ` if i remembered it . '' \\n▁ i whispered my words into the glass of the window beside me . \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' was her quiet response . \\n▁ after a few moments of silence she said , ` ` i would n't ask that . '' \\n▁ i looked back at her , surprised ; most people were dying to know what i knew . \\n▁ since i never talked about it , there was only speculation about the wreck , and most of that was wrong . \\n▁ she shrugged her shoulders as she looked at my face and then back out the window . \\n▁ ` ` you either do n't … which is fine , or you do … which must be horrible . '' \\n▁ she looked over at me again . \\n▁ ` ` either way … why would i want you to think about that awful moment again ? '' \\n▁ she scrunched her brow like she was angry . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m the idiot . \\n▁ i should n't have even brought it up . '' \\n▁ her eyes turned back to the road . \\n▁ ` ` sorry . '' \\n▁ i nearly laughed . \\n▁ she was sorry … for asking me about what everyone was surely whispering about today ? \\n▁ i was the town gossip . \\n▁ i was so used to everyone trying to pry their nose into my business and my personal life that it was nearly astounding to me that one person on this earth , not only did n't want to know , but felt guilty for even bringing the topic up . \\n▁ i could have kissed her . \\n▁ i smiled genuinely and relaxed back into my seat . \\n▁ ` ` do n't worry about it . \\n▁ i did say you could ask . '' \\n▁ a tiny laugh did escape me then and she looked over at me oddly . \\n▁ i really must seem a mental case to her . \\n▁ we drove the rest of the way in a comfortable silence and i pointed at my house when we approached it . \\n▁ the house was nothing spectacular , a basic one - story , three bedroom rambler with fading blue paint and a mailbox that would n't ever stay completely closed . \\n▁ she pulled into the empty driveway and stopped the car , but did n't turn it off . \\n▁ i looked over at her as i put my hand on the door . \\n▁ her presence was so calming to me i was almost reluctant to give it up . \\n▁ being alone right now , while better than being at school , was n't exactly going to be an easy thing - i had too many ghosts in my head today . \\n▁ ` ` do you … '' i pointed again to the house , indicating the white door with three tiny windows inlaid at the top of it . \\n▁ ` ` do you want to come in ? '' \\n▁ she looked me over with a tiny smile on her lips , her hands never coming off the steering wheel . \\n▁ she seemed about to fully smile and i thought for sure she 'd say yes and move to shut the car off , but instead her near smile turned into a frown and she shook her head lightly , her pig tails swishing adorably . \\n▁ ` ` no , i ca n't . '' \\n▁ i frowned then too and noticing my expression she quickly added , ` ` do n't get me wrong , i wish i could , but my parents … '' she rolled her eyes and sighed , ` ` they 're sort of on the rampage and they 'd have my ass if i skipped school today . '' \\n▁ she gave me a wry look . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sort of on probation . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' i said quietly . \\n▁ i was curious why , but one thing that i 'd learned over the past few months was not to pry . \\n▁ if she wanted to say more , she would . \\n▁ i did n't need to force her to . \\n▁ she bit her lip as she watched me , almost seeming worried that i would ask . \\n▁ she visibly relaxed when i shrugged and said , ` ` well , thank you for the ride . '' \\n▁ i looked down and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` and for not giving me too much crap over flipping out . '' \\n▁ i looked back up at her when i felt her hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ it was small , but warm , and that warmth seeped into my skin through my light t - shirt . \\n▁ ` ` it 's alright . \\n▁ you seemed to be having quite a morning . '' \\n▁ her hand drifted down my arm to touch my hand , the warmth following it . \\n▁ ` ` people do n't seem to like you too much … '' she was quiet when she said that and it seemed more a casual observance than an outright question . \\n▁ she 'd been so nice to me today that i felt the need to answer it though . \\n▁ ` ` they do n't … they blame me . '' \\n▁ i looked out the window and my hand tightened on the door handle . \\n▁ ` ` they think i got behind the wheel with my friends while i was out of my mind drunk , and then drove recklessly , killing them all . \\n▁ they think i forced them into the car , forced them to ride with me . \\n▁ they practically think i ' m a monster . '' \\n▁ my voice had turned hard and rough in my sudden anger . \\n▁ no one understood what happened . \\n▁ none of them at that school believed me when i said i was sober . \\n▁ none of them . \\n▁ sawyer gasped beside me in a way that almost sounded pained . \\n▁ i turned to look at her and clearly saw the pain in her features . \\n▁ i was confused for a moment until her other hand came up and forcibly relaxed the grip i had on the hand that had been resting on mine earlier . \\n▁ i flinched and retracted it . \\n▁ somewhere in my heated speech , i must have clenched her hand … hard . \\n▁ i 'd hurt her . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , '' i muttered . \\n▁ she laughed a little and rubbed out her palm . \\n▁ ` ` it 's alright . '' \\n▁ her laughter loosened my sudden anger and i added , ` ` that 's not what happened . \\n▁ i did lose control … but that 's not what happened . '' \\n▁ this was the closest i 'd come to admitting to anyone that i remembered . \\n▁ sure , i told everyone that i had n't been drinking at the party , but the actual wreck ? \\n▁ i glossed over that with feigned amnesia . \\n▁ she stopped laughing and cocked her head while she regarded me . \\n▁ the silence in the car seemed to thicken and swirl around us , but it was n't oppressive or clingy . \\n▁ like her hand , it was warm and comforting . \\n▁ i still held my breath though . \\n▁ i could see the debate in her eyes ; she was judging my character based on all she 'd seen and heard , and was deciding in this moment , if i was guilty of the crime the others had already convicted me of . \\n▁ finally she opened her mouth to speak , and my body tensed in preparation for her condemnation . \\n▁ it had been so nice to have someone who looked at me differently . \\n▁ i dropped my head as her speech finally made it passed her lips . \\n▁ ` ` i believe you , '' was all she said . \\n▁ i slumped my shoulders until what she 'd said registered , then my head shot up and my surprised face looked over her serene one . \\n▁ ` ` you believe me … why ? '' \\n▁ no one else did , people who had known me for years , grown up with me . \\n▁ why would this complete stranger believe me , when they did n't ? \\n▁ that faint smile lit her face again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve gotten to be a pretty good judge of character and … '' she shrugged , ` ` i think you ' ve got a pretty good one . \\n▁ if you say it did n't happen the way people gossip about , then i believe you . \\n▁ i believe it was just an accident . '' \\n▁ i stared back at her , speechless . \\n▁ i felt my eyes watering and worked on controlling back the stubborn tears . \\n▁ just an accident . \\n▁ it sounded so simple that way . \\n▁ yes , i suppose in the very simplest of terms , it was just an accident , an accident that could have happened to anyone that night . \\n▁ accidents do happen … did happen . \\n▁ but it happened to me and that changes things . \\n▁ it had happened to me and my friends were dead because of it . \\n▁ that was all that mattered . \\n▁ while it would be nice if the town believed me and while it was exceptionally nice that sawyer did believe me … truly it was irrelevant . \\n▁ drunk or not , sober or not , none of that really mattered … they were still dead . \\n▁ that was my truth . \\n▁ i did n't say any of that to her though , i only nodded and finally opened the door . \\n▁ she leaned over the seat and called out after me as i stepped out of the vehicle . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ i bent down and popped my head back inside , the lemon smell of her car battling with the putrid smell of the garbage can on the sidewalk . \\n▁ she started to wriggle out of my jacket . \\n▁ ` ` here … you can take this back . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i do n't want it . '' \\n▁ i repeated my earlier phrase and she stopped mid - wriggle to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` keep it , '' i said quietly . \\n▁ she looked confused by that , and a tad relieved , like she had n't really wanted to give up her warmth . \\n▁ i nodded at her and quickly shut the door before she could protest further . \\n▁ i walked up to my front step to prepare myself for an afternoon of pitying , and most likely crying , when i heard her car start to pull away . \\n▁ i turned at the door and watched her wave from the window as she backed into the street and then drove away , towards school . \\n▁ see you around bathroom girl . \\n▁ well , my first day had n't been great , but i suppose it could have been worse . \\n▁ i could have thrown up on sawyer . \\n▁ there 's that . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; god , i miss you , lil . \\n▁ after awhile i showered and got dressed for the day . \\n▁ i was n't even going to bother trying to get back to sleep . \\n▁ i did n't want to dream about her again … and i desperately did want to dream about her again . \\n▁ but school was in a couple of hours anyway . \\n▁ any dream i would have had , would ' ve been a short one , and if i was going to see her that way again , i wanted as much time as possible . \\n▁ god , what a messed up thought : to sleep , perchance to dream … but only if you ' ve got the time to commit to it . \\n▁ sighing , i made a pot of coffee . \\n▁ mom frowned on me drinking the stuff , but like a lot of things in my life lately , she let it slide . \\n▁ it was almost as if i had a permanent ` ` get out of jail free '' card . \\n▁ she let me get away with doing things i 'd never have gotten away with before . \\n▁ cutting school , for instance . \\n▁ if it was last year and i 'd done that , she 'd have had my head . \\n▁ of course , if it were last year , i 'd be cutting to go get into trouble with darren . \\n▁ a lot can change in a year . \\n▁ i thought over my friend as i grabbed the pot of thick , black and incredibly strong coffee -lrb- once i 'd decided to start drinking it , i had n't messed around and went right for the hard stuff -rrb- . \\n▁ his joking face popped into my head easier than it had in awhile ; maybe seeing lil had sharpened his memory in me as well . \\n▁ i could clearly see his quick to light with mischief brown eyes and unruly , dark brown hair , that was always sticking up somewhere , even though sammy was continually trying to press it flat , which usually made him grunt in mock exasperation and playfully push her mothering hands away . \\n▁ i pictured him leaning back in my kitchen , arms crossed over his chest , frowning at me and shaking his head . \\n▁ ` ` come on , lucas - blow off class with me today . '' \\n▁ i smiled at the remembered conversation we 'd had months ago . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't , darren . \\n▁ i have a math test first period . '' \\n▁ he rolled his eyes and shook his head again . \\n▁ ` ` so … xxunk , luc ! \\n▁ freakin ' xxunk ! \\n▁ let 's go blow some shit up ! '' \\n▁ his eyes lit up at the prospect . \\n▁ even though he was two months older than me , sometimes he seemed about three years younger . \\n▁ he and josh had scored the fireworks … somewhere . \\n▁ they were always finding … questionable entertainment . \\n▁ i smiled wider . \\n▁ ` ` we will . \\n▁ i 'll meet you after school . '' \\n▁ his normally happy face darkened a bit and he twisted his lips in clear displeasure about something . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't after school . \\n▁ josh wants to come too and he 's still grounded . \\n▁ he has to go right home after school , and mom would have my head if i did n't take him . '' \\n▁ i 'd never asked what josh had done -lrb- he was constantly getting grounded for something -rrb- , so i had no idea now , why that had been an issue . \\n▁ but apparently , josh missing class would n't bring wrath down on darren , so he 'd been all for that plan . \\n▁ of course , with those two , forging notes had become almost an art form . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll meet up with you guys at lunch , okay ? \\n▁ we 'll blow some shit up then . '' \\n▁ i almost felt like laughing when i remembered what we 'd ended up blowing up . \\n▁ darren had swiped a garden gnome from his neighbor 's house and the poor concrete bastard had met its maker down by the river . \\n▁ darren 's neighbor had asked his parents for weeks if they 'd seen that thing . \\n▁ luckily for darren , they 'd never found out … although , i suppose it did n't matter now . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ the vision of darren , nodding at my suggestion and growing animatedly excited over what we could do , suddenly vanished from my sight at the sound of my mother 's voice . \\n▁ i turned my head , my hand still clenched around the full coffee pot , ready to pour it into my cup . \\n▁ i realized that , to her , i 'd just been standing still at the counter holding a pot of coffee and doing nothing for … god knows how long . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ i nodded as she walked completely into our small kitchen . \\n▁ the room basically consisted of a stove next to a dishwasher next to a small sink next to a fridge . \\n▁ somewhere in that cramped space , they had thrown in a little counter room , just enough for the coffee pot . \\n▁ the other wall of the room had a narrow rectangle of a table with only two chairs , one for her and one for me , underneath a large window that overlooked our driveway . \\n▁ after giving me a quick hug and a look - over , she sat down in the chair traditionally held as hers . \\n▁ i poured a mug for her automatically . \\n▁ as per usual , she did n't delve any further into what i 'd been thinking , giving me my space . \\n▁ by what even i knew was a solemn look on my face , she had to of known anyway . \\n▁ there were really only three things i ever thought much about : sammy , darren and lillian . \\n▁ either of the three would cause her , and myself , a handful of pain , so i did n't go into any details . \\n▁ i poured a mug for myself and joined her at the table . \\n▁ neither of us ate anything ; we 'd never much had the stomach for food before ten in the morning . \\n▁ we were n't what you 'd call ` ` breakfast people . '' \\n▁ mom was dressed and ready for her first job of the day , her hair in an orderly ponytail that i knew would be falling apart by lunchtime . \\n▁ she was dressed in jeans and a uniformed polo shirt with ` andy 's hardware ' in the upper left corner . \\n▁ she worked there until five and then she switched clothes , sometimes in her station wagon , and headed out to the diner . \\n▁ she had taken a job at a hardware store , not just to make sure we got by , but also so she 'd be knowledgeable in home repair and maintenance . \\n▁ she 'd completely depended on a man once in her life and she did n't want to ever have to do that again . \\n▁ she 'd taught me everything she had learned over the years . \\n▁ i learned a lot from my mom . \\n▁ feeling her eyes drinking me in again , i brought up a topic that i thought might bring her a small amount of cheer . \\n▁ it had certainly been the only bright spot in my day yesterday . \\n▁ my lips curled into a tight , contained smile . \\n▁ ` ` i met a girl yesterday . '' \\n▁ her eyes widened at that , before they returned to normal . \\n▁ her face took on an expression of weariness and happiness . \\n▁ i liked seeming the latter if not the former . \\n▁ mom knew that when i said , ` ` i met a girl '' , i meant it in only the most literal way it could be taken . \\n▁ there were no potential love interests for me . \\n▁ not right now . \\n▁ not when my heart was lying in a cold , dark … mom interrupted my swirling thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` oh , did you ? '' \\n▁ she sighed softly , as she looked over my face again . \\n▁ i coughed and made myself cheer up for her . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , in the bathroom . '' \\n▁ i leaned in conspiratorially . \\n▁ ` ` the men 's bathroom . '' \\n▁ mom laughed . \\n▁ it was short and seemed a little rusty from being unused for so long , but it had been genuine and the smile on my face was suddenly as real as that laugh had been . \\n▁ ` ` sounds like an interesting girl . '' \\n▁ i thought over the encounter and nodded as i took a long draw from my potent coffee . \\n▁ ` ` that she is . '' \\n▁ my smile again was genuine and my mom noticed it and cocked an eyebrow before letting her face relax into neutrality . \\n▁ she did n't want to get her hopes up that i 'd moved on . \\n▁ either that , or she was struggling with me moving on as well . \\n▁ she 'd loved lil too . \\n▁ ` ` does this bathroom girl have a name ? '' \\n▁ i let out a soft laugh at my mom using the same nickname i 'd used ; my laugh was a little rusty too . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer . '' \\n▁ mom raised her eyebrows and i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , like tom sawyer . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` her parents are fans . '' \\n▁ mom laughed again and i delighted in the rare sound , happy that i had given her a reason to produce it . \\n▁ in a thoughtful voice , i added , ` ` she 's new this year and she was really … kind to me yesterday . '' \\n▁ mom 's laughter ended as she took in my tone of voice and the look on my face . \\n▁ mom heard the gossip too , and could probably guess how my day had actually gone . \\n▁ someone showing me an ounce of warmth would have been held in high regard in her eyes . \\n▁ they started to water now as she , for the seemingly hundredth time this morning , looked me over . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad , lucas , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i nodded and we both went back to quietly sipping our caffeine . \\n▁ after long , silent moments , when my mug was finally empty , i stood , gave her a kiss on the head , and left to grab my backpack . \\n▁ i also grabbed a plain , gray jacket that had been buried in the back of the coat closet . \\n▁ mom stood and watched me from the kitchen entryway . \\n▁ her eyes took in the absence of my letterman 's jacket , but she did n't ask where it went . \\n▁ its absence , along with mine , must have filled in a lot of the blanks for her , on what really went down at school . \\n▁ she sighed and offered me a ride again , which i declined , again . \\n▁ she wished me luck and told me she loved me and i returned both sentiments to her . \\n▁ then she hugged me and we parted ways for the day . \\n▁ i headed outside to walk the couple miles to school . \\n▁ it was early and i had the time today . \\n▁ it was also still overcast , but this morning was dry , and it seemed like it was going to stay that way . \\n▁ and really , even if it were pouring , i 'd rather walk a few miles in a downpour , than hop on that damn bus again . \\n▁ the walk to school was long and a touch monotonous . \\n▁ i found my mind blanking out as i counted the cracks in the pavement . \\n▁ it did stay dry on me , and at the three thousandth , four hundredth and fifty - second crack , i finally arrived back at sheridan high . \\n▁ it was early still , and only a couple bodies were milling around the school . \\n▁ i did n't look to see if they noticed me . \\n▁ instead , i immediately made my way up to the main building and up the stairs to my english class . \\n▁ the room was empty as i went to take my seat at the desk i sat in yesterday . \\n▁ i glanced around at the twenty or so other desks , all empty and awaiting their occupants , those students still on their way to school or eating breakfast , or possibly even still sleeping . \\n▁ for a second , i remembered that sammy was supposed to be in this class with me . \\n▁ the four of us last year had worked out our schedules so that one or all of us would have a class together . \\n▁ it had ended up with just sammy and me in this first period . \\n▁ lillian had been really excited that her best friend was going to be in a class with me again . \\n▁ her ` ` plant '' as she put it , to subtly remind me of birthdays , holidays and our anniversary . \\n▁ what it would have ended up being , was what last year 's geometry class had ended up being - sammy digging out secrets on darren from me . \\n▁ i pictured sammy in the seat in front of me , twisting around to grin at me , her auburn hair dangling over her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` so , luc … seriously , what did darren say about … our night ? '' \\n▁ i blushed and rolled my eyes , as i remembered her asking me about a very private conversation i 'd had with darren after their ` ` first '' time . \\n▁ ` ` sammy … i ' m not talking about that with you . '' \\n▁ she leaned over her chair , smiling even wider . \\n▁ ` ` come on , you have to tell me , luc . \\n▁ i know he talked to you about it ; he talks to you about everything . \\n▁ so … what did he say ? '' \\n▁ a tiny frown drew down the corners of her mouth . \\n▁ ` ` was it bad ? \\n▁ did he not … like it ? '' \\n▁ i gave her my best ` are you kidding ' face . \\n▁ ` ` he 's a guy … of course he liked it . '' \\n▁ her corresponding grin was brilliant , and her eyes sparkled with merriment . \\n▁ ` ` ha ! \\n▁ i knew he talked to you . '' \\n▁ i sighed over getting trapped in her questioning , while she laughed and begged for details . \\n▁ i looked around the room with my eyes and then leaned forward ; she leaned towards me as well . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't tell him i said anything , he 'd kill me . '' \\n▁ she made a quick pledge with her fingers and i sighed , wondering how i 'd gotten sucked up into girl gossip … again . \\n▁ ` ` he said it was amazing … like , the best thing he 'd ever experienced . '' \\n▁ her eyes misted over as she bit her lip . \\n▁ i shrugged , getting a little uncomfortable . \\n▁ ` ` he said he loved you even more . '' \\n▁ i cringed a bit as she looked about ready to squeal with girl delight . \\n▁ ` ` is that enough ? \\n▁ can we not talk about this again … ever ? '' \\n▁ she grinned and nodded , then leaned forward further and kissed my forehead . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , luc ! \\n▁ god , you 're the best ! '' \\n▁ i shook my head at her and smiled warmly at the beautiful girl that had my friend 's heart . \\n▁ her auburn hair framed the cutest , heart shaped face with brown eyes so light they were almost gold . \\n▁ those eyes were always so full of love and laughter . \\n▁ she rarely ever had a down day . \\n▁ she was so darn happy , she was almost bubbly , but never in an obnoxious way . \\n▁ just in a way that made you want to be around her . \\n▁ her zest for life , made you want to have that zest too . \\n▁ i missed that … ` ` good morning , lucas . '' \\n▁ i blinked out of my memory and looked up at the teacher 's desk where ms . reynolds was setting down a stack of papers . \\n▁ ` ` good morning , ms . reynolds . '' \\n▁ she sat on the edge of her desk and crossed her arms over her chest . \\n▁ on a normal day , i 'd notice that her legs were long and lean under that tight skirt she wore , but i had n't noticed stuff like that in awhile . \\n▁ she gave me a soft repentant smile . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry about yesterday . \\n▁ that was … '' she sighed softly . \\n▁ ` ` this is going to be an adjustment period for everyone , lucas . \\n▁ things will get better . '' \\n▁ i nodded , but said nothing . \\n▁ i suppose things would get better . \\n▁ i mean , how could they possibly get worse ? \\n▁ she bit her lip and cocked her head as she looked me over . \\n▁ i wondered what i looked like to her . \\n▁ did she see the out of control , troubled teen that the students made me out to be , or did she only see a teen that had made a horrible mistake ? \\n▁ either way , i knew she saw me as guilty , and that closed up my throat and i could only watch her , watch me . \\n▁ finally she spoke . \\n▁ ` ` did the counselor help ? '' \\n▁ i paused , debating if i should be truthful . \\n▁ that almost made me chuckle . \\n▁ being truthful in this town , did n't seem to matter much . \\n▁ not wanting to go into any details with her , i only nodded again . \\n▁ she sighed and looked like she desperately wanted to get me talking to her , but had no idea how to do that . \\n▁ i did n't either and remained silent . \\n▁ an almost awkward silence built up in the room as we watched each other . \\n▁ it was finally ended by the arrival of a few more students . \\n▁ ms . reynolds straightened as they entered the class and greeted each of them by name . \\n▁ her face relaxed into a pleasant smile as more students came in and were greeted . \\n▁ she did seem to really love her job , i just made her uncomfortable . \\n▁ understandable , i suppose . \\n▁ the students ignored me as they settled into their seats . \\n▁ well , most of them ignored me . \\n▁ a couple stared openly and one or two glared , but i ignored it , and eventually they ignored me . \\n▁ i stared down at my desk as randy and will arrived together . \\n▁ i heard their deep laughter and felt their heavy steps , as the linebacker and now - quarterback walked to their seats . \\n▁ i heard my name , followed by more laughter , and felt my cheeks heat . \\n▁ i was sure they were laughing over my repeated falls yesterday . \\n▁ oh , and fleeing the room . \\n▁ i definitely had n't earned any cool points . \\n▁ oh well , today would be better . \\n▁ well , today at least , i would n't be fleeing … hopefully . \\n▁ they sat heavily in their chairs , the metal scraping against the floor as their bulk shifted the desks . \\n▁ i glanced up and watched them bump fists in a show of camaraderie and friendship . \\n▁ last year , i would have been included in that ritual while they 'd jokingly ask when i 'd break up with lillian , so will could date her . \\n▁ he 'd had a huge crush on her from nearly day one . \\n▁ i suppose that only added to the reasons why he did n't like me . \\n▁ i stared back down at my desk and reveled in the silence of everyone ignoring me . \\n▁ it was better than questions , better than accusations and much better than being near - bullied . \\n▁ i was still staring at my desk , when i felt a body sit in the chair next to mine . \\n▁ i glanced over at sawyer sitting beside me . \\n▁ her long , black hair was straight down her back today and covered the large letters of my name on the letterman 's jacket she was still wearing . \\n▁ i was a little surprised that she was still wearing it . \\n▁ maybe she did n't have any other jacket ? \\n▁ she did appear to be wearing the same ripped and faded jeans . \\n▁ with all the alienation tied to me at this school , i 'd think she 'd want to avoid associating herself with me , and my name on her back would certainly do that . \\n▁ good thing her hair covered it , i guess . \\n▁ i looked back down to my desk , but looked over again at hearing her soft voice . \\n▁ ` ` hi , lucas . '' \\n▁ i smiled slightly as i watched her gray eyes flick over my face , judging my mood today , perhaps wondering if i 'd be making another run for the border . \\n▁ ` ` hey , sawyer . '' \\n▁ she glanced up at the jocks a few seats in front of us and then back to me . \\n▁ ` ` how … are you ? '' \\n▁ i looked down as i checked my emotional temperature . \\n▁ how was i ? \\n▁ how was i ever these days ? \\n▁ barely holding on by a thread … waiting for the next catastrophe to strike … haunted by images of my friends and girlfriend … ` ` i ' m fine , '' i whispered . \\n▁ from the corner of my eye , i watched her hand start to raise and come towards me . \\n▁ my nerves shot right up to my chest at the thought of her placing a comforting palm on my shoulder . \\n▁ i had enjoyed her xxunk yesterday , and a part of me wanted that again today . \\n▁ another part of me wanted to get through this on my own and , for the moment , i listened to that part . \\n▁ i twisted in my chair to face her and she hastily brought the hand reaching out for me up to her hair , tucking a piece behind her ear . \\n▁ i mentally cringed at the absence of her touch , but threw on a tiny smile for her benefit . \\n▁ ` ` how was the rest of your first day yesterday ? '' \\n▁ she did n't look to buy my fake smile , but she did n't press me on it either . \\n▁ instead , she sighed and rolled her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` boring . \\n▁ standard high school stuff … clicks and cliches . '' \\n▁ she said the last part quietly . \\n▁ i frowned as i looked over her face , her eyes suddenly on her desk , her teeth worrying at her lip . \\n▁ something had happened yesterday to her after i left . \\n▁ it hoped it had nothing to do with the fact that she 'd left with me . \\n▁ maybe she 'd been associated with me already and she 'd been ostracized for it . \\n▁ in some ways , this microcosm of a world could be exceedingly cruel to newcomers . \\n▁ it had n't been that way for lil last year , but she 'd fallen in with our crowd almost instantly and , even though it sounds horribly conceited to say it , darren , sammy and i. . . \\n▁ well , we were kind of at the focal point of the popular crowd . \\n▁ we were sort of the ruling class at the school , and when lil had joined our ranks , especially when she and i had started dating , the school had practically worshipped her . \\n▁ but it could also go the exact opposite of that , and from the expression on sawyer 's face , i was starting to think that that 's how her day had gone . \\n▁ ` ` hey , do you - '' i started to ask her about it , when the bell suddenly rang . \\n▁ the students loitering around their friend 's desks found their seats and a few more trickled in from the hallway . \\n▁ there was a restrained shifting in chairs as people prepared themselves for another day of fascinating learning . \\n▁ i watched sawyer for a few more seconds as she studied her desk . \\n▁ suddenly her eyes came up to meet mine and i saw something in that visual contact - an almost unshakable feeling that she and i were connected , that she and i were the same . \\n▁ i smiled and nodded at her , no longer feeling the need to ask her about how her day had gone . \\n▁ it was n't necessary . \\n▁ i understood that her day had gone badly , just as she understood that mine had gone badly , and i would n't press her , anymore than she 'd press me . \\n▁ i almost wanted to reach out and hold her hand . \\n▁ to be physically connected to her while we were visually connected . \\n▁ i did n't though . \\n▁ we were too far apart for that to be a hidden maneuver , and the last thing i wanted to bring her , was more gossip . \\n▁ we stared at each other for a few moments longer and then pulled our gazes away as ms . reynolds started class . \\n▁ aside from a few pointed looks thrown my way , the class went by with no horrid moments . \\n▁ everyone turned in their papers on their summer and i handed in the paper that i had managed to write in one of calmer moments last night . \\n▁ i 'd written it on ` the plight of the single mother ' . \\n▁ it was as far away from my own personal hell as i could get , but close enough to home to mean something to me . \\n▁ it seemed the right thing to do . \\n▁ after class , i hesitated at my desk until the majority of the room filed out . \\n▁ feeling better about the day , since i 'd made it a full hour here , i had no desire for that to be ruined by will and his childish form of torment . \\n▁ as i thought back to him stuffing freshmen in lockers and dunking ` ` unpopular '' kids in garbage cans last year , i started to wonder why he and i had even been friends at all . \\n▁ was it an inevitability to become friends with the people in your same social circle , even if those people were sort of … dicks ? \\n▁ something to analyze later , i guess . \\n▁ maybe in my third period philosophy class . \\n▁ but for now , i had to get to history . \\n▁ i slung my backpack over my shoulder and smiled at sawyer , who was waiting for the class to file out with me , or maybe as well as me . \\n▁ she smiled back . \\n▁ ` ` congratulations , west , you made it through an entire class . '' \\n▁ i laughed and marveled that that was the second time today i 'd done that , and both times was because of her . \\n▁ ` ` yes , thank you … '' i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` what is your last name ? '' \\n▁ i smiled again as a thought struck me . \\n▁ ` ` is it finn ? \\n▁ because that would just be awesome . '' \\n▁ she scowled and i laughed again at the cute look on her face . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she finally laughed as well and rolled her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` it 's smith . '' \\n▁ my laughter died out as new students started arriving in the classroom . \\n▁ ` ` well , thank you , smith . '' \\n▁ i indicated the door . \\n▁ ` ` shall we ? '' \\n▁ she smiled crookedly at my gallantry and then headed down her aisle and out of the room . \\n▁ once in the hallway , i asked her what her next class was . \\n▁ ` ` science … chemistry . '' \\n▁ she frowned , not looking very excited by the prospect . \\n▁ i frowned too , wishing she 'd said history . \\n▁ chemistry would put her in the long rectangular building behind this main building . \\n▁ it housed the science and astronomy classes . \\n▁ my history class was on the first floor . \\n▁ just as i was wondering if i should walk her to class anyway , she looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` what 's your next class ? '' \\n▁ i sighed dramatically . \\n▁ ` ` history … blah . '' \\n▁ she grinned at my exaggerated expression . \\n▁ ` ` do n't knock history , it 's very important . '' \\n▁ suddenly her face got overly serious for a teenage girl . \\n▁ ` ` you know what they say about it . '' \\n▁ i cocked my head as i watched her face . \\n▁ i sort of knew what they said about it … something about learning from it , or you 're destined to repeat it . \\n▁ i opened my mouth to ask her what the quote was , but she started looking around and muttered , ` ` i got ta go . '' \\n▁ she indicated the first floor doors that led to the science building ; i had n't realized , walking with her , that we 'd made it back to the first floor already . \\n▁ ` ` okay , maybe we 'll have another class together today . '' \\n▁ she grinned , like she already knew the answer to that , and i suppose she already did , since she 'd sat through a day of attendance already and would have heard my name spouted repeatedly at my absence , if we did have any more classes . \\n▁ by her look , i was guessing we did . \\n▁ i wonder which one ? \\n▁ i was debating over sawyer 's odd look as i entered the classroom . \\n▁ thinking about her expression when she 'd made that comment about history , had stopped me from thinking about my own situation . \\n▁ as i was greeted by a roomful of silent stares , i suddenly remembered it . \\n▁ sweeping the room , i noticed that at least none of my football team was here … perhaps i would n't get tripped today . \\n▁ i shook my head slightly as i made my way to my seat . \\n▁ i really should n't think of it as my team anymore . \\n▁ i had n't gone to tryouts over the summer … for obvious reasons , and the team was already well established for the year , a couple months into practices already . \\n▁ i had nearly expected coach to call me about joining the team anyway , but he had n't and it would n't matter if he did . \\n▁ that life was n't important to me anymore . \\n▁ i did n't want it . \\n▁ i took a seat in the back of class and ignored the stares around me . \\n▁ as the bell rang and the teacher stirred from the near asleep position at his desk , i felt eyes on the right side of me . \\n▁ a couple girls were staring at me relentlessly - and not just the curious or baleful stares i was used to getting . \\n▁ no , these two held … determined stares , and i mentally sighed . \\n▁ here we go again . \\n▁ ` ` lucas , '' one whispered . \\n▁ i looked over at the strawberry blonde and recognized her as eliza wood . \\n▁ darren had had a crush on her in the fifth grade . \\n▁ she 'd dated him for a day and then left him for a sixth grader ; he 'd been crushed . \\n▁ i smiled at the memory but did n't show it on my face . \\n▁ i only glanced over at her while the teacher went about prepping class , writing something in large letters on the white board , the smell of dry erase markers suddenly filling the small room . \\n▁ eliza looked up at the teacher and then back to her friend . \\n▁ i recognized the short latino girl too - xxunk hernandez . \\n▁ sammy had once nearly socked the girl for spreading rumors about darren sleeping with her . \\n▁ it was the only time i 'd ever seen sammy really mad . \\n▁ darren had found the whole thing , well , his words were ` ` effing hot '' . \\n▁ eliza leaned towards me and i suppressed the urge to lean away . \\n▁ ` ` so … luc , tell us … what do you remember ? '' \\n▁ she raised her eyebrows expectantly , like i was suddenly going to lean into her and confess all of my innermost secrets . \\n▁ i resisted every urge in my body to scowl and tell her to f * * k off . \\n▁ i exhaled slowly and looked back down to my desk . \\n▁ i did n't talk about this , to anyone . \\n▁ i 'd never said anything to my mom . \\n▁ i 'd never said anything at the hospital . \\n▁ i 'd never even said anything to the cops . \\n▁ i had nothing to say to anyone , except , what i was about to say to the nosey girl beside me . \\n▁ ` ` nothing , eliza . \\n▁ i remember nothing . '' \\n▁ she sighed xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` oh come on , luc , no one believes that . \\n▁ i mean , how do you forget something like that ? '' \\n▁ xxunk popped up beside her . \\n▁ ` ` right , that should be like , seared in your brain or something . '' \\n▁ i clenched my jaw as her tone got thoughtful . \\n▁ ` ` unless … you were just too wasted to remember ? \\n▁ that makes sense . '' \\n▁ i glared up at them as they nodded to each other knowingly . \\n▁ ` ` i was not drinking ! '' \\n▁ my tone was heated … and a little louder than was necessary . \\n▁ every head in the room swung around to me and i felt my cheeks flush . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ ` ` lucas west . '' \\n▁ the teacher , mr . davis , a graying man with thick glasses and a wide stomach , looked down at me from the front of class . \\n▁ crossing his arms over his chest he practically glared at me while eliza and xxunk giggled quietly . \\n▁ ` ` so glad you could join us today . \\n▁ how about keeping it down while you 're here ? '' \\n▁ he raised an eyebrow at me and i quickly looked back to my desk , blocking out the amused voices in the room . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sir . '' \\n▁ i usually did n't say ` ` sir '' to teachers , but it was an easy way to slip back into their good graces and really , i just wanted to sit here and quietly disappear . \\n▁ the girls snickered beside me , but did n't ask anymore questions . \\n▁ it would n't have mattered if they did , i was done answering them . \\n▁ my answers never mattered anyway . \\n▁ i glanced at the chair to my left . \\n▁ in english , sawyer had been in that seat and i suddenly wished i was back in that class , even with will and randy there . \\n▁ her presence was just so calming . \\n▁ currently , a pale , blonde guy named simon was sitting there , ignoring me . \\n▁ that seat was supposed to have darren . \\n▁ this was our class together this year - just us guys . \\n▁ we would have used this class to catch up , without the constant interruptions of our beautiful , but chatty girlfriends , and plan ` ` outings . '' \\n▁ darren was great at finding things to do in this small town , and this would have been the class we 'd tune out to discuss it . \\n▁ i pictured him over there , an annoyed look on his face at hearing the dribble the teacher was spouting about the civil war , and in a hushed voice , going over his plan to abduct his neighbor 's cat and see if the mewling creature could find its way home from a mile away . \\n▁ i had quickly talked him out of that plan last year . \\n▁ the rest of class went by quietly , with no one else brave enough to ask me anything . \\n▁ i ' m pretty sure they 'd all heard my answer anyway . \\n▁ again , i let most of the room filter out before i left it - less awkward moments that way . \\n▁ i headed back upstairs to the second floor , where my philosophy class was . \\n▁ it was the last door in the hallway , and i slowly trudged towards it . \\n▁ there were stares and whispers in the hall . \\n▁ i vaguely heard my outburst in class repeated back to me and of course , by the time i made it through the dwindling crowd of people , the story had been altered so that i had shouted , ` ` i was drinking . '' \\n▁ i sighed and pushed it from my mind . \\n▁ i could n't stop the gossip train and i could n't alter its course . \\n▁ these people needed a villain and my survival had ensured them one . \\n▁ we all have to play our parts , right ? \\n▁ i paused with my hand on the door to my third period class , suddenly nervous . \\n▁ not for the stares that i was getting more and more used to , no , my nerves were for the fact that lillian and i were supposed to have this class together . \\n▁ i 'd signed up for it , because the class looked good on college applications . \\n▁ lil had signed up with me , because she loved the subject . \\n▁ she 'd even had lofty goals of becoming a counselor some day . \\n▁ i was n't sure what demons were going to haunt me when i opened this door . \\n▁ i turned the knob with my dream last night in my head ; maybe it would n't be so bad picturing her again . \\n▁ i had sort of enjoyed seeing glimpses of sammy and darren today , maybe seeing lil like this would be pleasant . \\n▁ i quickly opened the door and stepped through . \\n▁ i 'd made good time and the class was only half full . \\n▁ i halfway expected a specter of lil to hover in the middle of the room , but she did n't . \\n▁ the room was empty ; a generic high school classroom with mass - produced posters of socrates and freud on the walls . \\n▁ i hurried to take a seat in the back while they were still open . \\n▁ luckily , our school adopted a first come , first serve policy on seating . \\n▁ students started piling in , and as i could have predicted , none of my former teammates walked through the door , choosing to get easier a 's elsewhere . \\n▁ but a pleasant surprise did enter as the bell rang . \\n▁ sawyer hopped through the door right as the obnoxious thing sounded and she quickly sprinted to a seat . \\n▁ she looked a little winded as she plopped down in her now traditional spot on my left . \\n▁ her gray eyes turned to sparkle at mine as a playful smile curved her lips . \\n▁ she 'd known i 'd be here . \\n▁ she 'd known we 'd have this class together . \\n▁ i smiled as i watched her work on calming her breath . \\n▁ it was sort of a long way from the science building to all the way back up here in the main building 's second floor . \\n▁ i leaned in close to her . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't plan your schedule very well . '' \\n▁ she frowned as she took a couple deep breaths . \\n▁ ` ` i planned it just fine . '' \\n▁ i smirked at her . \\n▁ ` ` you just went from the second floor , to the farthest building away , and then right back to the second floor . \\n▁ how is that good planning ? '' \\n▁ her lips twisted as she thought of a response . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't sign up for gym this year . '' \\n▁ her head indicated the path she 'd taken . \\n▁ ` ` that just made up for it . '' \\n▁ i shook my head at her and she sighed and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i registered late . \\n▁ they gave me what was still open . '' \\n▁ the smirk left my face as i realized that she was taking spots that had been vacated … by my friends . \\n▁ i turned back to the front of the room , suddenly seeing that vision of lillian - right over the top of sawyer . \\n▁ it was too much , too hard . \\n▁ i felt the tears forming and the overwhelming desire to run . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and took long , deep breaths . \\n▁ i felt sawyer 's hand on my arm and felt that peaceful heat that she seemed to generate , all the way through my jacket . \\n▁ not caring who was watching at the moment , i reached up and grabbed her hand with my own . \\n▁ i squeezed it , and for long minutes , we sat in the back row , our hands clasped together in the aisle way between us . \\n▁ i finally felt normal enough to open my eyes . \\n▁ the teacher had already begun class and was taking attendance ; my name was last , as usual . \\n▁ while i waited , still clutching sawyer 's hand , i felt the stares around me . \\n▁ i felt them and ignored them . \\n▁ i heard the whispers too and i heard sawyer 's name repeated in those whispers . \\n▁ i felt bad that my attempt to keep her out of the gossip circle this morning , by not doing exactly what i was doing , had failed horribly . \\n▁ if yesterday had n't already , i 'd finally dragged her into my misery . \\n▁ feeling guilty , i dropped her hand . \\n▁ i glanced over at her and thought she looked hurt for a moment . \\n▁ the look faded as she met my eye though , so i could n't be sure . \\n▁ she only gave me a small , reassuring smile … and it did reassure me . \\n▁ the peace in her gaze washed over me and i felt myself returning to normal , my previous painful moment pushed back . \\n▁ i could n't think about lil here just yet , not like i could the others . \\n▁ my dream had brought every detail of her right back to the surface . \\n▁ she was crystal clear in my head and memories of us right now would tear me to pieces . \\n▁ it was too hard . \\n▁ with her , it was just too hard . \\n▁ i missed hearing my name being called the first time and the teacher had to repeat it . \\n▁ i looked back and mr . varner was staring right at me , he obviously knew i was here , but was waiting for a response . \\n▁ ` ` here , '' i muttered and he smirked at me . \\n▁ mr . varner was the male equivalent of ms . reynolds : young , stylish and as sammy had informed me once - ` ` hot as hell '' . \\n▁ there were rumors around the school that he was sort of a playboy , and from the thick , dark hair , piercing blue eyes and overall movie star good looks , i could see that . \\n▁ darren had told me once that he 'd heard mr . varner ` ` dated '' students sometimes . \\n▁ i did n't think that was true , and certainly no one had ever caught him , or accused him of anything , but the girls in the class were all staring at him like he might try and sweep them off their feet at any moment . \\n▁ while the gossip floating around this teacher was more socially acceptable than my gossip , i thought maybe of all the teachers in the school , he would understand my situation and be all the more compassionate for it . \\n▁ i was wrong . \\n▁ he berated me for a good five minutes on ditching class the first day of school , and then loaded the entire class down with a paper due by friday , which he highly indicated was my fault . \\n▁ the girls in the classroom never lost their adoring look for him , only hardened their glances at me , like i had actually given them the assignment . \\n▁ i decided that no amount of philosophy studying would ever help me understand the female gender - they were just not understandable . \\n▁ after class , sawyer walked around her desk to come over and stand by me . \\n▁ as most of the bodies shuffled out of the room , she indicated the door with her head , her long , dark hair flowing over her shoulder at the movement . \\n▁ my eyes rested on her jacket , my jacket , and i hoped my name was still covered on her back , for her sake . \\n▁ ` ` come on . '' \\n▁ she put her hand on my elbow and gently pulled , and i had the sudden feeling that she 'd really wanted to grab my hand again . \\n▁ i debated grabbing hers , that had felt so nice during class , but i was loathe to create more problems for her , and only a handful of students had seen our intimate contact . \\n▁ us walking down the hall hand in hand , even if it was just a friendly gesture , would be a neon announcement in this school . \\n▁ i did n't want her being scrutinized like that , so i scooted away from her touch and started walking towards the door . \\n▁ she frowned slightly , but followed me . \\n▁ ` ` where are you off to next ? '' \\n▁ i asked , as we started walking side by side down the hall . \\n▁ she grinned crookedly at me . \\n▁ ` ` i need to make a pit stop at my locker and then we have fourth together . '' \\n▁ i matched her grin as i looked over at her . \\n▁ one benefit of a small school , i suppose , you ran into a lot of the same students in class . \\n▁ there was a fifteen minute ` ` break '' between third and fourth period , so we had time to leisurely make our way down to the first floor , which held the upperclassman lockers . \\n▁ i thought over the upcoming class and swallowed a lump that was suddenly in my throat . \\n▁ math analysis . \\n▁ we were all going to take that class together . \\n▁ we were going to make our own study group and help each other get through tests . \\n▁ okay , lil , sammy and i were going to study and help each other get through tests . \\n▁ darren 's plan was to copy off of sammy . \\n▁ i pictured her in the hallway , just as we approached the lockers . \\n▁ she 'd harshly smacked darren on the arm after he 'd told her that , and informed him that he could absolutely not cheat off her . \\n▁ darren and i had given each other small smiles after she said that - of course she 'd let him cheat off her . \\n▁ there was n't a whole lot sammy would n't let darren do . \\n▁ i walked to the locker that was assigned to me and paused before it , taking in the one on the right and the two on the left . \\n▁ darren had bribed someone in the office last year to get all of our lockers together . \\n▁ lillian had joked at the time that it was almost liked we all lived together while we were at school . \\n▁ i ran my fingers over the locker beside mine , the one that would have been hers . \\n▁ my breath started getting fainter . \\n▁ fingers brushed mine and i startled , almost expecting to see lil again . \\n▁ i looked over and saw sawyer watching me curiously , her fingers over mine on the locker , the locker where she was currently twisting the combination lock with her other hand . \\n▁ it finally registered then , that she was opening that locker , and shock knocked my breath back . \\n▁ ` ` this is yours ? '' \\n▁ my brows scrunched together as i considered that . \\n▁ her brows scrunched together too as she looked over my paling face . \\n▁ ` ` yes … is that one yours ? '' \\n▁ she indicated the one beside hers and i absentmindedly nodded . \\n▁ ` ` they gave you lil 's , '' i muttered under my breath . \\n▁ ` ` lil ? '' \\n▁ her hand closed around mine and she stopped trying to open her locker . \\n▁ ` ` who is lil ? \\n▁ i ' ve heard the name in whispers , but no one will really talk about her … and yesterday … '' she looked down as my eyes watered , i was n't even sure if i could tell her about lillian . \\n▁ ` ` yesterday ? '' \\n▁ i said quietly , trying to prolong my agony . \\n▁ she looked up and then back down the hallway , where i ' m assuming a good section of people were watching us stand beside each other with her hand over mine . \\n▁ i resisted the urge to pull away from her , to spare her the rumors . \\n▁ she stepped closer to me when she looked back up to my face , our bodies nearly touching now , and i again resisted the urge to get some space between us . \\n▁ she should n't be so close to me . \\n▁ i was n't good for her . \\n▁ ` ` you called me lil yesterday in english … you looked really confused . '' \\n▁ i dropped my head and closed my eyes . \\n▁ i 'd nearly forgotten that i 'd heard lil 's voice and gotten confused , thinking for a moment that sawyer was her . \\n▁ i 'd been such an emotional wreck that day … i suppose i still was . \\n▁ i felt a tear bubble up under my eyelid and tried to will it back into my body . \\n▁ it escaped with my words however . \\n▁ ` ` lillian was my girlfriend … she died in the crash . '' \\n▁ the beginning of a sob started to come out and i bit my lip hard and rested my head against my locker , not wanting to break down in the middle of school . \\n▁ sawyer 's other hand came up to my back where she rubbed me consolingly over my jacket . \\n▁ she stepped even closer , to where we were pseudo - hugging , the movement shielding me from the public 's view and creating a tiny bubble of privacy as we stood close together , next to my dead girlfriend 's locker . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , luc . \\n▁ i did n't know . '' \\n▁ i nodded against the cool metal and concentrated on long inhales through the nose and exhales through the mouth . \\n▁ i would not break down in the hallway . \\n▁ not around these people . \\n▁ sawyer put her head against her locker and looked up at me . \\n▁ i looked down at her as another tear rolled down my cheek and instantly felt the connection again , like here was someone who almost instinctually knew my pain . \\n▁ our eyes held for long seconds , and then she released her hold on my hand and brushed aside the tear from my face . \\n▁ just when i was feeling better , a hand shoved my back , hard , and i pushed into the lockers . \\n▁ i automatically turned my head and moved my body to step in front of sawyer . \\n▁ an irritated josh stood in front of me . \\n▁ his face was twisted in a scowl and his dark eyes flicked between mine and sawyer 's . \\n▁ i could almost see the accusation in those eyes - ` how dare you move on ! \\n▁ did lillian and sammy and my brother mean nothing to you ? ' \\n▁ i swallowed my angry retort to the unasked question that i could clearly see building , and tried to remember that not too long ago , this had been a good friend … and he was all i had left of darren . \\n▁ ` ` josh , can we talk about - '' the minute my soothing tone hit him , his face twisted in rage . \\n▁ he did n't want to hear it . \\n▁ he did n't want to think of me as anything but an evil , soulless creature that had devastated his family . \\n▁ it was almost like he had died in that car as well , as unattainable to me as he was now . \\n▁ he brought his hands up and shoved me again , pushing me and sawyer back into the lockers . \\n▁ she squeaked away at the last minute and tried to pull josh off of me while he yelled obscenities at me . \\n▁ ` ` hey , break it up ! '' \\n▁ coach taylor strode up to where a circle of encouraging students had gathered , students encouraging josh . \\n▁ he pulled josh off of me while those students started groaning at the fight being broken up . \\n▁ ` ` you ! \\n▁ to the principal 's office - now ! '' \\n▁ he grabbed josh 's shirt by the collar and started pulling him away forcefully . \\n▁ while he walked him away , coach turned back to where i was still leaning against the lockers . \\n▁ ` ` i want to talk to you later , west . '' \\n▁ he raised his eyebrows and gave me a look that had most freshmen scurrying to do his bidding . \\n▁ it did n't intimidate me though . \\n▁ i did n't really want to hear what he had to say . \\n▁ the crowd started dispersing after josh 's disappearance ; a lot of them throwing me sulking glances , like it was my fault that coach had stopped josh from kicking my ass . \\n▁ i shook my head and watched them leave . \\n▁ sawyer opened and closed her locker next to mine and shook her head as well . \\n▁ ` ` never a dull moment around you , is it ? '' \\n▁ i looked over to her , wanting to explain and also not wanting to explain . \\n▁ finally , i felt a little information was called for . \\n▁ i sighed softly as i said , ` ` my best friend darren was in the crash , as well as his girlfriend sammy . '' \\n▁ i nodded my head in the direction josh went . \\n▁ ` ` that 's his little brother . '' \\n▁ sawyer turned to look at the direction he 'd gone before swinging her dark hair around to look at me again . \\n▁ her gray eyes were narrowed in anger and i interpreted her look . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , he blames me for killing him . '' \\n▁ i looked up at the ceiling and closed my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` we all used to be friends and now he hates me … spreads lies about me . '' \\n▁ i was positive that more than a few of the rumors around the town were continually circulated because of josh , and after he 'd witnessed the tender moment between sawyer and me , i was positive that rumors would be flying now about her as well . \\n▁ it would n't surprise me if by the end of the day i 'd ` ` knocked '' sawyer up . \\n▁ pretty funny , considering i was still a virgin . \\n▁ sawyer 's tone matched the heat i 'd seen in her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` no offense to your hometown , lucas , but i sort of hate these people . '' \\n▁ i cracked my eyes open and looked down at her cutely angry face . \\n▁ i smiled a little watching her , thinking that her irritation looked sort of like the female version of darren 's . \\n▁ ` ` yeah … sometimes i do too . '' \\n▁ i straightened and pushed myself away from the lockers , deciding right at that moment to not use them . \\n▁ i 'd rather lug around a heavy bag . \\n▁ ` ` one more year … that 's all i have to give this place . '' \\n▁ she finally smiled at me and together , we made our way to math class . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; after math was lunch . \\n▁ i sat at my desk and pretended to flip through the math book , like i was horribly interested in the subject . \\n▁ i was n't . \\n▁ i just wanted the entire room to clear out before i bailed . \\n▁ i was n't planning on heading to the cafeteria with the rest of them . \\n▁ i was n't sure where i was going to go , but doing a perp walk through that room was n't something i wanted to partake in . \\n▁ unfortunately , my feigned interest in mathematics led to mrs . chambers coming up to me and chatting my ear off about it . \\n▁ she seemed oblivious of the whispers and rumors around me as the other students left the classroom , the jocks giving me a final glare before they left with their real teacher , the straight ` a ' student who clearly worshipped them . \\n▁ with her energetic personality , it was hard to gauge what mrs . chambers thought about me , and about the wreck . \\n▁ that did n't have anything to do with math so she did n't discuss it , but she did go into an exceedingly long lecture on the infinitely surprising ways trigonometry can be applied to everyday life . \\n▁ i think she would have chatted with me for the entire lunch period , except for the fact that sawyer smoothly interjected herself and politely excused the both of us . \\n▁ mrs . chambers seemed reluctant to let her potential protege go -lrb- i probably feigned my interest a little too well , what with the nodding and agreeing with her at every possible opportunity -rrb- , but eventually the peppy woman backed off and sawyer and i left the now completely empty classroom . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , '' i muttered as we walked down the cleared out hall . \\n▁ she grinned over at me . \\n▁ ` ` not a problem . \\n▁ i did n't realize you were such a nerd . '' \\n▁ she grinned even wider at me . \\n▁ i matched her wide grin as i looked over her pale , gray eyes and shockingly dark hair . \\n▁ ` ` that 's me … total dork . '' \\n▁ i adjusted my ` getting heavy ' backpack and shoved my hands in my jeans pockets . \\n▁ sawyer slung her arm through the hole along my side that i 'd created by pushing my fingers in my denims , and walked close by my side . \\n▁ it was sort of an intimate move and instantly memories of walking down these very halls with lil that way assaulted me . \\n▁ i remembered her pale , blue eyes looking up to my hazel ones as she 'd leaned her head on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` what do you want to do for lunch ? \\n▁ we could eat with darren and sammy … or … '' she bit her peach stained lip and raised her eyebrows suggestively , ` ` we could try making out in the closet again ? '' \\n▁ she laughed huskily and squeezed me tight . \\n▁ ` ` maybe we wo n't get interrupted by another couple this time ? '' \\n▁ i shut my eyes and stopped walking . \\n▁ i jerked my body away from sawyer , knowing i was being rude , but needing the memory of lillian to leave me . \\n▁ not yet … it hurt too much . \\n▁ i felt my eyes well up and my breath quicken . \\n▁ god , calm down . \\n▁ i should be able to think of her . \\n▁ ca n't i at least think of her ? \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ for a moment the vision was still so strong , that i heard lil 's voice again and not sawyer 's . \\n▁ i pushed that feeling back , along with those stubborn tears , and forced my eyes open . \\n▁ sawyer was watery in my vision and i knew that for the second time today , i was about to lose some tears in front of her . \\n▁ she had such a hurt and compassionate look on her face that i felt my body relaxing and my breath returning . \\n▁ i concentrated on the things about her that were nothing like lil , nothing like anyone who could stoke a memory in me - the slope of her nose , the angle of her chin , the slight almond shaping of her eyes that hinted at some asian heritage , somewhere deep in her blood . \\n▁ focusing on her uniqueness shut my mind off , and i gave her a slight smile as her lips turned to a slight frown . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , '' i muttered as i resumed walking . \\n▁ she waited a couple steps and then she met up with me , her head down , her hands now in my letterman 's jacket that she was wearing . \\n▁ i wondered for a moment if she 'd read too much into me giving her that jacket yesterday . \\n▁ maybe she thought we were a couple now ? \\n▁ if so , my rejection just now had probably hurt her feelings . \\n▁ i suppose i did owe her an explanation . \\n▁ i looked over at where she was studying the ground while we walked . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not you , sawyer . '' \\n▁ she looked up at me with her brows scrunched together . \\n▁ i nodded my head back to where i had my latest freak - out . \\n▁ ` ` lil and i used to … '' my voice choked up and i had to clear it to keep talking , ` ` we used to be like that and for a moment , i remembered how it was with her and i just ca n't … '' i closed my eyes and swallowed roughly . \\n▁ i felt sawyer 's hand on my arm and opened my eyes . \\n▁ we reached the stairs and i stopped on the top one . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry if i have to push you away sometimes . \\n▁ i ' m just not ready to … be that close to someone … right now . '' \\n▁ god , i hoped she was n't offended by that . \\n▁ she did n't appear to be . \\n▁ her cheeks flushed and a look of understanding seemed to hit her . \\n▁ she looked back down the hallway at where we 'd been and then back to me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , lucas . \\n▁ i was n't trying to … '' she shrugged and looked a little embarrassed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not trying to … i ' m just really comfortable with you . \\n▁ but i know you 're going through something awful and probably do n't feel the same way about me … '' i smirked and cocked my head . \\n▁ ` ` you have no idea , sawyer … none . \\n▁ i do n't think i 'd have lasted twenty minutes today if it were n't for you . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` if you only knew how much … peace i find with you . '' \\n▁ she smiled genuinely after i said that , but then she twisted her lips . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not trying to replace her , luc . \\n▁ i just want to be your friend . '' \\n▁ i looked at her for a long time and a comfortable silence built between us . \\n▁ finally , i whispered , ` ` you are my friend … you 're the only one i ' ve got . '' \\n▁ i may have only known her a day , but the truth of that sentence rang through every part of me . \\n▁ her eyes watered and she stepped towards me uncertainly , like she wanted to hug me , but was n't sure if that was okay . \\n▁ i closed the distance for her , bringing my arms around her as xxunk as i could . \\n▁ we both sighed at the comfort that brought us and after a moment we pulled apart and continued our walk out of the building , to who knows where . \\n▁ we ended up eating our lunch in her camaro in the parking lot . \\n▁ it was perfect . \\n▁ she 'd parked on the edge of the lot and the very few people we saw , did n't come out that far to bother us . \\n▁ she flipped the switch on her car and turned the radio on to a sixties rock station . \\n▁ i relaxed back in the seat and grabbed my lunch out of my backpack ; sometime in my haze last night , i 'd made one . \\n▁ when sawyer did n't appear to have anything but an apple in her bag , i gave her half my sandwich and a bag of pretzels . \\n▁ she smiled apologetically , but did n't refuse my offer , and we finished out the lunch period in the confined comfort of her vehicle . \\n▁ when the clock on her dash showed that our free time was up , we headed back out to the campus , to finish up our day . \\n▁ sawyer made her way to her fifth period computer class , where she planned on killing time on the internet whenever she could . \\n▁ i grinned at her as we parted ways . \\n▁ i had astronomy , in the squat , rectangular building that also housed the science classes . \\n▁ as i walked along the sidewalk under the overhang , i remembered that this was my class with sammy and lil . \\n▁ they would have sat side by side in front of me , gossiping about the latest celebrity xxunk or fashion faux - pas . \\n▁ i smiled as i pictured sammy 's reddish hair brushing against lil 's pale hair . \\n▁ i pictured lil turning in her seat to look at me and wink and felt my heart seize . \\n▁ swallowing , i banished the vision i was n't ready to have yet , and walked up to the outside door that led to my class . \\n▁ tugging on the heavy door , my eyes immediately spotted josh when i opened it . \\n▁ his eyes also immediately locked onto mine and narrowed in anger , a state he seemed to permanently reside in . \\n▁ he sat next to some cheerleaders and randy from the football team . \\n▁ he looked back at randy and whispered something and randy glanced up at me entering the room and scowled . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ keeping my head down , i made my way to an empty seat in the back , on the other end of the small room from them . \\n▁ unfortunately , josh had other ideas . \\n▁ he walked across the room to stand right in front of me . \\n▁ i counted to three as he stood there , fists clenched at his sides . \\n▁ the teacher was at the front of the room , writing something on the board as kids filtered through the door , so i figured josh was n't going to try and slug me . \\n▁ taking a deep breath , i looked up at him . \\n▁ ` ` what , josh ? '' \\n▁ i said quietly . \\n▁ his jaw clenched before it relaxed slightly . \\n▁ ` ` i got detention because of you , xxunk . '' \\n▁ i wondered how him slamming me against a locker was my fault , but did n't say anything . \\n▁ he leaned in close at my silence . \\n▁ ` ` i finally made varsity this year . \\n▁ if you get me kicked off the team , i 'll … i 'll … '' he searched my face as he searched for words . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll what , josh ? \\n▁ kill me ? '' \\n▁ my lip curled in a tired smile . \\n▁ his face went red all over as he stared at me in a sudden rage . \\n▁ i turned my head to stare straight ahead of me as i felt eyes in the room watching our every move . \\n▁ i was sure more than a few of those eyes were willing josh to finally hit me . \\n▁ in a weird way , i sort of wanted josh to hit me again . \\n▁ maybe it would get it out of his system this time , if he did it in front of so many people , and maybe then our relationship could … well , at least not be so antagonistic . \\n▁ the teacher cleared his throat as the bell rang and out of the corner of my eye , i saw josh flinch a little at the unexpected sound . \\n▁ josh looked around at the sound of students sitting . \\n▁ he turned back to me and looked me up and down . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't over , lucas . '' \\n▁ i sighed as he walked back to his seat . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't think it was , josh . '' \\n▁ he shot me a glare once he sat back down with randy and i wondered if he 'd heard me . \\n▁ i shook my head and thought that darren would get a kick out of his brother so worked up over me . \\n▁ darren and i got along pretty well , for the most part , but we 'd certainly had our disagreements before . \\n▁ he 'd actually slugged me once , when he 'd thought i 'd hit on sammy . \\n▁ someone in school had started the rumor that we 'd been kissing in the library and he 'd immediately punched me the next time he saw me . \\n▁ that had thrown me , especially since the rumor was completely not true , and i had n't even heard it yet . \\n▁ i 'd been walking with sammy at the time and she 'd wailed on darren after he 'd swung at me . \\n▁ she 'd started laughing once he confessed why he 'd done it and then they 'd spent five minutes sucking face while i rubbed my sore jaw . \\n▁ darren had apologized for slugging me and i 'd accepted his apology … by slugging him right back . \\n▁ eye for an eye , right ? \\n▁ as class began , i smiled over the memory of darren 's shocked face that had quickly turned into an amused one . \\n▁ we 'd play fought after that for fifteen minutes while sammy laughed at the both of us . \\n▁ i ' m pretty sure the words , ` ` you guys are morons '' crossed her lips at some point . \\n▁ i never did find out who 'd started that little rumor . \\n▁ i ' m sure whoever it was , was probably having a field day with me now . \\n▁ the class went by at a quick pace . \\n▁ i actually found the subject fascinating and found myself paying attention , instead of the normal daydreaming about my long gone friends that i had been doing so much of today . \\n▁ all too soon , i found the bell ringing and our teacher , a shriveled older man named mr . thomson , whose balding hair was matched with thick rimmed glasses , making him the epitome of a science nerd , gestured some sort of goodbye with his hand and turned back to the board , erasing his drawings for the next class . \\n▁ i waited for josh to leave before i stood . \\n▁ he gave me a glare that i was sort of getting used to from him , and then he ducked out the door with randy and one of the blonde cheerleaders . \\n▁ i stood and picked up my bag before making my way to the exit . \\n▁ josh luckily was n't outside waiting for me , as i sort of expected him to be , and aside from a few stares , i made my way to my final class in peace . \\n▁ that class was again going to be the four of us . \\n▁ it was going to be our goof off class before darren and i went to football practice and the girls went to volleyball practice . \\n▁ art . \\n▁ it was located in what almost looked like a shack , opposite the back door to the gym . \\n▁ i ducked into the class and found that people were already starting to draw or doodle on paper and were n't paying any attention to me whatsoever . \\n▁ i smiled briefly as i found a seat . \\n▁ i sat at an easel and waited for the teacher , mrs . xxunk , a woman who looked to still be stuck in the sixties with wavy , waist length hair and a look of self - medicated peace on her face , to walk over to me . \\n▁ she smiled widely when she approached me and the warmth in it shocked me for a moment … until she called me tom . \\n▁ i shook my head and said , ` ` no , i ' m lucas '' . \\n▁ then she frowned and nodded slowly , like she suddenly remembered who i was … and what i 'd done . \\n▁ she glanced at a couple of the empty seats in the room and i had the feeling that she was seeing my long gone friends too . \\n▁ i followed her eyesight , and momentarily saw darren making a ` she 's loopy ' signal with his fingers , making my vision of sammy , laugh into her hand . \\n▁ before i could stop it , i had a vision of lil giving darren an admonishing look , her full lips puckered in displeasure . \\n▁ i remembered that dream of kissing those lips last night and felt my eyes get heavy as her beautiful , shiny hair shook around her shoulders , when she shook her head at darren . \\n▁ my breath seized as her face turned towards me and i watched in awe as the lips curled into an easy smile and she opened her mouth to speak . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ i blinked at the unfamiliar voice coming from her lips and glanced up at mrs . xxunk who was trying to explain the assignment that i 'd missed the introduction to yesterday . \\n▁ i 'd been completely wrapped in my memories and i 'd tuned her out . \\n▁ i had no idea what she 'd been talking about . \\n▁ i swallowed the ache in my throat at seeing lil so clearly again and forced myself to concentrate on the teacher . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry … what ? '' \\n▁ she sighed and rolled her eyes , explaining the assignment again to me . \\n▁ her looking at me like i was the space case and not her , was sort of funny , but i could n't find it in myself to laugh . \\n▁ that vision of my girlfriend had been a sudden one . \\n▁ i had n't been prepared for it , not that i ever was . \\n▁ as the teacher walked away , i felt the ache in my chest start to turn towards despair . \\n▁ i flicked my eyes around the room , wishing sawyer had this class with me too , but she did n't , she was n't there . \\n▁ i 'd have to get through this on my own . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and pictured sawyer 's face - her black as night hair and stormy gray eyes . \\n▁ it was an odd combination , but an appealing one too . \\n▁ the vision of her face held no added recollections of my friends , only a peace that i could almost feel washing over my body . \\n▁ my pain momentarily left me . \\n▁ i opened my eyes and picked up a pencil on the easel . \\n▁ our assignment was to draw something that felt like home . \\n▁ at that moment , and as odd as the thought was , only one thing felt like home to me . \\n▁ very carefully , and in as much detail as i could do in an hour , i began to draw her face … sawyer 's face . \\n▁ after class , i was a bit startled to see her actual face again . \\n▁ i 'd been walking out of the shack building and debating walking home , when i 'd nearly run right into her . \\n▁ she 'd just come out of one of the rooms attached to the back of the gym . \\n▁ one of the rooms was used for the band , the other for the choir . \\n▁ i wondered which one she belonged to , but did n't ask her because she looked like she 'd been crying . \\n▁ she startled as she bumped against me and looked up into my face . \\n▁ my jacket was in her hands and her bag was haphazardly slung over her shoulder , crammed papers visible in the top of it , like she 'd fled the room in a hurry . \\n▁ i cocked my head at her , concerned . \\n▁ ` ` are you alright ? '' \\n▁ she swiped a hand under her eyelids and smiled stiffly . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m fine . '' \\n▁ she flicked a glance over her shoulder and my eyes followed . \\n▁ she was looking at a tall , honey - haired girl coming out of the choir room . \\n▁ i frowned when i recognized her - brittany faulkner . \\n▁ the faulkner family was the oldest in our small town . \\n▁ their ancestors were the founding fathers of the town actually . \\n▁ that 's right - our town had actual freaking founding fathers . \\n▁ the town was still big on heritage and all of the xxunk had a holier - than - thou attitude . \\n▁ they also had a good sum of money to go along with that prestige and in a way , kind of ruled the town . \\n▁ and brittany … ruled the school . \\n▁ she 'd been a part of our social circle with darren , sammy , lil and i . \\n▁ she was again , one of those people that i was n't sure why we were friends with her . \\n▁ she was in no way nice . \\n▁ but she was attractive , very attractive , and she 'd had her eye on me since the ninth grade . \\n▁ she was actually the first girl that let me feel her up . \\n▁ it had happened after practice my freshman year and i 'd always known that it would n't have necessarily had to stop at my hands up her shirt . \\n▁ i 'd always known that i could have gone much farther with her … i just had n't wanted to . \\n▁ sawyer 's eyes quickly averted from brittany 's glare , as her brown eyes swept over to our position . \\n▁ i continued to look at her , wondering just what she 'd done or said to sawyer . \\n▁ an odd look crossed her face ; her eyes narrowed at me in contempt , much like josh 's actually , but her lips curled into a small , inviting smile , like i could still do more than just feel her up … she would just hate me at the same time . \\n▁ i scrunched my brow as i watched her , watch me . \\n▁ brittany smirked and then stalked off . \\n▁ brittany had been in a huff around me ever since i 'd started dating lil , maybe even before that , but definitely after lil and i 'd hooked up . \\n▁ i suspected she was jealous , but she never really had acted like she was , it was just an odd sort of feeling i used to get hanging around her . \\n▁ a sudden light went off in my head as i wondered if she was the one that used to circulate cheating rumors around about me . \\n▁ after she walked away , i focused my attention back to where sawyer was putting my jacket back on . \\n▁ ` ` is she bugging you ? '' \\n▁ i asked her quietly . \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` do n't worry about it , luc . \\n▁ i can handle bitches . '' \\n▁ i frowned and started to reply when she met and held my gaze . \\n▁ her eyes were back to their crystal clear peacefulness and her voice dropped to that oddly serious tone . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve dealt with much worse . \\n▁ i can deal with her . '' \\n▁ she shook her head as i wondered what she meant . \\n▁ ` ` it 's nothing . '' \\n▁ i shrugged , figuring she 'd tell me when and if she was ready . \\n▁ an idea struck me as i realized i 'd made it through an entire school day and we were now free . \\n▁ i smiled a genuine smile for the first time all day . \\n▁ ` ` we 're done , sawyer … we 're free . '' \\n▁ i smiled wider as she grinned at me crookedly . \\n▁ ` ` want to come over to my house ? '' \\n▁ i leaned in and raised an eyebrow . \\n▁ ` ` we have hot pockets . '' \\n▁ she laughed and started to nod , but then she closed her eyes and her happy look fell into a disgruntled one . \\n▁ ` ` ugh , i ca n't . '' \\n▁ i started to ask why as my face fell as well , but she answered before i could . \\n▁ ` ` i had to sign up for that safe and sound club . '' \\n▁ she sighed and kicked a rock on the ground . \\n▁ ` ` part of my probation , '' she muttered sullenly . \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ you 're joining the purity club … really ? '' \\n▁ she looked back up at me and grimaced . \\n▁ ` ` not by choice . \\n▁ it was the only way my parents would give me the tiniest bit of slack . '' \\n▁ she sighed and her shoulders slumped . \\n▁ i cocked an eyebrow at her as i looked over her crestfallen face . \\n▁ ` ` did you burn down your old school or something ? '' \\n▁ she grinned crookedly at me and then laughed . \\n▁ ` ` i wish . '' \\n▁ her eyes took on a guarded look . \\n▁ ` ` no , it was … something else . '' \\n▁ she looked away , obviously not wanting to talk about it , and i let the conversation drop . \\n▁ again , she 'd tell me if she was ready . \\n▁ i was n't about to push . \\n▁ ` ` all right then … let 's go . '' \\n▁ she looked back to me with a satisfyingly startled face . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ you 're coming ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve got nothing else to do … and i could use a ride home . '' \\n▁ she laughed again and hugged me tight . \\n▁ i savored the warmth of her embrace and delighted that i had actually made someone in this school happy … by staying . \\n▁ i laughed and hugged her back . \\n▁ she pulled away from me abruptly and looked a touch embarrassed for her sudden attack . \\n▁ i laughed at the look on her face and we started walking back towards the main building . \\n▁ we walked past groups of kids heading out to the parking lot , and watched other groups of kids head out to the numerous buses all parked and waiting for them . \\n▁ several students eyed us walking together , but she and i both ignored them . \\n▁ we were getting good at this , although i did still feel a little bad that just my presence was causing a small gossip storm to swirl around her . \\n▁ i hoped brittany was n't attacking her over me … maybe for her wearing my jacket , or something stupid like that . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you have practice ? '' \\n▁ she asked quietly as we walked , her fingers picking at the sleeves of my jacket , her habit of playing with them still apparently in full effect . \\n▁ i smiled sadly as i looked down on her . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ not this year . \\n▁ not anymore . '' \\n▁ i thought about josh , randy , will and all the others on my old team meeting with coach on the field right about now . \\n▁ while i was glad i would n't be running into any of them anymore today , a part of me missed my old routine . \\n▁ but that had changed , along with everything else . \\n▁ sawyer looked up at me with curious eyes . \\n▁ ` ` it just does n't seem so important anymore , '' i answered her unasked question quietly . \\n▁ her pale eyes regarded me with a deep understanding and she nodded , like she knew exactly what i meant . \\n▁ i smiled softly and felt that deep connection again as we walked the rest of the way in silence . \\n▁ the purity club met on the first floor in the main building . \\n▁ as we approached the classroom door we saw the handmade sign taped over the window - safe and sound club : because we care about you . \\n▁ i rolled my eyes . \\n▁ god , i really did n't want to be here , but i had n't wanted to part ways with sawyer yet either . \\n▁ i was still sort of hoping she 'd come over later . \\n▁ it would make the night go by a lot faster , if i could share a chunk of it with her . \\n▁ sawyer put her hand on the knob and turned to look at me . \\n▁ she rolled her eyes too and sighed softly . \\n▁ ` ` ready ? '' \\n▁ she muttered . \\n▁ ` ` sure , '' i answered , as she swung the door open . \\n▁ the room was n't very full , not too surprising , i suppose . \\n▁ there were maybe eight people there and the supervising teacher , ms . reynolds . \\n▁ she brightened as sawyer entered the room and i thought she 'd start glowing when she noticed me . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer , lucas . \\n▁ i ' m so glad you decided to join us . '' \\n▁ she came over and put a hand on my shoulder as she said that and again , i felt like her statement was just for my benefit . \\n▁ we gave her halfhearted grins and she directed us to some open seats . \\n▁ a wave of whispers followed us as we made our way to the back of the room . \\n▁ we sat on a couple desks , pushing them close together , and dangling our feet off the edge . \\n▁ we waited silently as a couple more students trickled in . \\n▁ sawyer looked down and started playing with the hem of my jacket sleeve around her wrist while i scanned the room . \\n▁ i caught more than a couple people giving me questioning glances . \\n▁ a couple people smiled sardonically and one even smiled encouragingly , but the majority frowned slightly , sure i was only here to mock their stupid club probably . \\n▁ well , i was n't . \\n▁ i was n't here to mock or engage . \\n▁ i was here to spend time with sawyer . \\n▁ as the stares kept up , i started wondering if that was a bad idea and i should have just parted ways with her . \\n▁ oh well . \\n▁ eventually ms . reynolds started the meeting and thanked us all for coming . \\n▁ she assured everyone that together we could help steer the student body to a clean and sober life . \\n▁ i bit back an amused smile . \\n▁ one tiny club was going to stop high schoolers from rebelling with secret parties and illegally obtained alcohol ? \\n▁ i do n't think so . \\n▁ sawyer snickered softly beside me , and then skillfully switched it to a cough in her hand when a couple people glanced back and glared at her . \\n▁ i bumped her shoulder with mine and whispered for her to take this seriously . \\n▁ she looked up at my half grin and laughed . \\n▁ after the introductions , we were subjected to an hour of choosing club positions . \\n▁ the speeches for the potential president went on for fifteen minutes . \\n▁ by the actual vote , i was ready to make for the hills , but i stuck it out and enjoyed sawyer 's presence on the desk beside me as we whispered more interesting speeches for the candidates in the back of the room during the entire meeting . \\n▁ sawyer brought me to near laughing out loud several times with her dry sense of humor . \\n▁ in some ways she really reminded me of darren , and i had the sudden feeling that he really would have liked her . \\n▁ luckily , neither sawyer nor i were nominated for any positions , and eventually the elections ended with sally xxunk winning the coveted presidential position . \\n▁ i picked up my stuff to get out of there and just when i was going to ask sawyer if she still wanted to come over , ms . reynolds walked up to our side . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … could i speak to you for a moment ? '' \\n▁ her young face looked greatly concerned and i cringed at whatever she wanted . \\n▁ i did n't have it in me to deny a direct request made by a teacher though . \\n▁ ` ` um … sure , '' i said slowly . \\n▁ sawyer beside me slung her bag over her shoulder and gave me a sympathetic look . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , luc , i ca n't hang around . \\n▁ my parents are expecting me home right after the meeting . '' \\n▁ my face fell as i looked over hers . \\n▁ damn , i 'd so been hoping that we could hang out longer , but she had to go . \\n▁ damn , i was going to have to walk home now too . \\n▁ she put a hand on my arm and muttered , ` ` have a good night . \\n▁ see ya tomorrow . '' \\n▁ i nodded and watched her comforting presence leave the room . \\n▁ with a soft sigh , i turned to face ms . reynolds , who was watching her leave as well . \\n▁ finally , she turned to face me and her lips compressed to a thin line . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't take that very seriously . '' \\n▁ i scrunched my brows as i tried to absorb what she meant . \\n▁ seeing my confusion , she filled in the blanks . \\n▁ ` ` the meeting , the entire time you were either spacing out or talking to sawyer . '' \\n▁ she lowered her voice and leaned into me , bringing her hand back up to my arm . \\n▁ ` ` you , of all people , lucas , should take this seriously . \\n▁ we 're here to help you . '' \\n▁ her voice conveyed her true concern for what she clearly saw as a severely troubled teen and i immediately bristled at the implication . \\n▁ i jerked away from her . \\n▁ ` ` i came here for sawyer . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , suddenly feeling very angry . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not interested in your little club . '' \\n▁ the sneer in my voice was unmistakable and ms . reynolds straightened and backed up a step . \\n▁ she set her jaw at my tone and her eyes flashed with something that almost looked like anger too . \\n▁ ` ` well , for your future … i hope you reconsider . '' \\n▁ her face softened as her sudden anger left her . \\n▁ ` ` we 're always here for you , lucas . '' \\n▁ shaking my head , i turned away from her and left the room . \\n▁ her implication was all too clear - you have a problem and you need to join our little group so we can get you sober . \\n▁ god , since when did being drunk once in my life constitute a drinking problem . \\n▁ just goes to show you how easy it can be for people to believe the lie … and how resistant people can be to believe the truth . \\n▁ in a huff , i made my way to the parking lot which let out to the street that took me home . \\n▁ i did n't like being angry at ms . reynolds . \\n▁ i did like her and she was only concerned over my well being , one of the few individuals in this town that did actually care about me . \\n▁ i was just tired of being looked at like some after school special . \\n▁ halfway through the parking lot , a horn beeping snapped me out of my reverie . \\n▁ in a daze , i looked over at what car was making the noise . \\n▁ i stopped walking and cocked my head when i noticed sawyer 's camaro driving towards me . \\n▁ my lips automatically curled into a smile as she pulled up alongside me . \\n▁ i bent down as she rolled down her window . \\n▁ ` ` what are you still doing here ? '' \\n▁ i asked her . \\n▁ she smiled and shrugged , her hand resting over the steering wheel . \\n▁ ` ` i just remembered that you probably needed a ride . '' \\n▁ she shook her dark head . \\n▁ ` ` my parents can wait a few minutes . '' \\n▁ i smiled and walked around the front of her car to get in the passenger 's side . \\n▁ settling into the , getting familiar , bucket seat , i inhaled the clean scent of lemons and sighed at not having to walk home after all . \\n▁ laying my head back on the seat , i rolled it to the side to look at her while she pulled the car forward . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to do this . \\n▁ i do n't want you to get in trouble because of me . '' \\n▁ she laughed and looked over at me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m already in a constant state of trouble . \\n▁ really , this is nothing . '' \\n▁ her smile turned into a concerned look as she turned back to face the road . \\n▁ ` ` what did ms . reynolds want ? '' \\n▁ i sighed and ran a hand though my hair . \\n▁ ` ` oh , just your basic , you ' ve got a problem , let us help you speech . '' \\n▁ i exhaled roughly and stared out the window at the small town streaking by . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd think i was lindsey xxunk for how they all look at me . '' \\n▁ she snorted and i looked back at her . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think they 're looking at you like you 're a wacked out , washed up starlet . '' \\n▁ she looked over at me and grinned and i could n't help but grin back . \\n▁ ` ` you know what i mean , '' i muttered . \\n▁ she laughed again and turned back to the road . \\n▁ then her look got more serious . \\n▁ ` ` did you … did you drink a lot , lucas ? '' \\n▁ she looked over at me as i tried to keep a scowl from my face . \\n▁ apparently i had n't done a very good job , because she quickly added , ` ` i just … i do n't know , lucas . \\n▁ i ' ve only just met you . \\n▁ i do n't know what you were like before … '' she shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i do still believe that you were n't that night , but i was just wondering why they are all so quick to believe the stories . '' \\n▁ i relaxed and looked back to the sidewalk blurring by . \\n▁ i should n't get snippy at her , it was a fair question . \\n▁ she really did n't know me , and i ' m sure she 'd been getting an earful of unpleasant information on me . \\n▁ she must wonder if my being sober that night was the rarity . \\n▁ softly , i sighed into the window . \\n▁ ` ` no … i ' ve never been a really big drinker . \\n▁ i just did n't care for it , for being out of control like that . '' \\n▁ i sighed and looked back at her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been drunk exactly once in my life … and it was sort of a disaster . '' \\n▁ i shook my head and looked back out the front window . \\n▁ ` ` they all know that about me too . \\n▁ my … resistance was sort of an inside joke with my friends . \\n▁ ` oh , let 's get lucas drunk - cue the mission impossible theme ' . '' \\n▁ i sighed again and felt her hand snake over to clench mine . \\n▁ i laced our fingers together and relaxed even further into her touch . \\n▁ ` ` why do they all believe it then ? '' \\n▁ i exhaled softly and looked over as her eyes intently studied the road . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ she squeezed my hand and we let the conversation fade . \\n▁ a warm silence fell upon the car and i closed my eyes and concentrated on the feeling of her tiny hand in mine . \\n▁ it was nice to hold someone 's hand again . \\n▁ i stroked my thumb along the side of hers and felt her hand stiffen slightly before relaxing . \\n▁ her skin was soft and silky and i smiled at the feeling of it sliding under my skin . \\n▁ i was sure my hand felt rough in comparison , but sawyer never complained or pulled her hand away , just continued to let me hold hers and stroke it with mine . \\n▁ i pushed back the memories of doing this with lil as sawyer 's car sped to my house . \\n▁ lil and i had held hands a lot , but usually only walking between classes in the more traditional ` cup ' hold . \\n▁ if we were alone in a quiet car … well , we were generally doing more than holding hands . \\n▁ i pushed those memories back as well . \\n▁ trying to distract my mind from wandering down an alley i was n't ready for yet , i focused on the dips and curves of sawyer 's hand as my thumb stretched out to feel more of it . \\n▁ i swept my thumb over the back of her hand , sliding over the long , elegant bones and the smooth knuckles . \\n▁ i adjusted my hand so i could sweep my thumb up to her palm , feeling the hill - like edges that led down to the valley in the exact center . \\n▁ then my thumb traveled straight down that valley , heading towards her petite wrist . \\n▁ she abruptly jerked her hand away from mine and startled , i opened my eyes . \\n▁ i blushed a bit , thinking i 'd gone beyond the terms of our friendship with my little ` ` body exploration '' and was about to sputter an apology , when i noticed she was turning the steering wheel to pull into the drive of my home . \\n▁ i studied her face as she did that , but i did n't see any irritation or embarrassment , actually , she looked kind of blank as she straightened the wheel and put the car in park . \\n▁ she looked over at me and that apology was still on the tip of my tongue , but she beat me to it . \\n▁ ` ` we 're here … '' she looked at me a little sheepishly and ran the hand i 'd darn near been caressing , back through her hair , tucking some dark strands behind her ear . \\n▁ i glanced at my house and then back to her . \\n▁ ` ` oh … thanks for the ride . '' \\n▁ she nodded and smiled slightly at me . \\n▁ i could n't shake the feeling that i 'd messed up , so that apology finally did seep out of me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry about … '' i pointed to her hand that was picking at her jacket sleeve . \\n▁ ` ` i just … i was n't thinking . \\n▁ i ' m sorry if that made you uncomfortable . '' \\n▁ she looked down and i thought i saw a light coloring flush her cheeks , but her hair had fallen down around her face and i could n't be sure . \\n▁ i resisted the urge to sweep that hair back so i could see her better . \\n▁ ` ` it 's fine , lucas . \\n▁ i liked it … '' i felt a lingering ` ` but '' in the air , but she did n't say anything else . \\n▁ that non - explanation filled the car with a strange tension and i opened my door to break it . \\n▁ she finally looked back up at me when i did . \\n▁ i put one foot out the door and paused , looking back at her . \\n▁ ` ` i know you have to go , but … do you want to come in ? '' \\n▁ i grinned crookedly at her . \\n▁ ` ` after all , you 're already in trouble . '' \\n▁ she smiled a little and then looked down at her hand … the hand . \\n▁ ` ` no , i better not push it . '' \\n▁ she looked back up at me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll see you tomorrow , lucas . '' \\n▁ i had the sudden feeling that she would have said yes if that awkward moment in the car had n't happened and a strange guilt washed through me . \\n▁ i looked down at my foot on the pavement before swinging my head back around to her waiting gray eyes . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ see you , sawyer . '' \\n▁ i started to stand and then stopped , settling my weight back down to the car seat . \\n▁ meeting her eye again , i told her , ` ` thank you … for today . \\n▁ i do n't think i 'd of made it without you . '' \\n▁ i smiled warmly on the end and she returned it , her eyes searching my face . \\n▁ i wondered what she was looking for , when she finally replied . \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome , luc … any time . '' \\n▁ she sighed softly and then her eyes settled back to mine . \\n▁ i smiled , nodded and started to exit the car . \\n▁ i was halfway standing when she spoke . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ i turned in the door to look back at her . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to pick you up in the morning ? \\n▁ so you do n't have to walk , '' she quickly added . \\n▁ i grinned widely at the thought of both spending more time with her , and not having to walk all the way to school again tomorrow . \\n▁ plus the added bonus of avoiding hopping on another bus , should the weather take a turn for the worse . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd love that … thank you . '' \\n▁ her wide grin matched my own and i jauntily exited the car and shut it . \\n▁ i was grinning and waving goodbye like an idiot when she pulled out of the drive and sped away , back towards town . \\n▁ i wondered where she lived for a moment and then , shoving my hands in my pockets , turned and made my way inside my small house for an exciting night of doing homework , watching bland television shows and maybe for dinner , just for something different … ham and cheese hot pockets . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i stirred in my bed and sighed as the rustle of the sheets brought me slightly to consciousness . \\n▁ i instinctively knew it was dark , still in the middle of the night , and did n't bother with opening my eyes . \\n▁ as i moved my legs under the covers , i collided with another pair of legs . \\n▁ confused , i reached out with my hand and indeed felt another pair of long , bare , shapely legs . \\n▁ even more confused , i followed those legs up to a very firm backside . \\n▁ my hand slipped over what could only be my favorite pair of silky bikini panties . \\n▁ i smiled at the remembered cut of them , the way they 'd looked against ivory flesh , the light pink color with one giant , red heart in the back and the word ` love ' in red script across the front . \\n▁ my fingers ran around to the front and i felt where the different fabric of the word stood out against the silk . \\n▁ a soft feminine sigh met my searching hand and i adjusted my body to feel more of the body lying next to me . \\n▁ my hands ran up a bare stomach and my body responded instantly . \\n▁ i felt the quick inhales and exhales as my hand ran up that nak * d skin . \\n▁ i felt the light breath on my face and heard a soft moan in my ear . \\n▁ i bit my lip and continued on up , hoping to find what i knew was typically paired with that sexy underwear . \\n▁ my fingers ran over the fabric covering a breast . \\n▁ i traced two letters on one side of the bra ` l ' and ` o ' , then my hand moved over to feel the other silky cup . \\n▁ sure enough - ` v ' and ` e ' . \\n▁ i pressed my incredibly ready body right up against the figure beside me . \\n▁ i was rewarded with lean legs tangling over mine and a warm hand on my lower back pulling me in tight . \\n▁ i groaned as our lower halves connected . \\n▁ my hands continued on up from that amazingly sexy bra to a slender neck ; i could feel the heartbeat raging in the veins as i brought my lips to them . \\n▁ the familiar scent of perfume mixed with peach body wash filled me . \\n▁ my hands went up even farther to tangle in long silky hair and a low moan escaped soft lips as my tongue found a sensitive spot in the crook of the neck , a spot i knew very well . \\n▁ small hands came up my back , under my t - shirt , and clutched at my bare skin as our bodies shifted and moved together , teasing each other , satisfying each other . \\n▁ my lips moved up that fragrant neck and not able to take it anymore , i hungrily found an equally eager mouth in the darkness . \\n▁ i groaned and pressed against the length of the nearly nak * d body beside me as my tongue felt for and found its match . \\n▁ my midnight companion returned both of my actions readily and let a loud moan escape into the still air . \\n▁ ` ` quiet , lil , you 'll wake my mom , '' i muttered between our lips . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , luc … that just feels amazing , '' she breathily muttered back . \\n▁ i smiled and rolled her over to her back , pressing my hard body more firmly into hers . \\n▁ i knew exactly what felt amazing to her , and this was something we 'd done on several occasions . \\n▁ in fact , we 'd done this very thing a couple nights before the accident , when i 'd been awoken from a deep sleep to find that lillian had nearly undressed and slid into bed with me . \\n▁ oh , wait … we 'd done this exact thing , even right down to the underwear . \\n▁ i breathily pulled back from her lips . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m dreaming again … are n't i ? '' \\n▁ i finally opened my eyes and looked at the vision of a blonde goddess , biting her lip and writhing beneath me as our bodies pressed together intimately . \\n▁ her hands reached up to tangle in my hair as she pulled me in for a kiss that left me aching . \\n▁ ` ` yes … god , yes , '' she muttered . \\n▁ i had no idea if she was answering my question or being … satisfied . \\n▁ with the look on her face when she said that , i really did n't care . \\n▁ my dream of her weeks ago paled in comparison with this one and even though i knew waking from this would sort of kill me , i eagerly returned her deep kiss and decided i 'd deal with that pain if i got to feel this again . \\n▁ her hands reached down to pull off my shirt and i let her , helping out where i could . \\n▁ there was an eagerness in our desire to be as nak * d as we could with each other and i found the lounge pants i 'd slept in quickly beside the bed with my shirt . \\n▁ our bodies met and hungered for each other as small gasps and groans filled the air . \\n▁ she shushed me and on occasion , more than a few actually , i shushed her . \\n▁ we 'd done all of this before . \\n▁ lil had a habit of sneaking out of her bed and into mine . \\n▁ it was a habit i greatly enjoyed . \\n▁ she 'd appeared in next to nothing a few times and had driven me nearly to madness several times too , but we 'd never gone all the way . \\n▁ while we 'd both said we were n't ready for that , during moments like these , i think it was only the fact that my mom was down the hall and we were afraid we 'd wake her , that had stopped those intimate sessions from being our first time together , our first time ever . \\n▁ not that we had n't experimented . \\n▁ not that we had n't brought each other to release . \\n▁ we 'd just never technically ` ` had sex '' . \\n▁ as our bodies more frantically rubbed together , and i realized none of this was even real , i began to wonder why we could n't now . \\n▁ we would n't wake my mom up in a dream … and it felt so real … my hands slid down her smooth skin to her underwear and i started slipping them off . \\n▁ her hands quickly found mine and stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she breathed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not ready for that . '' \\n▁ her legs wrapped more firmly around mine and she pulled our h * ps together . \\n▁ ` ` just like this , we can come together , just like this . \\n▁ i 'll be quiet … promise . '' \\n▁ i groaned quietly as i realized that i was pretty close to coming already . \\n▁ ` ` i want more , lil . \\n▁ i want all of you . '' \\n▁ she kissed me softly and sped up her hips , maybe hoping to speed up the finale so i could n't convince her otherwise . \\n▁ ` ` not yet , luc … soon , but not yet . '' \\n▁ my mind shifted back to a similar conversation that i 'd had with the real lillian . \\n▁ ` ` why not ? \\n▁ we 're so close , lil . \\n▁ i ' m so ready for you . \\n▁ i want to please you like that . \\n▁ do n't you want that ? '' \\n▁ her back arched and her head fell back . \\n▁ ` ` oh , yes … god , yes . '' \\n▁ i moved to pull down her underwear … but i was too late . \\n▁ with a muffled cry into my shoulder she hit her peak . \\n▁ seeing that , hearing that , knowing that i did that to her , well , damn if i did n't hit mine too . \\n▁ i gave up on her underwear and slumped over her body , groaning deep as i rode out the sensation with her . \\n▁ breathless , i pulled back to look at her . \\n▁ i stroked her hair back from her face and kissed her softly . \\n▁ ` ` god , lil , that was … but … we could have … '' she bit her lip and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not ready , lucas . '' \\n▁ now i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` but this is my dream . \\n▁ you 're still not ready , even in my dream ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc , i ' m sorry . \\n▁ at least i can give you this . '' \\n▁ she slung her hands around my neck as i rolled off to her side . \\n▁ she frowned as she looked me over . \\n▁ ` ` you should n't be dreaming of me , luc , especially like this . \\n▁ this wo n't help you move past me . '' \\n▁ i blinked at her , confused . \\n▁ ` ` why would i want to move past you ? '' \\n▁ i kissed her nose . \\n▁ ` ` i like being with you . \\n▁ this is better than anything that 's happening to me in the real world . \\n▁ if i could never wake up … i 'd be so happy . '' \\n▁ she immediately pulled away from me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't say that . '' \\n▁ she pushed me away from her and confused , i attempted to pull her back in towards me . \\n▁ nimbly , she slipped away and stood up at the side of the bed . \\n▁ ` ` do n't ever say that again . '' \\n▁ she put her hands on her h * ps in a way that was supposed to be threatening , but really , was just endearing . \\n▁ ` ` or i wo n't come back . '' \\n▁ she raised her chin defiantly and a soft chuckle escaped me . \\n▁ she narrowed her pale eyes at me until i conceded . \\n▁ ` ` fine . \\n▁ i hope i wake up soon and join the ranks of brooding teenagers worldwide . '' \\n▁ she smiled and then immediately frowned . \\n▁ ` ` oh … sorry . \\n▁ goodbye , lucas . '' \\n▁ ` ` goodbye ? \\n▁ what do you - '' a sharp , high pitched buzzing in my ear woke me from my dream and shattered my conversation with lillian . \\n▁ i slammed a hand down on the stupid alarm clock and looked over to where lil had been cutely standing with her hands on her hips . \\n▁ instead of the pitch black of night , a pale morning light lit my room … that was completely empty . \\n▁ i had n't expected to have a dream like that about her . \\n▁ grief welled in me but after a long moment , i managed to push it back . \\n▁ no , that had been nice , more than nice , and i was n't going to grieve over a nice memory . \\n▁ besides , it had felt so real … maybe i 'd found a way to be with her again . \\n▁ god , that sounded insane . \\n▁ but still , it felt so real . \\n▁ i 'd felt her body again . \\n▁ i 'd heard her moans again . \\n▁ i 'd watched her come under me . \\n▁ i 'd … oh , damn it . \\n▁ i carefully felt around myself and , sure enough , some things that happen in dreams also happen in real life . \\n▁ i sighed irritably and got up to take a shower . \\n▁ oh well , it was still a pleasant dream and i was n't about to cry over it . \\n▁ even still , i did let loose a couple tears in the shower . \\n▁ after cleaning and dressing , i shuffled out to the kitchen for a cup of coffee with mom . \\n▁ as per our usual routine , she asked me general questions of how things were going . \\n▁ i gave her general responses of things were going fine . \\n▁ school had been in session for a few weeks now and while the student body had n't exactly warmed up to me , i had become less of an object of interest and more of a forgotten relic in the back row . \\n▁ that suited me fine . \\n▁ if they were ignoring me , they would n't talk to me . \\n▁ and if they were n't talking to me , they would n't ask me painful questions that i did n't want to answer . \\n▁ questions that i 'd endured too often in that first week of school , when more of the kids like eliza and xxunk had become braver and flat out asked me if i -lrb- a -rrb- remembered anything and -lrb- b -rrb- was drunk . \\n▁ i always said no to both and hoped they dropped it . \\n▁ eventually they did and i faded into the back of their consciousness . \\n▁ everyone 's except josh and will 's that is . \\n▁ those two still picked on me relentlessly . \\n▁ will took every opportunity to make me look like an idiot , questioning the class loudly about my actions or even trying to cause me physical harm with more ` ` accidents '' . \\n▁ it was annoying , but i did my best to ignore it , hoping he would eventually bore of his game and give up . \\n▁ josh … he was still determined to kick my ass , but never seemed to have a free moment to do it . \\n▁ being new to the football team this year probably helped with keeping him occupied . \\n▁ it also helped that his girlfriend caught him with his hands all over some cheerleader 's ass after practice one day . \\n▁ i 'd heard that the fight was a blowout and would have made any fight between us seem civil in comparison . \\n▁ while i had nothing against josh 's girlfriend -lrb- she ignored me for the most part , that is , when she was n't pulling josh away from me -rrb- , i was glad for josh 's meandering hands . \\n▁ better him groping some cheerleader 's backside , than permanently damaging our friendship - if it was n't already . \\n▁ mom and i sipped our coffees in silence , facing each other at the tiny table in our tiny kitchen . \\n▁ her work had n't let up any and she still looked tired and haggard . \\n▁ i suppose a good chunk of that was her still worrying about me , about how i was xxunk with society . \\n▁ i wanted to assure her that everything was fine , so i tried to slap on a genuine smile around her . \\n▁ she did n't seem to buy it , but at the same time did n't argue with it , giving me my space to grieve . \\n▁ and i still was . \\n▁ my visions of my friends were n't leaving me . \\n▁ i remembered conversations with them around every corner of school . \\n▁ i remembered tackling darren on the front lawn , a rousing snowball fight with sammy , when a soft spattering on the ground had greeted us as we exited a class last year , and … i remembered lil . \\n▁ i sighed into my coffee cup as i set it down on the table . \\n▁ eventually , i 'd started adding her memories to the mix . \\n▁ hers hurt the most , of course , and they 'd been the most insistent to pop up . \\n▁ giving in , i 'd swallowed back the painful lump and let my memory of her wash over me . \\n▁ tears had stung my eyes the first few times it happened and sawyer 's calming hand on my arm would snap me out of whatever vision i 'd been lost in . \\n▁ but over time , the memories did n't cause me as much pain and visions of us together filtered through my day : leaning against the wall with her in my arms while we watched kids go by in the hall , chucking gummy bears at each other as we studied in the library , her teasing me with those tiny , tight shorts when i 'd come watch her finish up practice after my own was over with , her breath , her smell , her laugh , her eyes , her love … a love never spoken out loud , but evident in every move she made around me . \\n▁ but the most intense memories were in dream form and this morning was definitely the most intense of all of them . \\n▁ it was in dreams when she almost seemed alive again . \\n▁ if i was having a good one , we 'd spend it talking and laughing … and kissing . \\n▁ last night was a very good one . \\n▁ as strange as it sounds , i was starting to live for those moments when i was asleep . \\n▁ deep in thought , i turned my coffee cup in my hands . \\n▁ a short honk broke the silence and i startled and looked out the window . \\n▁ sawyer 's camaro was idling in the drive , just like it was every morning when she came to pick me up . \\n▁ i stood up and grabbed my bag after giving my mom a kiss on the head . \\n▁ she stood as well and walked with me to the door . \\n▁ ` ` have a good day , lucas . '' \\n▁ she smiled warmly , as her eyes drifted over my features . \\n▁ i paused , letting her soak me in , a momentary sadness filling me that she still felt the need to do that every time we parted ways . \\n▁ ` ` you too , mom . '' \\n▁ i gave her a brief hug and opened the door to meet sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` she could come in sometime , '' my mom said as i walked out the door . \\n▁ she peered her head outside and waved at sawyer 's form in the car . \\n▁ sawyer waved back . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't bite , '' she finished . \\n▁ i laughed and looked back at her . \\n▁ ` ` i know , mom . \\n▁ we 're just … running late . \\n▁ another time , okay ? '' \\n▁ she nodded and leaned in to kiss my cheek . \\n▁ i let her and then walked over to sawyer 's car and climbed inside . \\n▁ sawyer 's jet black hair was pulled back into a neat ponytail and my name across her back stood out clearly . \\n▁ i tried not to worry about that . \\n▁ the school had most definitely associated her with me now , since we were rarely apart , and if they picked on her for it , well , she never let me see more than the occasional frown and a quick swipe of an eye . \\n▁ her pale eyes looked past me , to my mom still watching from the door . \\n▁ she put the car in reverse and quietly said , ` ` your mom seems really nice . '' \\n▁ i leaned back in the now familiar bucket seat and looked over at her . \\n▁ ` ` she is . \\n▁ you should meet her sometime . '' \\n▁ she backed into the road and shifted her car into drive . \\n▁ ` ` umm … sure . \\n▁ maybe … sometime . '' \\n▁ she bit her lip . \\n▁ ` ` parents … make me nervous . '' \\n▁ she looked over at the smirk on my face and giggled , her ponytail bouncing with her laugh . \\n▁ i shook my head and smiled at her . \\n▁ she 'd resisted coming over to my house after school , even though i asked her nearly every day . \\n▁ she always said her parents wanted her home right away , after our ` ` purity club '' meetings , but i often wondered if she just did n't want to come over , and was using that as her excuse . \\n▁ when she picked me up in the morning , she always honked once for me , but never came in . \\n▁ my mom wondered about that too and i tried to give her plausible explanations … which were almost always ` we 're running late ' . \\n▁ i ' m sure my mom knew we had plenty of time for the relatively short drive , but she did n't question my answer . \\n▁ she rarely did . \\n▁ i turned my head to watch the town go by while sawyer turned the music up . \\n▁ i was n't sure what sawyer was so reluctant about , but i did n't press her on it . \\n▁ if she really wanted to come over , she would . \\n▁ and aside from the weekends , which pretty much consisted of me becoming one with my couch , we did spend a lot of time together , at school and after . \\n▁ we 'd both stuck with the club ; her , because her parents demanded it , for some reason , and me , because i liked spending time with her . \\n▁ there were meetings three times a week that usually turned into ` ` troubled teen '' group therapy sessions . \\n▁ sawyer and i usually tuned them out as we whispered away in the corner of the room , much to ms . reynolds 's annoyance . \\n▁ outside of those meetings , the club met twice a week at ` ` events '' . \\n▁ these were usually practices for one of the many sports teams , where the teachers seemed to think the problems stemmed from . \\n▁ unfortunately , these events brought me in close proximity with people who did n't much care for me , i.e. josh , randy , will and the rest of the football team . \\n▁ i hid on the back row of the bleachers with sawyer , while the rest of the club members walked up and down the field , trying in vain to recruit more members . \\n▁ i shook my head at the memory of josh glaring at me during the last event that happened to be his practice session . \\n▁ he 'd stared at me the entire time , like i 'd amassed this group of people personally , just to bug him . \\n▁ if coach had n't been there , eyeing me with almost as much interest as josh , since he still had n't managed to corner me into that ` ` talk '' he 'd wanted , i ' m sure josh would have tried to start something . \\n▁ sawyer noticed me shaking my head in the car . \\n▁ ` ` you alright ? '' \\n▁ she seemed to ask me some form of this question nearly every day . \\n▁ i smiled and looked back over at her . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m good . '' \\n▁ the only reason i put up with all of it , was to hang out more with her . \\n▁ our little purity club gave me an extra hour and a half with her and that was one more hour and a half that i did n't have to spend alone . \\n▁ she brought me so much comfort . \\n▁ i only wished i could return the favor . \\n▁ she looked over at me with a furrowed brow . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure ? \\n▁ did you have a bad dream again ? '' \\n▁ she said that last part quietly and i cringed internally . \\n▁ she had picked me up once when i 'd awoken late from a particularly bad dream , no , nightmare was a more appropriate description . \\n▁ i 'd still been a crying , blubbery mess when i 'd shuffled out to her car . \\n▁ mom had wanted to pull me that day , but i 'd wanted to be with sawyer , so i sucked it up and went to school . \\n▁ i 'd only been able to tell her that i 'd had a bad dream . \\n▁ sawyer had n't asked for any more details . \\n▁ she did n't need them . \\n▁ she knew that any dream i had that brought me to my knees , could only be about one thing - and she did n't need an explanation of that . \\n▁ i shook my head at her question . \\n▁ ` ` no , i had a pretty good dream . '' \\n▁ i flushed as i said that , remembering my steamy fantasy . \\n▁ sawyer looked at me curiously but thankfully did n't ask for any explanations on that either . \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ i 'd rather your dreams were nice . \\n▁ you should get a release somewhere . '' \\n▁ i bit my lip and looked out the window as my blush deepened . \\n▁ luckily , sawyer was looking back out the windshield and did n't notice . \\n▁ god , nice choice of words . \\n▁ i sighed softly , running through this morning again . \\n▁ that had been one real feeling dream . \\n▁ if separating from the dream had n't been painful , even though i tried to make it not be that way , i 'd damn near say that dream had been … amazing . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and leaned my head back on the seat , reliving that moment … reliving lil . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ sawyer 's voice startled me and i lifted my head to look around the school parking lot . \\n▁ i looked over to where her pale eyes were studying me ; her head cocked slightly , like she was wondering if i 'd left my body for awhile . \\n▁ i wondered how long we 'd been sitting here while i 'd been reminiscing over being with lillian again . \\n▁ my body had felt warm and safe in that dream . \\n▁ i shuddered a bit as the chill of the quiet car hit me and i wished i could crawl right back into that warm dream . \\n▁ ` ` sorry … spacing out . '' \\n▁ she looked about ready to ask if i was okay again and i interrupted her by cracking open my door and saying , ` ` ready ? '' \\n▁ she nodded and cracked her door as well . \\n▁ we both exited and made our way across campus to the main building for first period english . \\n▁ we still brought stares as people watched us , but no one said anything or did anything to bother us . \\n▁ we were noticed , almost distastefully , and then disregarded . \\n▁ i was relieved for that , but as i looked down on sawyer , i wondered if things would be better for her if she distanced herself from me too . \\n▁ maybe she 'd have more of a social life here if she was n't always hanging around the pariah . \\n▁ she looked back up at me and smiled warmly , seeming to not care in the least at the student body 's reaction , not if she got to walk with me . \\n▁ that 's what i liked to think that she thought anyway . \\n▁ forgetting that i should n't , for her sake , i slung my arm over her shoulder and pulled her tight to me as we walked . \\n▁ this morning had started pretty wonderfully and maybe i could relax today and let the rest of it be … well , not sucky would be an improvement . \\n▁ sawyer stiffened under my almost intimate move , but then relaxed and slung her arm around my waist . \\n▁ warmth seeped into me that strangely reminded me of my dream . \\n▁ before i could analyze it further though , i noticed josh and will . \\n▁ i could n't help but notice them … they were blocking our path . \\n▁ i stopped us and took a step in front of sawyer , breaking our contact . \\n▁ whatever these guys wanted , it had nothing to do with her and i would n't let them hurt her . \\n▁ i may have no desire to fight them , but i would if it meant protecting her . \\n▁ josh looked over my shoulder at sawyer and made a disgusted face . \\n▁ i bristled at the look and struggled to keep my anger in check . \\n▁ i did n't need to be the one starting something . \\n▁ i needed to get through this year in peace , with nothing too damaging on my record . \\n▁ ` ` what do you want , josh ? '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked over to will , wondering what role he 'd play in all this . \\n▁ he crossed his arms over his chest and smirked at me , but said nothing . \\n▁ a small circle of students started to form around us , feeling the tension building in the air and silently i cursed . \\n▁ if josh had n't planned on fighting me before , he might if he had an audience . \\n▁ but he would n't want to get kicked off the football team and coach had a strict policy on fighting . \\n▁ if he punched first … he was out . \\n▁ i straightened from where i 'd unknowingly been crouching in anticipation . \\n▁ he was n't going to attack me , not like this anyway . \\n▁ he could n't afford to . \\n▁ he sniffed and frowned as he seemed to realize this too . \\n▁ then a devilish smile lit his face with a dark glow . \\n▁ i swallowed under that look , wondering what it meant . \\n▁ ` ` have a good day at school , lucas . '' \\n▁ his brows rose meaningfully as his voice darkened to match his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` you deserve it . '' \\n▁ then he turned and brushed past , bumping my shoulder harshly and jostling me back a step into sawyer . \\n▁ i risked a quick glance at her and she looked about ready to go off on josh , if not outright assault him . \\n▁ i did n't want her getting into trouble for me and quickly shook my head at her when our eyes met . \\n▁ she understood and bit her lip to remain quiet , her arms crossing over her chest defiantly . \\n▁ i looked back to see will uncrossing his arms and straightening in his stance in front of me . \\n▁ he stood there with a crooked grin as he watched me . \\n▁ he did n't make any threatening move towards sawyer or me , just continued to stand there . \\n▁ feeling uneasy but wanting to leave , i carefully walked around him . \\n▁ i should have expected it , i really should have . \\n▁ i did know he had the maturity level of a xxunk , but i 'd truthfully been more concerned over the dark expression on josh 's face - that had definitely meant something - and i did n't notice will 's foot . \\n▁ i did n't catch it rapidly snaking out to catch mine and he did have fast feet . \\n▁ that made him a good replacement for me on the football field . \\n▁ unfortunately , it was also my downfall this morning … literally . \\n▁ i caught the edge of his toes with mine and stumbled . \\n▁ he raised his foot higher and i felt myself losing balance . \\n▁ before i lost it completely , a shoulder went under my arm and a hand steadied my chest . \\n▁ i fumbled a bit , but managed to not fall . \\n▁ my face heated anyway as the small circle still loitering , hoping for a fight , found my near trip - up hilarious . \\n▁ sawyer did not . \\n▁ after completely steadying me , she dropped her bag at my feet and shoved both hands into a laughing will 's chest . \\n▁ ` ` grow up you son of a bitch ! '' \\n▁ he started at the unexpected outburst and then his face clouded in anger . \\n▁ he stepped into her attack and leered down at her . \\n▁ ` ` oh , the xxunk whore has a voice . '' \\n▁ he looked like he wanted to shove her back , but did n't go so far as to start something with a girl . \\n▁ instead , he held her wrists down and looked over her wildly thrashing body to me , standing dazed behind her . \\n▁ ` ` getting your slut to fight your battles for you , luc ? '' \\n▁ he rocked his h * ps towards her suggestively . \\n▁ ` ` maybe i should tap this too . \\n▁ she 's kind of hot , in a fiery , bitchy sort of way . '' \\n▁ he looked back at her with a leer while the students around laughed even harder . \\n▁ seriously , where was a teacher when you needed one ? \\n▁ my face heated more , but in anger this time . \\n▁ i took a step towards will , already bringing my arm back for the strike i was committed to . \\n▁ i 'd get in trouble to protect her . \\n▁ sawyer did n't need me to though . \\n▁ she managed to wrench an arm free and flat out decked him . \\n▁ no girly slap across the face , she clenched her hand into a tight fist and socked him right in the jaw . \\n▁ he released her , stepping back in shock and bringing a hand up to rub his injury . \\n▁ his eyes held pure fury now . \\n▁ sawyer took a step away from him , massaging her hand . \\n▁ i took advantage of the space between them and stepped up to will , shoving him farther back from sawyer with both of my hands against his chest . \\n▁ ` ` gon na hit a girl now , will ? \\n▁ is that where you 're going ? \\n▁ coach would love that … wonder how long you 'll stay quarterback . '' \\n▁ will paled as my words registered with him , and suddenly realizing that fighting sawyer , or me , was not in his best interest , he spat at my feet and turned , trudging his way to the main building . \\n▁ i sighed softly as i watched him leave . \\n▁ we 'd just be seeing him again in a few minutes ; one of the major drawbacks of attending a small school . \\n▁ so much for my not sucky day . \\n▁ well , maybe the worst was over with . \\n▁ sawyer came up behind me and put a hand on my arm . \\n▁ the crowd around us began to disperse as people started to realize that no one , meaning me , was going to get knocked to the ground . \\n▁ i looked over at sawyer and her hand that had to be aching . \\n▁ i pointed at it . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? \\n▁ want to stop by the nurses ' station ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i ' m fine . '' \\n▁ she smiled impishly . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not my first time hitting an a * * hole . '' \\n▁ i raised an eyebrow at that and she laughed a little at my look . \\n▁ she nodded towards the front doors and with another sigh , i nodded and reached down to grab her bag for her . \\n▁ then we both continued on to first period english . \\n▁ we got some looks as we headed down the hall but we ignored them ; we were used to looks . \\n▁ true , the kids were slightly more interested in us now than they had been of late , thanks to josh and will 's testosterone display outside , but if sawyer and i were getting good at anything , it was tuning the world out . \\n▁ trudging up the stairs , i noticed her still rubbing her hand . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure you 're alright , '' i asked , as i reached over and grabbed her hand , taking over the massage . \\n▁ she looked up at me and then down at our hands for a long moment before she answered . \\n▁ ` ` sure , it feels better already . '' \\n▁ she looked back up at me and grinned . \\n▁ ` ` totally worth it . '' \\n▁ i grinned back and gave her a brief hug around the shoulders , releasing her hand . \\n▁ ` ` well , thank you for your valiant attempt to defend my honor . '' \\n▁ i smirked when i said that , momentarily remembering a dream version of lil threatening to beat up josh . \\n▁ lil would probably love sawyer for clocking will . \\n▁ coming to the top of the steps , sawyer stopped and looked over my face . \\n▁ perhaps misinterpreting my expression , she frowned softly . \\n▁ ` ` i just cost you cool points , did n't i ? '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you think i still have cool points ? \\n▁ i ' m pretty sure i lost all of those when i kill … '' i closed my mouth and bit my lip . \\n▁ when i killed all my friends , their friends . \\n▁ sawyer 's eyes widened as what i had n't finished saying registered with her . \\n▁ she started shaking her head and had an expression of ` do n't talk like that ' clearly written on her face . \\n▁ before the after school special could begin , i grabbed her hand and led her to english . \\n▁ she did n't like it when i said stuff like that … truth was hard , but , i did n't need a lecture this morning . \\n▁ i 'd be getting enough of those by the teachers . \\n▁ not resisting my pull to class , and still having an ' i want to talk to you ' look on her face , sawyer and i entered the room together , hand in hand . \\n▁ several sets of eyes tracked the intimate movement , a move around here generally reserved for boyfriend / girlfriend behavior . \\n▁ but we were n't , it was different with us . \\n▁ i did n't want to care what the students here thought , hell , i was pretty sure they all thought we were sleeping together anyway , but i did care about sawyer getting picked on , so i dropped her hand and made a beeline to my seat , carefully avoiding a stormy looking will . \\n▁ i looked over at sawyer as she sat in the back row with me ; she studiously ignored me , studying her desk . \\n▁ i was n't sure what that meant . \\n▁ was she still thinking about things to say to me ? \\n▁ i hoped not , i did n't need a lesson on cheeriness . \\n▁ she usually did n't try to offer me any either . \\n▁ she just seemed to instinctually know when to press and when to back off , when to ask me questions and when to walk away . \\n▁ but right now , she did look like something was troubling her . \\n▁ ms . reynolds started class , giving us details on a pep rally today after last period . \\n▁ all classes were going to be fifteen minutes shorter so we could all gather together in the gym to celebrate the ` ` ca n't miss '' football game of the season against our school rivals -lrb- meaning they happen to be the closest school next to us and had been deemed ` ` the enemy '' -rrb- . \\n▁ i tried to ignore ms . reynolds 's speech about how great the game will be and how school spirit can make you feel like a part of something bigger . \\n▁ i had been a part of something bigger , and a part of me still missed that . \\n▁ i missed the games and the camaraderie of the team . \\n▁ i missed darren sitting beside me on the bench , waiting for our turn on the field so he could score the winning touchdown . \\n▁ well , that 's how he always thought the game was going to end . \\n▁ focusing back to the present , i twisted in my seat to face sawyer . \\n▁ she heard my movement and looked over . \\n▁ ` what 's up ? ' \\n▁ i mouthed to her . \\n▁ she shook her head and i frowned . \\n▁ she looked down real quick and then back up at me . \\n▁ ` nothing ' , she mouthed . \\n▁ i frowned harder and crossed my arms and she sighed . \\n▁ she held out her palm and i glanced at it and back to her , cocking my head , confused . \\n▁ she sighed softly again while ms . reynolds prattled on about school pride and the joy of experiencing it ` ` substance free '' . \\n▁ ` you dropped it ' , she mouthed , as she pointed to her hand . \\n▁ i was hopelessly confused until i realized what she meant . \\n▁ i 'd dropped her hand as the students had been staring at us . \\n▁ i suppose that could have looked like rejection to her … especially if she thought we were more than just close friends . \\n▁ damn , i really did n't want to have that awkward conversation , but i really could n't let her go on thinking anything was between us ; nothing more than a close , almost familial bond that i could n't bear to have taken from me . \\n▁ i loved her … just not like that . \\n▁ my heart was still lil 's . \\n▁ i started to speak , breaking our silent speech so i could break her heart , if she had fallen for me . \\n▁ she beat me to it however . \\n▁ ` ` are you … mad at me ? '' \\n▁ she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` did i do something wrong ? '' \\n▁ i cocked my head , confused again at the shift in the way the conversation was going . \\n▁ i 'd hurt her feelings , made her think i was angry ? \\n▁ i immediately shook my head once i realized where hers was at . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ with only my eyes , i indicated the room . \\n▁ ` ` everyone was staring at us , at you . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't want them looking at you like that , whispering about you , about us . '' \\n▁ she laughed quietly and her entire face relaxed as she realized i had no bad feelings toward her . \\n▁ ` ` luc , they already talk about us . '' \\n▁ she shrugged her shoulders like it did n't matter . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve already been pregnant , had a miscarriage and begged you to marry me . '' \\n▁ she leaned in while my eyes widened ; i 'd assumed we 'd been linked sexually , but i had n't actually heard the rumors . \\n▁ only the ones about my lack of sobriety seemed to make it to me . \\n▁ maybe i was just starting to tune out ones that did n't revolve solely around me . \\n▁ wow , how narcissistic . \\n▁ sawyer continued when i leaned over to her , ` ` from what i hear , mr . varner caught us full on hav * * g s * x in the first floor men 's room after school one afternoon . '' \\n▁ she giggled a little while my mouth dropped ; these rumors were much more sordid than i 'd imagined they 'd be . \\n▁ ` ` of course , then the rumors say he joined us . '' \\n▁ i laughed out loud to that and got a firm reprimand from ms . reynolds while sawyer chuckled softly beside me . \\n▁ muttering an apology to the teacher , i glanced over at where sawyer was still laughing . \\n▁ she met my eye and the genuine happiness in her pale , gray ones lifted my spirits back up . \\n▁ this morning did n't matter , because here was one human being that looked at me , not only like i was worthwhile , but looked at me like i was the most worthwhile person in the school . \\n▁ as we went about our english class , i thought over the rumors circulating about us and wondered what i could do about them . \\n▁ it did n't seem to bother sawyer in the slightest , but i really did n't want her to suffer here because of me … and the nature of the rumors . \\n▁ i caught sawyer glancing up at me a few times during class and thought her expression was close to one lil used to give me , almost dreamy . \\n▁ maybe we 'd have to have that awkward conversation after all . \\n▁ as we parted ways for the next class , i started to wonder how to bring it up to her . \\n▁ maybe i should talk to my mom first . \\n▁ she 'd been a looker in her youth , and had probably had to swat more than one suitor away . \\n▁ not that i was a looker … although , before lillian , i 'd had my share of girls with crushes . \\n▁ there was this one girl who used to hang out by my locker every day . \\n▁ it used to make darren laugh really hard , and he 'd always teased me to kiss her . \\n▁ he seemed to think that would make her faint and he 'd really wanted to see that . \\n▁ sammy had smacked him roughly when she 'd eventually heard him say that and calmly walked right up to the girl . \\n▁ she 'd said a few sentences to her and the girl had nodded and walked off , never to haunt my locker again . \\n▁ i still to this day , have no idea what sammy said to her . \\n▁ i could use a little of sammy 's magic now . \\n▁ but sawyer did n't strike me as one of those types , one to crush on a boy simply because he was attractive . \\n▁ maybe i was wrong about the occasional feeling i got from her . \\n▁ i 'd never been friends with a girl before . \\n▁ i mean , sammy and i were friends , but i 'd been friends with darren first and she and i 's friendship had been born out of their attraction to each other , and the fact that darren had hardly gone anywhere without her . \\n▁ not liking sammy had just never been an option , not if i wanted to stay friends with darren . \\n▁ but i had genuinely liked her , everyone did . \\n▁ she was my only real experience with girl friendships . \\n▁ maybe i was just reading too much into it . \\n▁ maybe i was starting to let the rumors warp the way i imagined she felt about me . \\n▁ wow , there 's that narcissism again . \\n▁ i 'll have to work on that . \\n▁ by the time i met up with sawyer again , i 'd gotten over myself , and any weirdness between us was completely gone . \\n▁ we were just the normal , friend - only couple that we always were . \\n▁ and i was happy . \\n▁ my happiness stayed with me all the way through mr . varner 's class , even surviving a blushing incident when i caught a couple girls staring at the teacher and then back at sawyer and me . \\n▁ now that i knew what their smirk meant , i 'd blushed furiously and studied my desk for a good twenty minutes , probably confirming their suspicions . \\n▁ sawyer chuckled beside me , apparently catching the whole exchange . \\n▁ my good feelings stayed with me all through philosophy , and math and lunch in sawyer 's car . \\n▁ it stayed with me right up until the point where i had a class with josh . \\n▁ then it sort of faded from me . \\n▁ well , faded is too relaxed of a word . \\n▁ it was forcefully crashed out of me by josh forcefully slamming into me . \\n▁ when i 'd walked into astronomy , the teacher , mr . thomson , had been absent , running late to class , or off on some quick errand . \\n▁ either way , he 'd left this particular group of students alone . \\n▁ i should have immediately noticed something was wrong by the multiple sets of eyes watching me through the windows as i walked up to the door . \\n▁ that should have registered something with me , but i was so used to people eyeing me , that it did n't even faze me . \\n▁ what happened next did . \\n▁ i opened the door like normal and it shut behind me like normal . \\n▁ that was when normalcy stopped . \\n▁ i 'd walked a few feet into the room when a ` ` hut - hut '' was sounded down one of the aisles . \\n▁ i turned my head to register randy making the sound , a wicked grin on his face . \\n▁ i was n't sure why until i was hit full force in the chest , landing heavily on the cold tile of the floor . \\n▁ the wind was knocked out of me and my head slammed back painfully , with a crack that surely the person in the last row heard . \\n▁ my hazy vision picked out the form of josh sneering at me on my chest , pressing down with all his weight so i still could n't inhale . \\n▁ i could n't breathe and my sight was shifting from hazy to gray to black around the edges . \\n▁ i was going to pass out . \\n▁ with a pained grunt , i shoved at josh as hard as i could . \\n▁ i was weak and hurting from the sudden attack , but josh was smaller than me and i was starting to panic from lack of air . \\n▁ eventually , i did get him pushed off and that sweet oxygen filled my lungs almost painfully . \\n▁ my vision returned slowly … along with my hearing . \\n▁ instead of the sound of blood whooshing through my ears and throbbing in my head , i heard laughter , what sounded like the entire room laughing . \\n▁ josh was standing in front of me , bent over from laughing so hard and i carefully looked around . \\n▁ i noticed most , but not all , were laughing along with him . \\n▁ i rubbed my head and sat up , trying to steady my breath . \\n▁ panicked voices started from the back and filtered up to me . \\n▁ people started shifting and sitting in the seats , still struggling with giggles . \\n▁ i started to stand when josh walked over and shoved me back down before heading to his seat . \\n▁ my dazed body could n't respond fast enough to stop him and i sat back down heavily . \\n▁ ` ` fuck you , josh , '' i said harshly … right as the teacher entered the room . \\n▁ ` ` lucas west ! \\n▁ watch your language or you 'll go straight to detention ! \\n▁ and get off the floor . '' \\n▁ mr . thomson looked annoyed , for quite possibly the first time i 'd ever seen and i , as hastily as i could , stood up and grabbed my bag from where it had fallen from my shoulder and crashed to the ground , some of its contents spilling out to the floor . \\n▁ i gingerly made my way to my seat , wondering what part of my body hurt worse , my head or my hip . \\n▁ my ego was n't a problem anymore ; it remained firmly attached to the cold , tile floor . \\n▁ not that i 'd had much left to begin with , but still , the entire class laughing at me looking , once again , like a moron … well , it sucked . \\n▁ i kept my eyes firmly cast on my textbook all throughout the lecture while the occasional bout of giggling popped up around the classroom . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ how had i ever thought today was even a semi - happy day ? \\n▁ i waited in my seat until all of class shuffled out afterwards . \\n▁ josh and randy snickered as they left , josh throwing me a devilish smile . \\n▁ i hoped whatever he 'd felt i 'd ` ` deserved '' had been accomplished , and he 'd leave me alone for awhile . \\n▁ the teacher gave me a last reproachful look as i left his room , muttering an apology for my earlier outburst . \\n▁ with no one staying behind to further torment me , i made my way to art class in peace . \\n▁ we 'd finished our ` ` feels like home '' projects awhile ago and i 'd turned in a nice portrait of sawyer that had actually earned me an a . \\n▁ last year , i 'd planned on art being an easy , goofing off together class for darren , sammy , lil and me , but i found that i actually had a skill in it . \\n▁ mrs . xxunk praised whatever piece i turned in , offering a few suggestions and helpful comments , although she still , more often than not , called me tom . \\n▁ i even found myself responding to the name on more than a few occasions . \\n▁ currently , we were working on abstract art , and i found myself working in varying shades of gray that highly complimented sawyer 's eyes . \\n▁ i usually painted or drew something that reminded me of her ; it made the class more enjoyable for me than trying to channel my artistic feelings toward my long gone friends . \\n▁ sawyer was peace . \\n▁ sawyer was comfort . \\n▁ and i hoped against all hope that when i saw sawyer after class , she 'd have something to help with the splitting headache that josh had given me when he smacked my skull into the floor . \\n▁ mrs . xxunk walked around the class while other students diligently worked on their projects , offering tips for emphasizing the style . \\n▁ she passed by me and patted my shoulder , muttering , ` ` good work , tom , '' and i smiled and bit back a chuckle as she continued walking through the room . \\n▁ halfway through the class , i felt like dying . \\n▁ a tender spot on the back of my head was throbbing , and every pulse of blood made my forehead feel like it was trying to expand outwards … and failing . \\n▁ i was sure something inside of me was broken . \\n▁ biting my lip and stopping myself from asking for a pass to see the nurse , i somehow made it through the rest of that class . \\n▁ i shuffled out , rubbing my temples , and came upon sawyer outside of the building , waiting for me . \\n▁ her jet black hair was still in a sleek ponytail and she had her hands shoved in my letterman 's jacket pockets . \\n▁ she was looking back at the choir room , chewing a piece of gum and watching brittany leave the class with a handful of fawning girls , most of them in their cheerleader outfits for the pep rally . \\n▁ i walked up beside her and glumly said , ` ` hey '' . \\n▁ she startled from whatever she was thinking about and looked over at my cringing face . \\n▁ ` ` god , you look like shit . \\n▁ what happened ? '' \\n▁ her brows scrunched as she searched for some external injury . \\n▁ i sighed and squeezed the bridge of my nose , hoping to somehow stop the pounding . \\n▁ ` ` oh , i just had a run - in … with the floor . '' \\n▁ ` ` the floor ? \\n▁ huh ? '' \\n▁ i dropped my hand from my nose and adjusted the strap of my backpack on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` it was nothing , just josh proving that he 's big man on campus now … and he hates my guts . '' \\n▁ i shook my head angrily , which caused pain to slice all the way down my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` nothing i did n't already know . '' \\n▁ her mouth dropped as she gaped at me . \\n▁ ` ` he finally attacked you ? \\n▁ in class ? '' \\n▁ her hands came to my head , feeling around for bumps . \\n▁ i sucked in a breath when she found the tender spot on the back . \\n▁ i gently removed her hands . \\n▁ ` ` it 's fine . \\n▁ he just , sort of tackled me and i smacked my head . \\n▁ i ' m fine , really . \\n▁ it was more embarrassing than anything , him catching me off guard like that . '' \\n▁ her jaw set in anger and for a moment i worried that she was going to try and find josh , to get even or something . \\n▁ ` ` that little prick ! '' \\n▁ then her face relaxed as she looked over me again . \\n▁ ` ` we should get you to the nurse , you could have a concussion . '' \\n▁ i laughed softly and she twisted her lips at me . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think he hit me that hard . \\n▁ i could use some advil or something . \\n▁ i have a raging headache . '' \\n▁ her face brightened . \\n▁ ` ` oh , i have aspirin . '' \\n▁ she dug through her bag while i reached back in mine and grabbed the half empty water bottle from my lunch . \\n▁ she found a little white container and opening it , dug out a couple . \\n▁ i popped them without looking and swigged my water . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , '' i muttered after polishing off the rest of my water . \\n▁ my body hoped the damn things kicked in soon . \\n▁ ` ` sure . '' \\n▁ she looked over me again , almost looking like my mom for a moment , and then she grabbed my elbow and pulled me toward the gym . \\n▁ i looked at her weird and she sighed , then explained . \\n▁ ` ` the purity club is promoting safety at the rally . \\n▁ we 're all supposed to be there , encouraging kids to join in the ` clean ' fun . '' \\n▁ she twisted her lips and looked glum as she pulled me towards the rally . \\n▁ ` ` and why are n't we just skipping it ? '' \\n▁ i asked , equally as glum . \\n▁ ` ` because my parents found out about it and think it 's a great idea . '' \\n▁ she looked at me dryly . \\n▁ ` ` they told ms . reynolds to call if i ditched . '' \\n▁ she rolled her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` apparently , she agreed . '' \\n▁ now i rolled my eyes , but followed her . \\n▁ if she had to sit through hell , i 'd sit with her . \\n▁ we entered the gym and i took in the familiarity of it with a pang . \\n▁ i had n't been in here yet this year . \\n▁ i clearly saw a remembered version of darren and sammy and lil goofing off on one of the bleachers that lined the lacquered floor . \\n▁ darren was standing on the floor in front of them , proudly wearing his football jersey , cupping his hands and shouting at the cheerleaders to flip their skirts up . \\n▁ sammy , sitting on the bleacher behind him , smacked his ass , laughing at his display , and rolling her eyes at lillian , who was laughing beside her and waving across the gym to where i 'd been about to walk over to them in my memory . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ i looked over at sawyer watching me . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? \\n▁ does your head feel better ? '' \\n▁ i smiled lazily and nodded . \\n▁ actually , my headache was receding . \\n▁ actually , i was starting to feel really nice , almost light and airy . \\n▁ i smiled wider and put my hand on her shoulder . \\n▁ she nodded back at me and we started walking down the line of bleachers to the end . \\n▁ i heard several derogatory shouts being made at me , both coming from the stands and the floor , where the team was gathering for the event , but i ignored them . \\n▁ i felt nice and i was going to hold on to that feeling for as long as i could . \\n▁ there were enough teachers and staff around that we made it to the far side of the gym without being accosted . \\n▁ we waved at ms . reynolds as we passed her , so she 'd know we were here , then we snuck past the other purity club members and ducked into the slim space between the last section of bleachers and the wall . \\n▁ once there , we slumped against the wall to sit on the floor . \\n▁ i leaned my head back and closed my eyes , waiting for the swelling of school spirit to be over with . \\n▁ resting like that , my head started to swim and i felt a little dizzy as the music of the band piped up and was answered with a resounding roar from the student body . \\n▁ the students on the bleachers directly across from where we were sitting on the floor starting hollering and stomping their feet ; the pep rally had begun . \\n▁ i suddenly did n't care that we were here … here was nice . \\n▁ as the sounds of someone on a microphone introducing members of the team filled my ears , i reached over and grabbed sawyer 's hand . \\n▁ i smiled as my head drifted into a pleasant fog … here was very nice . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; ` ` wow , you 're perfect , '' i whispered , my voice feeling slow and slightly slurred . \\n▁ i leaned in closer to her , her breath light on my face as she watched me with wide eyes . \\n▁ ` ` your skin is so soft , like flower petals . '' \\n▁ my fingers traced her liquid cheeks , forehead , down the line of her nose , across the fullness of her lips . \\n▁ she inhaled a quick breath at that and i tracked the movement of those lips , mesmerized . \\n▁ i leaned in even closer to her and her scent hit me ; a sweet , light perfume that made my mouth water . \\n▁ ` ` you even smell like flowers . '' \\n▁ i leaned in even closer until our noses touched , my hands still caressing her features . \\n▁ the heat of our flesh together burned all the way through my body , scorched me in sensitive places . \\n▁ ` ` i wonder how you 'd taste … '' i leaned in even closer , inching my lips to her full ones . \\n▁ anticipation filled the space between us and her light breath on my skin stopped . \\n▁ heat rushed through my body and every part of me felt light and airy , carefree … fearless . \\n▁ i giggled at the feeling and then our lips finally brushed together . \\n▁ she sighed into my skin as we met . \\n▁ oh , wow . \\n▁ her skin was nothing in comparison to that soft flesh . \\n▁ i wanted more . \\n▁ i wanted that softness everywhere on me . \\n▁ i wanted it now . \\n▁ i moved my hand around to her neck and forcefully pulled her into me , shifting our heads so i could part our lips and sneak my tongue inside her . \\n▁ i was harsh in my eagerness and she pulled away from me . \\n▁ or tried to , i had a firm grasp on her neck and pulled her back in . \\n▁ i pushed my tongue back in her mouth , tasting her again . \\n▁ she was heaven . \\n▁ she was sweet and soft and enticing and arousing and i wanted so much more . \\n▁ ` ` stop it , luc ! '' \\n▁ my world suddenly shifted backward and confused , i blinked and looked around . \\n▁ sawyer 's mouth was no longer on mine . \\n▁ in fact , she was about two feet away from me , scrunched farther back along the wall , breathing heavily , and looking at me like i was a stranger . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong with you , '' she asked between pants . \\n▁ i stood up and scrambled away from her . \\n▁ there was nothing wrong with me . \\n▁ my body disagreed . \\n▁ the sudden movement of standing made my head go dizzy and then black . \\n▁ i fell to my knees and landed harshly on the wood of the gym . \\n▁ my breath came out in a rush as my hands fell to my knees . \\n▁ i took a deep , steadying breath and felt small hands clutching my shoulders . \\n▁ sound rushed to my ears - sounds of the noisy gym , sounds of the band , sounds of the cheerleaders ' chants , sounds of sawyer , asking me something over and over again . \\n▁ my head could n't separate the pieces . \\n▁ i started to panic . \\n▁ when my vision started to clear , i stood up more slowly . \\n▁ but my vision swam and twisted almost violently . \\n▁ i could n't focus on one object for long . \\n▁ i saw sawyer , looking concerned , and then she shifted to bleachers and blues and whites and a sea of multi - colored shirts . \\n▁ it was making me nauseous . \\n▁ i backed away , away from the bleachers . \\n▁ sawyer tried to grab my shirt , to stop me , but i pushed her hands away and hurriedly backed up … onto the court . \\n▁ the light of the full gym hit me and my eyes felt like watering . \\n▁ i looked over a sea of faces , not recognizing any of them and clutched my head , trying to stop the spinning . \\n▁ i could n't . \\n▁ i started breathing heavier and backed further away , until a giant hoop hovered over my head . \\n▁ i thought i heard my name and laughter , but language was mumbling before reaching my ears and i could n't make sense of anything . \\n▁ a long , black ponytail filled my vision , but i was suddenly twisted and facing a short , pixie cut of brown hair . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ arms pulled me back towards the bleachers and i stumbled along , my feet suddenly too big for my body . \\n▁ the short hair in front of me turned to the black hair beside me . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong with him , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ concern filled both faces and as my head stabilized in one position , i made out ms . reynolds in front of me , her slim arms over mine , her svelte body close to me , and my hand hanging tantalizingly close to her hip . \\n▁ a surprising fire shot through me at her nearness . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ he said he had a headache earlier … ? '' \\n▁ i stepped even closer to ms . reynolds and brought my arms around her waist . \\n▁ she was slim and curvy and warm . \\n▁ she made me warm . \\n▁ ` ` hey , ms . reynolds . \\n▁ god , you 're hot , totally xxunk . '' \\n▁ i leaned into her , so our heads were touching . \\n▁ my words were still slurred and slow , but she apparently heard me just fine … along with everyone in the bleachers near us . \\n▁ a simultaneous gasp echoed around me and ms . reynolds pulled back and went about three shades of red . \\n▁ just as my sluggish head was wondering what i 'd said that was so wrong , ms . reynolds brought her hand up like she was going to slap me . \\n▁ i blinked and tried to focus on her hand and then the hand relaxed and dropped back down to her side . \\n▁ not saying a word , she extracted herself from where i still had my arms around her and grabbed my wrist , dragging me out of the gym . \\n▁ we passed all of the bleachers again on our way out , but i barely noticed . \\n▁ i could only stare entranced at the lines of the laminate on the ground , while i stumbled and tripped my way after her . \\n▁ and then suddenly , i was falling . \\n▁ i had no reflexes to speak of , and no way to catch myself , and i landed heavily on the side of my face . \\n▁ oddly , i did n't feel the impact . \\n▁ i only felt the coolness of the ground beneath me . \\n▁ it actually felt a little nice against my slightly heated skin , so i giggled and stayed where i was along the ground . \\n▁ other giggling sounds filled my ears and i laughed harder , thinking we all sounded nice together . \\n▁ then , roughly , a pair of arms was under me and i was being lifted into the air . \\n▁ the sudden movement made my head swim and my stomach lurk . \\n▁ i tried to vomit , but nothing came out and i groaned . \\n▁ as i was righted the upset feeling passed and i breathed out a quick sigh of relief . \\n▁ then i was shoved forward . \\n▁ someone behind me said something along the lines of ` ` be gentle '' and then firm hands were on my shoulders and i was being guided out of the room . \\n▁ as the door closed behind me , a mass chorus of laughter broke out . \\n▁ i thought it sounded beautiful , and turned to head back to the sound . \\n▁ i was forcefully re - routed and made to walk down steps and another set of doors , to a chill that made me shiver . \\n▁ ` ` what 's wrong with him ? '' \\n▁ a black head spoke these words beside me and a warm hand clamped over mine . \\n▁ i held it tight , savoring the heat as the sudden iciness around me made my teeth chatter . \\n▁ ` ` he 's obviously drunk , miss smith … are you ? '' \\n▁ a deep voice behind me said that and i tried to place the voice . \\n▁ ` ` no , mr . varner … and he is n't either . \\n▁ i ' ve been with him most of the day and he has n't been drinking . '' \\n▁ i leaned my head into the voice speaking beside me ; it was beautiful … like an angel 's . \\n▁ the deep , male voice behind me continued , ` ` most of the day - not all . \\n▁ he could have sneaked something into his last class . '' \\n▁ hands lightly pushed my shoulders and i tripped up on my huge feet , almost stumbling to the harsh looking concrete , before those hands shifted to underneath my shoulders , keeping me upright . \\n▁ the warm hand in mine was joined by its mate and i turned my head to stare at a beautiful set of gray eyes … angel eyes , i was sure . \\n▁ i smiled warmly at her and she frowned slightly . \\n▁ had i upset my angel ? \\n▁ the gray eyes flicked from my face to the voice 's , behind me . \\n▁ ` ` we 'd be able to smell it if he had , and he did n't . \\n▁ i ' m telling you , he was fine before the pep rally . '' \\n▁ her bottom lip stuck out in a perfect pout and i stopped walking . \\n▁ i wanted to feel that lip again . \\n▁ so soft . \\n▁ i leaned in to make contact with her and was harshly shoved forward , my feet stumbling , and only the strong arms under me , saving me from the cold ground , yet again . \\n▁ a long , exasperated sigh sounded from my helper behind me . \\n▁ ` ` well , he snuck something on the way there . \\n▁ he 's obviously not fine now . '' \\n▁ the warm hand returned to mine from where it had been jostled free . \\n▁ i clenched it , never wanting that warmth to leave me . \\n▁ the black hair shook side to side while my angel spoke , ` ` no , he did n't . \\n▁ he only had aspirin … just … just aspirin . '' \\n▁ another long sigh behind me and a surprisingly feminine sigh on the other side of me . \\n▁ ` ` right … strong aspirin then . '' \\n▁ a hand was taken from supporting me and pointed out between my angel and me , to a distance that seemed so far from me , it could have been a different continent . \\n▁ ` ` go home , miss smith , ms . reynolds and i will take care of this . '' \\n▁ i tried to copy the pointing movement , and automatically fell back into the strong chest behind me . \\n▁ i was shoved forward and the hand returned to my shoulder . \\n▁ the sigh returned as well . \\n▁ ` ` no , i want to stay with him . '' \\n▁ my angel 's voice was sweet in my ear as she leaned close to me . \\n▁ i turned my head and tried to rest mine on her shoulder , but tripped over a rock instead , and nearly plummeted to the ground again . \\n▁ the voice behind me got stern as hands righted me again . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't asking … go home ! '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , sir . '' \\n▁ very reluctantly , the warm hand pulled away from me . \\n▁ i panicked . \\n▁ no , my angel could n't leave me . \\n▁ she made everything okay . \\n▁ my life was okay because of her . \\n▁ if she left me , the darkness would settle in … i knew it . \\n▁ somehow , it was the only thing my frazzled brain knew for sure - she could n't leave me . \\n▁ i pulled away from the strong hands behind me and flung my arms around my angel 's waist . \\n▁ ` ` no , no , no , no … please do n't send her away . \\n▁ please do n't send my angel away . '' \\n▁ hands tried to pull me off and i fought against them with every uncoordinated muscle i had . \\n▁ tender hands swept my face and a soothing voice cooed that everything would be okay , but everything would n't be okay , not if she left . \\n▁ i started to cry . \\n▁ ` ` please , god … no . \\n▁ do n't take her too . \\n▁ i need her . \\n▁ please do n't take her away from me too . \\n▁ you take everyone away . '' \\n▁ my arms cinched tight around her and i started to sob mercilessly into her shoulder . \\n▁ the strong hands stopped trying to separate me from my comfort and soft hands ran up and down my back soothingly . \\n▁ another set of hands lightly brushed my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , lucas . \\n▁ she can stay with you … at least until your mom gets here . \\n▁ it 's okay . '' \\n▁ my sobs eased as two sets of small hands eased the ache of sudden loneliness in my body . \\n▁ my head relaxed into an even fog of semi - peace and i pulled my head from my angel 's damp shoulder to see her face . \\n▁ her cheeks were as wet as mine felt . \\n▁ i frowned and cupped them in my hands . \\n▁ ` ` no … do n't cry . \\n▁ angels do n't cry . '' \\n▁ we stared at each other for a moment , her gray eyes flicking over my face , looking concerned and scared . \\n▁ i felt a happiness surge deep within me and longed to share it with her . \\n▁ still cupping her face , i leaned in close . \\n▁ ` ` i love you . \\n▁ you mean everything to me … everything . '' \\n▁ joy overwhelmed me and i leaned in to feel that softness of her lips again . \\n▁ rough hands pulled me back and got me walking toward a boring looking building . \\n▁ ` ` jonathan , be careful with him . '' \\n▁ the other feminine voice sounded displeased at the male one behind me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's getting cold , just standing around out here . \\n▁ i ' m not just gon na stay in this while these two make out . \\n▁ i 'd like to get home sometime tonight . '' \\n▁ hands shoved me forward and i reached out for my solace . \\n▁ she reached back , easily catching up to my shuffling form and clutching my hand tight . \\n▁ all was right with the world , with my angel again by my side . \\n▁ time ebbed and flowed around me , none of it making sense and none of it mattering . \\n▁ i had a soft hand in mine and that was all i focused on . \\n▁ some part of me was conscious of moving to the nurses ' station on the first floor , where something cold and wet was placed in my free hand and a firm voice ordered me to drink it . \\n▁ i laughed at that until a sweeter voice asked me to drink it , and i complied . \\n▁ as the bland beverage hit me , my throat squeezed in sudden thirst and i finished all that was given to me in a matter of seconds . \\n▁ my body was forcefully shoved down onto a hard , flat square and another cold cup was given to me . \\n▁ i drank that one down as well . \\n▁ a male and female voice shifted away from me and i thought i heard the words ` ` call his mom '' . \\n▁ i ignored it as the warm hand in mine squeezed me tight and a head lightly rested on my shoulder . \\n▁ i relaxed back onto whatever i 'd been placed on , and rested my head on top of the one on my shoulder . \\n▁ i laughed and it felt nice , so i did it again . \\n▁ the head beneath me sighed and shifted to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … what 's wrong with you ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged , giggled and rested my forehead against hers . \\n▁ ` ` nothing … i feel great . '' \\n▁ my words still felt thick in my mouth and i laughed again and rocked my head against hers . \\n▁ ` ` what did you take ? '' \\n▁ i laughed and tried to think back to some point when i did n't feel like this - light and airy and free . \\n▁ i shrugged again . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ a sigh escaped my angel and she looked down . \\n▁ i brought my hand up to her cheek and made her eyes lift to mine , pulling back a little so i could look into them . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be sad … i feel great . '' \\n▁ i smiled widely and stroked the soft , silky skin under my thumb . \\n▁ her eyes flicked over mine . \\n▁ ` ` sure , now . \\n▁ call me tomorrow . '' \\n▁ she sighed again while i obliviously laughed . \\n▁ then she bit her lip and my eyes laser beam focused on that soft skin . \\n▁ the lips parted and words escaped them . \\n▁ ` ` i know … i know you 're wasted right now … but , did you mean it ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yes … mean what ? '' \\n▁ she sighed , the air brushing over my face smelling wonderfully of the gum she was still chewing . \\n▁ ` ` when you said you loved me ? '' \\n▁ i cocked my head and drew my eyes up to meet hers . \\n▁ ` ` of course i love you . '' \\n▁ i shrugged again , loving how wonderful those words sounded out loud . \\n▁ ` ` i love you more than anything . \\n▁ you 're my best friend . '' \\n▁ she closed her eyes when i said that . \\n▁ ` ` right … best friend . '' \\n▁ i smiled as my eyes focused back down to her soft , soft lips . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , sawyer . '' \\n▁ my head inched down to feel those lips again . \\n▁ i brushed against them and sighed , happy . \\n▁ they moved slightly , parting just a little , bringing new surfaces to feel , a new softness to explore and i sighed again , very happy . \\n▁ my hand ran along a slim neck and around behind her to string through her silky ponytail . \\n▁ so nice . \\n▁ i leaned into her more , wanting to feel more of her body , more of her skin , more of her lips . \\n▁ more … just … more . \\n▁ our lips opened wider and i flicked a quick feel for her tongue , finding it warm and receptive . \\n▁ so very nice . \\n▁ i groaned and felt for her again . \\n▁ the head turned sideways , breaking our contact . \\n▁ ` ` no , lucas … stop . '' \\n▁ i moved my lips to her soft neck , hungering for her skin . \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ it feels nice … so incredibly nice . '' \\n▁ a soft moan escaped her , doing unexpected things to my body , but she pushed me back and held my head away from her . \\n▁ ` ` nice is n't enough . '' \\n▁ i cocked my head in her hands , confused , and she sighed . \\n▁ ` ` friends do n't do this . \\n▁ we ca n't do this . '' \\n▁ her eyes turned sad as she looked over my face . \\n▁ i hated it when she looked sad . \\n▁ ` ` especially when you 're like this … '' i pulled back and looked over her expression , something starting to register with me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m making you sad ? '' \\n▁ she bit her lip and nodded , and i suddenly wanted to cry again . \\n▁ i could even feel my eyes watering . \\n▁ ` ` i only wanted you to feel nice , like me . '' \\n▁ i grabbed her face , suddenly scared . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to hurt you . \\n▁ i never want to hurt you . \\n▁ you mean everything to me . '' \\n▁ she removed my hands from her face and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc … and you mean everything to me . '' \\n▁ she ran a hand down my face . \\n▁ ` ` more than you realize . '' \\n▁ i smiled , but did n't understand . \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` let 's just sit here and wait for your mom . '' \\n▁ she curled up on my shoulder , a hand on my chest , and we waited … and waited … and waited . \\n▁ somewhere in all the waiting and water drinking -lrb- from the never ending cup that ms . reynolds never let go dry for long -rrb- , my head started clearing and i started remembering . \\n▁ i still felt light and airy , but i could think more with my head and less with … my body . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and let my head hit the wall behind me . \\n▁ the tender spot from my skull whacking was also returning , and i sucked in a quick breath . \\n▁ sawyer looked up at me from my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` oh god , sawyer … my mom 's gon na kill me . '' \\n▁ my speech was still slow , like it took a second for my brain to think it and my mouth to create it . \\n▁ i peered down at her and she grinned up at me . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i think she is . '' \\n▁ she sat up from her slumped position against me and shrugged her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` if it 's any consolation , my parents are gon na kill me too . '' \\n▁ i cocked my head , confused , and she explained . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m really late getting home . '' \\n▁ i sighed and looked down . \\n▁ suddenly , i remembered all the things i 'd done and said … to her . \\n▁ i looked back up at her , a little scared . \\n▁ ` ` hey … i ' m … i ' m really sorry about … '' she blushed and did n't let me finish . \\n▁ ` ` do n't … do n't worry about it . \\n▁ you 're just … messed up . \\n▁ happens to the best of us . '' \\n▁ i blushed and looked away , but looked back when i felt her eyes burning into me . \\n▁ ` ` do you know what … what you took ? '' \\n▁ my still sluggish brain tried to remember what happened to it . \\n▁ all i could remember was having a headache and then not having a headache . \\n▁ i scrunched my brows , trying to think harder . \\n▁ ` ` no , i just remember you handing me … '' i looked over at her , a horrid knot forming in my stomach . \\n▁ ` ` what did you give me , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ her face looked puzzled as she looked back at me . \\n▁ ` ` aspirin . \\n▁ i told you that . \\n▁ i always carry some for headaches and stuff . '' \\n▁ the knot in my stomach grew and my hazy mind tried to think rationally , and not emotionally . \\n▁ ` ` no … that was n't just aspirin . \\n▁ aspirin does n't do that to me . \\n▁ what was it ? '' \\n▁ now her brows scrunched in what looked like anger . \\n▁ ` ` it was just aspirin . '' \\n▁ she put her hand on my arm while i brought my hand to the bridge of my nose . \\n▁ my head was still so foggy … things just were n't making sense . \\n▁ ` ` look , luc , i know you 're still messed up , so i 'll try to not get angry here … but i do n't do drugs any more than you do , and i definitely did n't ` slip ' you anything . \\n▁ why would i ? '' \\n▁ i dropped my hand from my face and sighing , looked back at her . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on with me , sawyer ? \\n▁ i feel like i ' m about to start flying . '' \\n▁ i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` or falling … really , it could go either way . '' \\n▁ she patted my arm and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know , luc . \\n▁ i wish i did . '' \\n▁ i wanted to ask her more . \\n▁ i wanted to talk to her more . \\n▁ i wanted to apologize for shoving my tongue down her throat , but at that moment … my mom showed up . \\n▁ looking frazzled and panicked and wearing her hardware uniform , she flew into the nurses ' station and immediately brought her eyes to mine . \\n▁ i found i could n't meet her identical - to - mine hazel depths and stared at the floor . \\n▁ i felt sawyer clench my hand and my whole body tensed , waiting for the parental blowup that i could feel coming . \\n▁ i felt a body move in front of me and a pair of petite , black shoes filled my vision . \\n▁ i held my breath . \\n▁ then my mother squatted in front of me , placing her small hands on my knees and moving her head so she was looking up at me . \\n▁ i tentatively met her gaze , praying that my still floating brain did n't say anything stupid . \\n▁ her concerned eyes flicked between mine . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … are you okay ? '' \\n▁ i waited to hear the anger in her voice , but all i heard was concern . \\n▁ i exhaled and relaxed . \\n▁ stupidly i nodded , my vision twisting for a bit as i did . \\n▁ my mother 's entire face relaxed and with a heavy sigh she flung her arms around me and clenched me tight . \\n▁ ` ` god , you scared me . \\n▁ when they called , i thought … i thought … you scared me , luc . '' \\n▁ from somewhere in my body , guilt welled up , filling all of me , until it physically manifested as tears in my eyes that ran down my cheeks . \\n▁ i 'd hurt this small , warm woman … deeply . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , mom , '' i said brokenly , my voice struggling with the words . \\n▁ i felt like sobbing … and then i did . \\n▁ she rocked me and shushed me as her hands rubbed my back . \\n▁ i felt sawyer squeeze my hand and then release it and i slung my arms around my mom , pulling her in tight as i sobbed on her shoulder . \\n▁ i could n't understand why i was losing it … and i could n't stop it either . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , lucas … breathe … it 's okay . '' \\n▁ she kept repeating that , until eventually i stopped with the blubbering . \\n▁ my mom pulled back from me and wiped my face with her thumbs . \\n▁ i sniffled and looked over her sad features . \\n▁ i 'd done that . \\n▁ i 'd made her sad . \\n▁ i only ever made her sad . \\n▁ she looked to sawyer sitting beside me and smiled slightly at her . \\n▁ ` ` mrs . west ? '' \\n▁ my mom turned to look at ms . reynolds standing behind her . \\n▁ ` ` can i take him home ? '' \\n▁ she asked quietly . \\n▁ ms . reynolds nodded at her , flicking a quick glance at me before motioning with her thumb to an adjoining office . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i just need to speak with you privately for a moment . '' \\n▁ her expression grew tired and perhaps a bit sad and she continued slowly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , but we have strict policies on substance abuse . \\n▁ there 's going to be repercussions from this . '' \\n▁ my mom swallowed and looked down . \\n▁ she sighed heavily and nodded before standing and following ms . reynolds into a small room , where ms . reynolds closed the door behind them . \\n▁ i watched them through the glass and wondered what my fate would be . \\n▁ tiredness seeped into me and i had the strongest urge to lie down on sawyer 's lap and take a nap . \\n▁ her warm hand returned to mine and i looked over at her , blinking my eyes slowly . \\n▁ she looked over my face and wiped a stray tear away with her other hand . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay , lucas ? '' \\n▁ i smiled with one corner of my mouth . \\n▁ ` ` you ask me that a lot . '' \\n▁ she smiled in a way that matched mine and laid her head on my shoulder . \\n▁ i laid my head on hers again and closed my eyes , my light and airy feeling changing to heaviness . \\n▁ ` ` that 's because i never believe your answer . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' i muttered sleepily . \\n▁ i felt her head shift beneath me and lifted mine up , resting it gently against the wall behind me , my eyes still closed . \\n▁ ` ` what do you think they 'll do to you ? '' \\n▁ she asked , and i pried my eyes open to look at my mom talking to ms . reynolds , who was lightly shaking her head , looking apologetic . \\n▁ ` ` kick me out ? '' \\n▁ i said quietly . \\n▁ ` ` no , they would n't … would they ? '' \\n▁ i slowly swung my head around at hearing the genuine concern in her voice . \\n▁ i shrugged my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m on campus … fucked up . '' \\n▁ i shrugged again . \\n▁ ` ` they 're gon na toss me . '' \\n▁ i looked back to the windows where ms . reynolds was saying something to my mom , who was now holding a hand over her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` they hate me anyway , '' i muttered . \\n▁ sawyer squeezed my hand , but i did n't look back at her . \\n▁ guilt filled me again as i watched my mom hopelessly try and fight for me . \\n▁ ` ` they do n't , lucas , '' sawyer quietly said beside me . \\n▁ i finally did look back at her . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ my tongue felt solid in my mouth and my eyes wanted to close again . \\n▁ she sighed and shook her head , her dark hair swishing over my jacket . \\n▁ ` ` they do n't hate you … not all of them anyway . \\n▁ some are just confused . \\n▁ you do n't remember the accident … and there are so many rumors about it . '' \\n▁ she shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` they just do n't know what to believe . '' \\n▁ anger shot through me , and i turned my head straight and did n't look at her . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't drinking … they could believe that . '' \\n▁ she sighed and rested her head on my shoulder again . \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc … i know . '' \\n▁ we stayed that way until my mom and ms . reynolds returned from the small room ; both women looking sad and worn out . \\n▁ ms . reynolds clasped her hands in front of her and clearing her throat , spoke to me in her most professional voice . \\n▁ ` ` lucas , we do n't know what you took , but it 's obvious you took something . \\n▁ i ' ve spoken with the principal and you are hereby suspended from school for two weeks . \\n▁ you wo n't be allowed on or near the campus until your suspension is over , but if sawyer wishes , she may gather your schoolwork so you do n't fall behind . \\n▁ we have no desire to have your good grades suffer , and even though you will now have this on your permanent record … i believe you 're a good enough student to not have that affect you too much when you apply for colleges later this year . '' \\n▁ she smiled warmly , like everything was just fine . \\n▁ my mom sighed softly beside her . \\n▁ my tired mind tried to process the long stream of words , but i sort of got stuck on the first part . \\n▁ i scrunched my brow , not really understanding . \\n▁ ` ` you 're … giving me a vacation ? '' \\n▁ i heard sawyer beside me snicker for just a fraction of a second before she shifted it to a cough . \\n▁ ms . reynolds drew her brows down to an almost imposing looking point . \\n▁ ` ` no … it 's a punishment , lucas . \\n▁ time for you to think about what you ' ve done … whatever that may be . '' \\n▁ her face relaxed and she looked at me pointedly . \\n▁ ` ` it also brings you that much closer to our two strikes out rule . \\n▁ one more infraction like this , luc … and you 'll be gone . '' \\n▁ i swallowed as that thought actually did sink in . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't do this , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ms . reynolds gave me a small smile , that clearly showed she completely did n't believe me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't let it happen again , luc . '' \\n▁ she looked down for a moment and with a small sigh looked back up . \\n▁ ` ` we also … '' she sighed heavily and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , luc , but the principal thinks you being in the safe and sound club is setting a bad example . \\n▁ i ' m sorry … but you 're out . '' \\n▁ that actually shocked me more than the vacation i was being given . \\n▁ i stood up . \\n▁ well , i tried to . \\n▁ it took a couple times before i completely did it . \\n▁ sawyer stood up with me , supporting me with a hand on my chest . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ no … '' that was my free time with sawyer , if they took that away from me , i 'd be spending that time alone in my house … with thoughts i did n't need to be thinking anymore than i already did . \\n▁ i wanted sawyer , i wanted her peace . \\n▁ ` ` please ? '' \\n▁ ms . reynolds gave me a sympathetic look at the pleading in my voice . \\n▁ i glanced at my mother and she looked surprised . \\n▁ i had n't told her about the club , and my obvious desire to stay in it was taking her back . \\n▁ i looked back to ms . reynolds with eyes that i hoped matched my voice . \\n▁ they could n't take this from me too … she bit her lip and then sighed again . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll talk to the principal again , luc . \\n▁ maybe … '' she put a hand on her chin and then her face brightened . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll ask her about you seeing the counselor . \\n▁ maybe if you complete a session with her , she 'll consider letting you rejoin our group . '' \\n▁ her face brightened more as my mouth dropped . \\n▁ my addled brain stuck on the word ` ` counselor '' . \\n▁ i did n't want a counselor … but i did want sawyer . \\n▁ i looked back at her and she smiled at me encouragingly . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , okay . '' \\n▁ i found myself saying the words without even meaning to say them . \\n▁ ms . reynolds made a pleased noise and even my mom seemed to sigh in relief . \\n▁ ms . reynolds walked over to me and put a hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m really glad this club has come to mean so much to you , lucas . '' \\n▁ her eyes took on an impassioned glow . \\n▁ ` ` i know we can help you . '' \\n▁ internally , i sighed . \\n▁ externally , i smiled slightly and nodded . \\n▁ i wanted to leave . \\n▁ i wanted to forget this day ever happened . \\n▁ i wanted to finally nap . \\n▁ with a swift goodbye hug from ms . reynolds and a great deal of help with my sluggish body from sawyer -lrb- mr . varner had apparently took off on me the minute after he 'd called my mom -rrb- , i was finally in my mother 's car and waving to sawyer through the glass while she bit her lip and watched me pull away . \\n▁ after a quick and thankfully silent ride home , i was helped into bed , also silently , and gratefully fell asleep … letting my nightmare of a day seep off of me . \\n▁ i 'd been asleep for mere seconds it seemed when a loud voice across my room woke me up . \\n▁ ` ` so , what the hell was that , luc ? \\n▁ you were wasted at school … you ? '' \\n▁ i cracked my eyes open and saw darren on the far side of my bedroom twirling one of my footballs in his hand . \\n▁ instantly , i knew that i 'd never woken up , and one of my dead friends had decided to make an appearance in my drug - induced sleep . \\n▁ i was n't in the mood for it at the moment . \\n▁ ` ` go away … my head still hurts . '' \\n▁ i threw the sheets up over my aching skull and tried to ignore his loud chuckles . \\n▁ ` ` go away ? \\n▁ i finally got my shot at some screen time . '' \\n▁ i pulled back my covers to glare at him . \\n▁ he smirked at my not amused face . \\n▁ ` ` lil 's been hogging it all . '' \\n▁ his grin turned devilish as he approached the bed . \\n▁ ` ` of course , she can entertain you in ways i ca n't . '' \\n▁ tossing the football in the air , he groaned indecently as he sat on the edge of the bed . \\n▁ ` ` nice job on that midnight rendezvous by the way … that was awesome . '' \\n▁ i blushed and then rolled my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i know you 're just a dream , but quit poking around in my other dreams . '' \\n▁ he laughed as he tossed the football a few more times . \\n▁ ` ` but those are the interesting ones . '' \\n▁ he caught the ball and abruptly threw it at my chest . \\n▁ luckily , i managed to catch it in time . \\n▁ ` ` besides , '' he pointed at his own head , ` ` i ' m you … it 's not like i can keep you out of your own head . '' \\n▁ i gave him a blank look as i tried to absorb that , and he laughed again . \\n▁ he lay back on the bed as i sat up , tossing the football to the ground and running a hand through my hair . \\n▁ ` ` anyway , happy endings are the best , '' he muttered as he looked over at me pointedly . \\n▁ ` ` right ? '' \\n▁ i blushed again . \\n▁ ` ` are you done ? '' \\n▁ he laughed and sat up . \\n▁ ` ` yeah … i guess . '' \\n▁ he frowned as a sudden thought struck him . \\n▁ ` ` hey … you better not ever invite sammy to your little xxunk . \\n▁ i 'll kick your ass . '' \\n▁ i shook my head at him and then laughed at the absurdity of all of it . \\n▁ he eventually laughed with me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's good to see you , man . \\n▁ i ' ve missed you . '' \\n▁ darren got a sappy look on his face . \\n▁ ` ` ah , do we get to hug now ? '' \\n▁ i laughed and tossed my pillow at him . \\n▁ he laughed as he effortlessly caught it . \\n▁ i shook my head again , which suddenly felt fine , and his face tightened into seriousness . \\n▁ ` ` seriously , what was that , man ? \\n▁ at school ? \\n▁ what happened ? '' \\n▁ my face got serious too as i looked over his darkening eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ he sniffed and cocked his head . \\n▁ ` ` you need to figure it out , luc . \\n▁ you did n't do it , so someone dosed you … and if it happens again … '' he shrugged and i sighed and ran a hand down my face . \\n▁ ` ` i know … i ' m screwed . '' \\n▁ he laughed and i peeked at him from under my fingers . \\n▁ ` ` god , lucas … what you said to ms . reynolds . \\n▁ damn , that was hot ! '' \\n▁ he laughed harder . \\n▁ ` ` i wish i 'd had the guts to tell her that . '' \\n▁ i sighed heavily and laid my head back on the wall . \\n▁ ` ` crap … i 'd forgotten about that . \\n▁ everyone heard me say it too . '' \\n▁ darren laughed some more and i lifted my head to glare at him . \\n▁ ` ` it 's really not that funny . '' \\n▁ he cocked his head at me again , still chuckling . \\n▁ ` ` really ? \\n▁ if i was the one that told her she was ` totally xxunk ' you would n't be laughing your ass off right now ? '' \\n▁ i tried to glare , but broke out into laughter instead . \\n▁ he had a point . \\n▁ if anyone but me had said it , i 'd be rolling on the floor . \\n▁ as my laughs subsided , i tossed the covers off of me , looking over my fully dressed self with an amused shake of my head , and placed my feet on the floor , sitting on the edge of the bed with darren . \\n▁ his laughs died down too as he looked over at me , his elbows on his knees . \\n▁ i stared at the shoes on my feet . \\n▁ ` ` they 're gon na make me see a counselor , '' i muttered sullenly . \\n▁ ` ` good , '' darren responded immediately beside me . \\n▁ i looked over at him and he shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` you should talk to someone , luc , after what you went through . '' \\n▁ i started to shake my head and object when he cut me off , ` ` and no , talking to figments of your imagination does n't count . '' \\n▁ he rolled his eyes and i looked back at my shoes . \\n▁ ` ` you guys are the only ones i want to talk to . \\n▁ you 're the only ones that matter . '' \\n▁ my tone was soft , but firm . \\n▁ he sighed and then chuckled and i looked over at him again . \\n▁ ` ` what about that hot , fiery girl … sawyer ? '' \\n▁ i grinned but then stopped and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` no , i do n't need to bring her into my drama … more than i already do . '' \\n▁ i exhaled loudly and slumped my head into my hands . \\n▁ ` ` god , i totally kissed her . \\n▁ i ' m not sure if she likes me like that but … '' ` ` did she kiss you back , '' darren said simply . \\n▁ i peered up at him , my hands still tangled in my hair . \\n▁ ` ` yeah … from what i can remember . '' \\n▁ he smiled crookedly at me . \\n▁ ` ` well , then , yeah … she likes you . '' \\n▁ i sighed and looked back at the floor . \\n▁ ` ` great … now i ' m going to have to hurt her . \\n▁ i wish that had n't happened . '' \\n▁ i sighed again . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ darren stood and walked over to a mirror on the wall . \\n▁ on the inside edge , a picture of the four of us was tucked under the frame and he pulled it out to look at it . \\n▁ ` ` she 's pretty and interesting and you guys seem like you like each other . \\n▁ why not go for it ? '' \\n▁ he looked back over to me , my eyes straying to the photo as his left it . \\n▁ ` ` because i ' m with lil , '' i answered automatically . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i looked from the photo to his face . \\n▁ his brown eyes were narrowed at me and his perpetually sticking up hair almost seemed to emphasize his questioning look . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m with - '' he interrupted me , ` ` no , i heard you … i just do n't get it . '' \\n▁ with the picture still in hand he walked over to stand beside me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're turning down a living girl who clearly adores you , '' he pointed to lil in the photo , her thin arms encircling my neck , ` ` for a dead girl , that you only get to be with … in your dreams ? '' \\n▁ i swallowed the painful lump in my throat at the happy memory that photo was invoking in me . \\n▁ my mom had taken it on some random saturday afternoon here at the house . \\n▁ there was nothing special about the day , it was just a saturday , a saturday we 'd all spent together , a saturday we 'd thought we 'd get hundreds more of . \\n▁ they 'd died three weeks after that photo was taken . \\n▁ ` ` it feels real darren . \\n▁ this feels real . '' \\n▁ he tossed the photo at me , it flying into my chest before fluttering to the ground at my feet . \\n▁ i picked it up as he made an annoyed sound . \\n▁ my fingers traced the sharp edge of the picture before trailing down lil 's face . \\n▁ in the picture , darren was standing behind a brilliantly smiling sammy , his arms around her trim waist , his head resting against her neck . \\n▁ lillian and i were standing next to them , my arms around her waist , her head tilted slightly to look up at me . \\n▁ she was so beautiful . \\n▁ for just a moment , i wondered if i could control my dream enough to bring her to me . \\n▁ i wanted to concentrate on it , but darren snatched the photo from me and my train of thought vanished . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a touch crazy , luc , '' he muttered , still shaking his head . \\n▁ i stood up and grabbing the picture from him , returned it to its spot on the mirror . \\n▁ pressing it flat against the cool , reflective surface , i muttered , ` ` yeah … maybe . \\n▁ killing your friends will do that to you . '' \\n▁ a long sigh answered me and as my gaze shifted behind me in the mirror , i saw darren 's face soften in sympathy . \\n▁ he walked over and placed a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ he was about to speak , when suddenly , sammy stepped out from behind him . \\n▁ i smiled as i met eyes with her in the mirror . \\n▁ hers were a warm , beautiful golden - brown and her smile was soft and friendly as she walked up to darren and grabbed his free hand . \\n▁ ` ` hi , lucas , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i turned to look at her , her auburn hair shining in the dim light of my room . \\n▁ ` ` hey , sammy … it 's good to see you . '' \\n▁ she nodded and bit her lip . \\n▁ she looked over at darren and he looked back at her . \\n▁ the love that passed between them in that gaze hit me like a wrecking ball in the center of my chest , and for a moment , i wanted to sob for taking that love from this earth . \\n▁ i swallowed back the pain and watched my soul - mated friends . \\n▁ ` ` it 's time to go , darren , '' sammy said softly , her other hand going to his cheek . \\n▁ he nodded to her and looked back at me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll see you around , luc … and be careful . \\n▁ someone has it out for you . '' \\n▁ i smirked at him . \\n▁ ` ` who does n't , darren ? '' \\n▁ he frowned at me and looked about to argue , when i suddenly woke up . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; as if her words had reminded me of my body 's situation , i took a long drink of my water . \\n▁ her eyes watched my every move as i tilted it back , taking as much as i could . \\n▁ the cool liquid relieving my ache reminded me of my revelation in the bathroom . \\n▁ as i removed the glass from my lips and set it on the coffee table , i sighed softly . \\n▁ ` ` i know what happened to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ she immediately asked . \\n▁ i looked over at her and her long , dark hair flowing over her shoulders . \\n▁ i had a strong desire to tuck a strand behind her ear , but i locked my hands together and leaned over my knees , resisting that urge . \\n▁ i did n't want to mislead her … anymore than i knew i already had . \\n▁ ` ` josh , '' i said simply . \\n▁ when her eyes looked bewildered , i filled in what little detail i could . \\n▁ ` ` he had randy dose my water bottle with … something , while he was busy tackling me in astronomy . \\n▁ when i drank it later with your aspirin , i took whatever drug he slipped me . \\n▁ acid , ecstasy , speed … something like that . '' \\n▁ her eyes widened while she thought about that . \\n▁ she moved closer to me on the couch . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ why would he do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think … '' i looked over her features before i continued , ` ` i think he wants to get me kicked out of school . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` if he gets me kicked out … well , my chances of getting out of here would greatly dwindle . '' \\n▁ i smiled halfheartedly . \\n▁ ` ` he either really wants me to hang around … or he wants to ruin me . '' \\n▁ i shook my head and stared over at the innocent looking show on tv . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m guessing the latter . '' \\n▁ sawyer 's hand came up to rest on my knee and i looked down at it and then over to her . \\n▁ feeling an emptiness starting to overwhelm me , i leaned back on the couch and put my arms around her shoulders , drawing her in for a tight , side - by - side hug . \\n▁ her arms slung around me , her hands pressing into my back , and she softly exhaled . \\n▁ i swallowed back the sudden emotion … and the guilt that i could never keep our relationship on a not - physical level for very long . \\n▁ i could n't help it . \\n▁ i needed her so much . \\n▁ i dropped my head into the crook of her neck and exhaled a stuttered breath that sounded on the verge of tears . \\n▁ i hoped that was n't where my body was going . \\n▁ i really did n't need to cry anymore around sawyer … she 'd seen quite enough of that . \\n▁ she started rubbing my back and whispering soothing words in my ear . \\n▁ i relaxed under her hands and felt that familiar peace wash over me . \\n▁ i pulled back slightly and turned my head so we were just inches apart . \\n▁ her lips parted as she breathed softly on me . \\n▁ i recalled my dream with darren , him wanting me to go forward with sawyer and leave lil behind . \\n▁ i glanced down at sawyer 's lips , so close to mine , the sun sparkling off them invitingly . \\n▁ i remembered the soft warmth of them yesterday , the soft sound she 'd made when i 'd touched her like that . \\n▁ her breath stopped as i stared down at the form of those shapely lips . \\n▁ beautiful lips , really . \\n▁ but different than lil 's … different than what i wanted . \\n▁ i still wanted to be with lillian , and i could n't keep playing with sawyer 's head . \\n▁ that was n't fair . \\n▁ those lips started coming towards me and i instinctually pulled back . \\n▁ i glanced up at sawyer 's eyes and immediately saw hurt and rejection there . \\n▁ she started to turn her head away from me and dropped her arms from my back . \\n▁ my hand went to her cheek and turned her back to me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're my only friend , sawyer . \\n▁ i ' m so sorry about what happened yesterday . '' \\n▁ i held her face gently , making sure she kept eye contact with me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry if i hurt you … or misled you . '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked between hers as she flicked between mine . \\n▁ ` ` you 're my best friend . \\n▁ i do n't ever want to lose you … but that 's all i can be right now . '' \\n▁ her eyes glassed over , but she nodded and removed my hand from her cheek . \\n▁ she held it in her lap . \\n▁ ` ` i know , lucas . \\n▁ i understand … about yesterday . \\n▁ i ' m not angry … or misled . '' \\n▁ since i felt like we 'd just almost had another inappropriate moment , i wanted to say more , say something , but she switched topics on me , effectively closing that door , for now . \\n▁ ` ` what are you going to do about josh ? '' \\n▁ i relaxed back into the couch , dropping my head back on the cushion and staring up at the ceiling . \\n▁ her hand still holding mine , laced our fingers together . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and sighed softly . \\n▁ ` ` i have no idea … '' i turned my head and opened my eyes to look at her . \\n▁ ` ` suggestions ? '' \\n▁ she smiled and brought her legs up underneath her , shifting to face me on the couch . \\n▁ ` ` kick his ass so hard that he 'd be too afraid to try anything else ? '' \\n▁ she laughed softly and i joined her . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i could always try that … '' she stopped laughing and a seriousness blanketed the couch . \\n▁ ` ` luc … you should tell one of the teachers . \\n▁ ms . reynolds maybe ? \\n▁ tell her that he drugged you . '' \\n▁ her other hand closed over our still laced together fingers and she gently squeezed . \\n▁ i looked at our hands for a moment and then i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ you know how they see me . \\n▁ they would n't believe me . \\n▁ even ms . reynolds would n't believe me . \\n▁ no one believes me . '' \\n▁ i whispered that last part . \\n▁ she sighed and shifted her body to rest her head on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i believe you , luc . '' \\n▁ i pressed my lips into her hair . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i breathed . \\n▁ she stayed with me for awhile on the couch , holding my hand and watching that mindless show on tv with me . \\n▁ i relaxed back on the cushions , careful to not move too much as my head cleared , and continually drinking from my super large glass of water . \\n▁ sawyer rested her head against my shoulder and a comfortable silence fell between us . \\n▁ i watched her from the corner of my eye while we rested together . \\n▁ she 'd occasionally adjust her head against me , her dark hair flowing down my arm as she snuggled closer into my side . \\n▁ her fingers against mine were warm and dry , comfortable . \\n▁ her other hand played with a frayed patch of denim on her often worn pair of jeans and her toes , just showing from underneath where she 'd tucked them under herself , unconsciously drew patterns in the couch . \\n▁ she seemed completely comfortable and relaxed here with me , and i relaxed in kind , happy that i had n't messed things up too much with my impaired mind yesterday . \\n▁ she noticed me seemingly checking her out and pulled back to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ she asked as she looked over herself quickly . \\n▁ i smiled at her reaction and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ i was just watching you . '' \\n▁ she looked back at me with an odd , almost appraising look and i quickly covered my , once again , could be misleading statement . \\n▁ ` ` this is nice . \\n▁ why have n't you wanted to hang out with me here , before today ? '' \\n▁ i cocked my head as i watched her reaction . \\n▁ she pulled back from my shoulder and bit her lip . \\n▁ ` ` i have wanted to … it 's just … '' ` ` my mom ? '' \\n▁ i asked , as i shifted slightly to better face her . \\n▁ she shifted as well and tucked her long hair behind her ears . \\n▁ ` ` no … not really . '' \\n▁ she looked down and sighed , and for a moment , i thought she was n't going to explain it to me . \\n▁ that would be fine ; i still would n't press her for details she did n't want to give . \\n▁ just when i was about to pull her back into my shoulder , so we could keep watching tv , she looked up and answered me . \\n▁ ` ` i did something really stupid with an even stupider guy , and i ' m trying … '' she looked away from me , ` ` i ' m trying to be smarter . '' \\n▁ she looked back at me and frowned . \\n▁ ` ` sometimes , i do n't feel like i succeed at that . '' \\n▁ i frowned , my mind suddenly full of questions . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't … you did n't want to be here with me , because you thought … '' i was n't sure where to go with that and i let my sentence trail off . \\n▁ she looked over my confused face and sighed . \\n▁ ` ` i always wanted to come in , luc , really , i did … i do . \\n▁ i just did n't want to get too fond of you , '' she looked down and picked at a strand of fabric on her knee , ` ` if this was n't going to last . '' \\n▁ ` ` hey … sawyer … '' my hand started to reach up for her cheek but she looked up at it and i paused in my reach while she stared at my hand . \\n▁ i dropped it when she looked up and met my gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i know you 're hurting , and you need someone around , luc . '' \\n▁ she shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i just was n't sure if that would always be me . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , not even able to comprehend that . \\n▁ why would n't i want her around ? \\n▁ i always wanted her around . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer , you mean every … '' i could n't finish my emotional thought and let it die between us . \\n▁ she cocked her head as she watched me struggle to find something compelling to say to her . \\n▁ ` ` besides , my dad really would n't let me come over . \\n▁ they would n't even like me being here now , on the weekend . '' \\n▁ she shrugged , like she was just used to how protective they were . \\n▁ a bit of the tension that had been building in the room faded away , and i let my more emotional thoughts drift off with it . \\n▁ embracing the semi - playful look on her face i said , ` ` why are your parents so strict with you ? '' \\n▁ i raised an eyebrow mischievously . \\n▁ ` ` besides hanging out with me , you seem to have good judgment . '' \\n▁ she laughed a bit at my statement and leaned into me . \\n▁ ` ` well , remember the stupid thing i did ? '' \\n▁ i frowned as i thought back to her earlier comment . \\n▁ ` ` with the stupid boy ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yeah … '' then she frowned and a deep sadness marked her features . \\n▁ ` ` they moved me out here because of what i did . \\n▁ they both gave up a lot to do that , and we did n't have a whole lot to begin with . '' \\n▁ she ran a finger over her holey jeans and sighed . \\n▁ ` ` i messed up a lot for them , and i just … i do n't push it . '' \\n▁ she looked up at me and sighed while i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` i deserve their xxunk . '' \\n▁ without meaning to , i muttered , ` ` what did you do , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ she bit her lip and shook her head , obviously not wanting to talk about it . \\n▁ ` ` i made a mistake , '' she finally whispered . \\n▁ she raised her eyebrows at the end of her sentence like i should understand that . \\n▁ and i did . \\n▁ if anyone understood mistakes … it was me . \\n▁ as her eyes started to water , i dropped the conversation and pulled her tight to me . \\n▁ i felt her silently cry against my shoulder and cradled her head with one of my hands while the other clutched her back firmly , pulling her even closer . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , sawyer … i understand . '' \\n▁ i did n't understand the details , but i understood the emotion . \\n▁ whatever she 'd done , had uprooted her family and put her under near house arrest . \\n▁ whatever she 'd done , hurt her and continued to hurt her . \\n▁ whatever she 'd done , made her feel out - casted from the rest of our school . \\n▁ and whatever she 'd done , had probably been a huge reason why she and i had bonded so quickly . \\n▁ she really did understand my pain and loneliness . \\n▁ she 'd felt her own version of it . \\n▁ i held her a bit longer and then wiping her eyes , she pulled away from me , saying her parents would be home soon and she needed to go . \\n▁ i nodded and walked with her to the door , handing her my letterman 's jacket before she opened it . \\n▁ she smiled as she slipped it on and i smiled watching her . \\n▁ i did n't know all of her story , just like she did n't know all of mine , but we needed each other anyway , and i liked that it was a mutual feeling . \\n▁ i waved at her as i watched her drive away , then i sat back down on the couch and avoided moving and avoided thinking . \\n▁ i sort of managed both . \\n▁ the rest of my afternoon was dull and unproductive . \\n▁ well , i suppose i did eventually fix the cracked wall in the bathroom . \\n▁ i did n't get around to it until after my mom came home , but she did n't say anything about it if she saw it . \\n▁ she did n't say much of anything , really . \\n▁ just that she loved me and if i ever wanted to talk to her about anything , she was here for me . \\n▁ i took that to heart , but still decided to keep my demons to myself . \\n▁ she did n't need to know the things i knew . \\n▁ she did n't need my memories haunting her , like they haunted me . \\n▁ i smiled , and remaining silent on all of the painful subjects that swirled around in my head , kissed hers , while we set about making a more substantial dinner than my usual hot pockets . \\n▁ she talked about some of her nicer customers while we ate our meal . \\n▁ she always only mentioned the nice ones to me , both at the diner and the hardware store . \\n▁ she usually held back anything painful , and a split second after i wished she 'd open up to me , i realized just how alike we were . \\n▁ i did n't ask her to spill her secrets , and let her keep her own demons , just like she usually let me keep mine . \\n▁ between a forkful of food , she casually tossed out , ` ` i saw the sheriff today at the diner . \\n▁ he says hello . '' \\n▁ i smiled softly and nodded , resuming my eating while i thought about that . \\n▁ sheriff whitney had been the first one to find me that night . \\n▁ i do n't know how long i 'd lain in that ravine , in and out of consciousness , but his voice calling down to me had been as miraculous to me as the fact that i 'd managed to live through that ordeal with only a few scrapes and bruises . \\n▁ he 'd scrambled down to me , immediately prying open my door and checking my pulse . \\n▁ i 'd weakly looked over at him , at his silver hair and silver - blue eyes . \\n▁ he 'd looked almost unreal to me at first . \\n▁ of course , my vision had been swimming in and out as icy shock had flooded through me . \\n▁ but i 'd still taken in the tan , crisp uniform , splotched with mud , his knees even saturated with it , like he 'd fallen a few times on the way down to me , and the impressive black belt , holding his cuffs and gun . \\n▁ as i 'd stared at the silver cuffs , i 'd wondered if he 'd use them on me when he shoved me in the back seat of his car , for surely , he 'd arrest me . \\n▁ lil 's beer had spilled all over the seat , soaking my jeans , and i knew i reeked of it . \\n▁ but he had n't . \\n▁ his face softened with sympathy as he checked my vitals . \\n▁ then he 'd told me , ` ` everything will be alright , lucas . \\n▁ i 'll take care of you . '' \\n▁ i 'd had no idea what that meant at the time , and honestly , i still did n't , but he 'd moved away from me then , checking on my friends while calling for help again on his radio clipped to his shoulder . \\n▁ i 'd closed my eyes so i was n't tempted to watch him examine lil . \\n▁ i 'd already seen her . \\n▁ i 'd already shed tears for her , a lot of tears . \\n▁ i did n't want to do it again . \\n▁ the shock kept me in a sort of frozen numbness as i waited for the ambulance to get me out of there . \\n▁ with sheriff whitney 's help , the paramedics managed to get me back up the steep hill in some sort of odd stretcher thing . \\n▁ as they were about to close the doors behind me , i looked back at the sheriff watching me with an intensely sad expression . \\n▁ ` ` my friends ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ he closed his eyes briefly and then shook his head at me . \\n▁ that 's when the numbness of my shock induced state wore off . \\n▁ that 's when i 'd started sobbing . \\n▁ i think i sobbed all the way to the hospital . \\n▁ i sighed as i peeked up at my mom . \\n▁ she had a soft smile on her lips as she ate her dinner . \\n▁ i suppose to her , the sheriff was a happy memory , he did sort of save my life , after all . \\n▁ i picked at the food on my plate while i thought about the next time i saw him … later at the hospital . \\n▁ i do n't know how long i 'd been there , but i 'd been tested and scanned , poked and prodded . \\n▁ an iv of some fluid was dripping into me , and i could barely keep my eyes open as i 'd laid in my sterile bed , while my mom sat beside me in a chair , holding my hand , eyes red and bloodshot from crying . \\n▁ i 'd lethargically looked over at him as he 'd entered the room , still looking muddy and disheveled . \\n▁ he 'd met eyes with my mom and walked over to gently put a hand on her shoulder . \\n▁ looking back up at me , he exhaled softly , his eyes overly moist . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , lucas . \\n▁ we tried … miss tate was already gone . '' \\n▁ he looked down while i swallowed back more tears . \\n▁ tate … that was lillian 's last name . \\n▁ he looked back up again and continued in a thick voice . \\n▁ ` ` we found mr . mccord and miss carter not far from the wreck … they were both unconscious , barely alive . '' \\n▁ a surge of painful hope went straight through me - darren and sammy were alive . \\n▁ my mouth dropped open to ask where they were , how they were , if i could see them , but his face shut off my questions . \\n▁ he had fallen into despondency and my mother beside me gave a soft sob . \\n▁ i shook my head while he gave me news i did n't want to hear . \\n▁ ` ` miss carter … died , shortly after we found her . \\n▁ there just was n't anything we could do for her . '' \\n▁ a tear leaked down my cheek … not sammy . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and prayed that he 'd tell me darren made it , that i was n't alone , that i had n't killed them all . \\n▁ please do n't take them all . \\n▁ a soft exhale met me and my entire body tightened in anticipation . \\n▁ ` ` mr . mccord … had several internal injuries . \\n▁ we thought he might still … '' i peeked my eyes open , my body shaking with tension . \\n▁ sheriff whitney 's face looked worn and haggard when he met my gaze . \\n▁ ` ` he died in the ambulance , lucas . \\n▁ i ' m so sorry … they 're all gone . '' \\n▁ i shut off my memory of breaking down into near hysterics after hearing the fate of my friends . \\n▁ even so , flashes of screaming , crying , yelling and trying to damage anything around me , filled my head . \\n▁ i 'd been so wild with grief , that the sheriff had had to restrain me , pinning my arms down on the bed . \\n▁ i 'd had no control over myself … but , how often do you hear that three of the people you love most in the world are gone ? \\n▁ hopefully , not very often . \\n▁ i looked away from my mom 's soft smile and pushed my half eaten plate from me . \\n▁ i could n't finish it now ; my appetite had vanished with that last memory . \\n▁ softly , i excused myself and stood from the table . \\n▁ mom looked over my face , concerned , and asked if i was alright . \\n▁ i lied and told her i was , that i was just full , and then slipped on my jacket and walked out the back door . \\n▁ i sat on the back step and stared at a football in the yard . \\n▁ it was the ball from my dream with darren . \\n▁ in reality , it had been out here . \\n▁ i picked it up and gripped it in my hands , relishing the familiar feel of it - the ridges under my fingertips , lining up automatically in the correct spot , the bumpy texture of it , sending more pleasant memories my way . \\n▁ i flexed my arm and faked a pass , keeping the ball in my hand , but allowing my body to remember the instinct of throwing . \\n▁ it relaxed me and i did it a few more times . \\n▁ sheriff whitney . \\n▁ i wished mom had n't brought him up . \\n▁ it was n't his fault that i associated him with something so horrid , but i did . \\n▁ he was actually a very nice man and was one of the small handful in this town that believed me . \\n▁ of course , he was a man of facts , and my blood had tested clean so - boom - innocent . \\n▁ if only everyone else could be so easily convinced . \\n▁ he 'd visited a few times over the summer , mainly talking with my mother in the living room while i was curled up in a fetal position on my bed . \\n▁ but he did stop in and tell me everything would be fine , and eventually everything would get better . \\n▁ he always put a reassuring hand on my shoulder and spoke in that soft voice reserved for those on the verge of an emotional collapse , which , i suppose i had been . \\n▁ maybe i still was . \\n▁ i tossed the ball in the air a few times and nimbly caught it . \\n▁ sheriff had n't charged me with anything . \\n▁ not manslaughter , not reckless driving , not an xxunk … not even a speeding ticket . \\n▁ the town and even some of the deceased 's families -lrb- josh in particular -rrb- , had been in an uproar about that . \\n▁ they all felt i was guilty , and had basically gotten away with murder . \\n▁ the general consensus from the town for me being let go , without even a wrist slap , was my mother . \\n▁ most people felt that i was n't being charged because the town liked her , had a soft spot for her even . \\n▁ people sympathized with her situation and did n't want her to be punished any farther , for her reckless son 's , reckless behavior . \\n▁ i do n't know if that was true or not . \\n▁ i did n't know the legal system well enough to know what the sheriff could have charged me with anyway . \\n▁ all i knew for sure , was that i was n't being ` ` legally '' punished , and i did feel horribly guilty about that . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i grew to relish my time spent dreaming , and dreaded my time spent awake , so much so , that i 'd started searching for ways to prolong slumber . \\n▁ i napped as often as i could throughout the day , and when that started to not work anymore , i 'd scrounged through my mother 's medicine cabinet until i found her stash of xxunk , the stash she did n't know i was aware of . \\n▁ i 'd started popping them like candy , wanting to zone out and be with my friends , even if it was all in my head . \\n▁ i knew it was a bad habit to start , and i was never one to pop prescriptions before , but i wanted to see them , and it actually did help . \\n▁ i 'd just taken two when sawyer unexpectedly showed up . \\n▁ from what i could remember of the passing days , it was thursday afternoon when a light knock filtered through my door . \\n▁ just starting to feel the sleepy side effects of the drugs i 'd taken , i shuffled to the door , not really caring who was at it . \\n▁ still in my lounge pants -lrb- that i 'd kind of been living in -rrb- , i squinted a bit as the bright light of day hit me . \\n▁ my starting to lull mind startled into semi - awareness at seeing sawyer and her super dark hair standing before me . \\n▁ ` ` hey … hi , '' i mumbled when her face filled my vision . \\n▁ i leaned against the doorframe and blinked away the sleepiness trying to settle on me . \\n▁ ` ` hey , '' she answered back , as her eyes flicked over my face . \\n▁ her pale , gray eyes narrowed with concern while her lips curved down into an adorable pout . \\n▁ ` ` you look awful , are you okay ? '' \\n▁ i smiled and a sleepy laugh escaped me at the familiar phrase passing her lips . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine … just resting . \\n▁ come on in . '' \\n▁ i stepped back and swung my arm out to indicate the room behind me . \\n▁ still frowning at me , she walked past . \\n▁ i ran a hand through my bed - head , messy hair and then down my scraggly face , realizing i had n't shaved in awhile and … actually , i had n't showered in a while either and i probably did look -lrb- and smell -rrb- a mess . \\n▁ i considered popping in the shower real quick while sawyer looked around my living room , but discarded it when she sat on my couch and looked back at me still in the doorway . \\n▁ i had n't seen her in so long ; i did n't want to miss a minute . \\n▁ i shook my head to clear the cobwebs and softly closed the front door before joining her on the couch . \\n▁ i wanted to throw my arms around her and squeeze her tight , but i did n't . \\n▁ and not just because i did n't want to be misleading anymore … i also did n't want to offend her with my , i ' m sure , rank scent . \\n▁ she put her school bag on the ground before us and opened it . \\n▁ she began rummaging around inside it as that splendid voice that i 'd missed so much spoke softly to me . \\n▁ ` ` sorry i ' m so late in getting you your stuff . '' \\n▁ she sighed irritably while my slow mind tried to understand what she was talking about . \\n▁ ` ` my parents had issues with me coming over here . '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i told them it was just to give you your homework , but they still flipped out . '' \\n▁ she grabbed a folder and some papers she 'd found and handed them to me . \\n▁ my mind put the pieces together after she said ` ` homework '' and i smiled softly as i took the stack she had for me . \\n▁ i 'd forgotten that she was going to do that for me . \\n▁ she sighed again and met my eye , just as i was about to thank her . \\n▁ ` ` ms . reynolds eventually had to call them and explain the situation . '' \\n▁ she rolled her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` she actually had to ask them to let me help you . \\n▁ i think she was going to come over here herself if they refused again . \\n▁ luckily they did n't , and i have exactly twenty minutes after purity club to get you caught up each day . '' \\n▁ my slow smile stretched wider at hearing her story . \\n▁ i 'd missed her so much and she 'd been out there fighting for me . \\n▁ she was shaking her head at her parents ' over protectiveness when she narrowed her eyes again and searched my slowly blinking ones . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure you 're okay ? \\n▁ you seem … out of it . '' \\n▁ i rubbed my eyes to try and keep myself awake , to enjoy my twenty minutes , if that was all i got , and exhaled softly . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i just took a couple of my mom 's sleeping pills before you got here . \\n▁ they 're starting to kick in … sorry . '' \\n▁ silence answered me and i looked over at sawyer who was sitting very tall and straight on the couch , her eyes wide . \\n▁ ` ` you what ? '' \\n▁ i scrunched my brows at her odd expression . \\n▁ ` ` i took a couple pills , so i could rest . \\n▁ it 's no big deal , sawyer . '' \\n▁ i put a hand on her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` relax . '' \\n▁ she looked at my hand briefly before leaning into me and cupping my face , her eyes searching mine intently . \\n▁ i inhaled quickly at her closeness and nervous energy shot through me . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ her face and voice took on that ` too old for seventeen ' tone that it sometimes could . \\n▁ ` ` how many did you take , lucas ? '' \\n▁ i scoffed and pulled away from her , grasping her hands with mine . \\n▁ ` ` two … relax . '' \\n▁ i held her hands firmly when she tried to lift them to my face again . \\n▁ my brows drew together , a little irritably , and her face scrunched to match mine . \\n▁ ` ` drugs , lucas ? \\n▁ i thought you did n't do drugs ? '' \\n▁ feeling ashamed and angered by her question , and her tone , i tossed her hands away and stood up from the couch . \\n▁ ` ` i took two pills to help me sleep , sawyer . \\n▁ it 's no big deal . \\n▁ you 're acting like i ' m a drug addict ! '' \\n▁ she stood as well and stepped in front of me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's dangerous , lucas . \\n▁ it 's too easy to … '' she closed her mouth and slowly shook her head , her dark hair rippling around the edges of my letterman 's jacket that she wore every day . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not a good habit to start . '' \\n▁ she stepped closer to me , ignoring whatever odor i was surely producing , and put a hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` please . '' \\n▁ i looked down at her suddenly concerned face , her eyes starting to mist over . \\n▁ confused , i could only say , ` ` i just want to sleep , sawyer . \\n▁ i just … i need … '' i shrugged and my shoulders suddenly felt like concrete blocks . \\n▁ ` ` i just want to sleep my way through this . \\n▁ through all of this … '' her arms encircled me as she held me tight . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't , luc . '' \\n▁ i felt her exhale in a stuttered breath and i put my arms around her protectively , drawing her in tight . \\n▁ ` ` please … do n't … '' she shook her head against my chest . \\n▁ ` ` find another way to deal with it … '' i leaned over her , resting my head on hers and savoring her warmth . \\n▁ i felt lighter with her near me , safer with her holding me . \\n▁ feeling like i could do anything with her arms around me , i finally sighed and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` okay , sawyer … i wo n't take them anymore . \\n▁ i promise . '' \\n▁ i ran a hand down her back , through her hair and we started to sway together slightly . \\n▁ she nodded against my chest and we held each other for a few long moments . \\n▁ as time pressed in on us , we finally pulled apart . \\n▁ she wiped her slightly wet eyes and looked up at me . \\n▁ i brought a hand to her cheek and frowned . \\n▁ i 'd seemingly hurt her and i did n't understand why . \\n▁ i shook my head and whispered , ` ` i ' m sorry , if i. . . \\n▁ worried you . '' \\n▁ with my hand still on her cheek , my thumb starting to brush back and forth across her cheekbone , she nodded slightly . \\n▁ her lips parted as we faced each other and that warm , comfortable feeling took hold over me . \\n▁ i could make it through the day if i knew i 'd get this moment of peace with her . \\n▁ it was n't the same as the hours of school that we used to have , but for now , it would have to do . \\n▁ without thinking about it , i lowered my head and lightly pressed my lips to hers . \\n▁ i was only aware of doing it after the fact . \\n▁ i pulled apart from her , my eyes wide and fearful . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ had i just crossed the lines of our friendship again ? \\n▁ how often would she put up with me jerking her around emotionally ? \\n▁ ` ` sorry , '' i immediately sputtered . \\n▁ her eyes were half closed and her breath faster . \\n▁ i dropped my hand from caressing her cheek as her eyes opened fully and met mine . \\n▁ her cheeks faintly deepened in color and she looked away from me . \\n▁ ` ` we should … we should go over your homework , '' she muttered as she stepped away from me and sat down on the couch . \\n▁ i ran a hand through my hair and cursed under my breath . \\n▁ god , lucas … what happened to not being misleading ? \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ i carefully sat down beside her , watching her face for any signs of anger or embarrassment . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , for doing this for me . '' \\n▁ she nodded as she picked up the stack of papers that had fallen from my hand when i stood up . \\n▁ she started flicking through them , picking out notes she 'd written , a lot of notes actually . \\n▁ i watched her carefully while she went over all the assignments she 'd gathered for me . \\n▁ i realized i would n't be so bored anymore while she went over lesson after lesson . \\n▁ i tuned out the work as i watched her . \\n▁ she seemed fine … but she did avoid looking at me directly . \\n▁ when she was finished , she glanced at a clock on the wall . \\n▁ ` ` damn , i ' m late . '' \\n▁ she grabbed her bag and stood up , still not looking at me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll come by tomorrow , okay . \\n▁ maybe i 'll skip out of club early and we 'll have a little more time together . '' \\n▁ she walked past me and started for the door . \\n▁ i stood up and reached out for her , just catching her fingers as she hurried away from me . \\n▁ she looked back at me , her eyes guarded . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry about earlier , sawyer . \\n▁ sometimes i just … i do n't think . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , feeling really stupid . \\n▁ she cocked her head at me as her eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` no … sometimes you do n't . \\n▁ you 're either pushing me away or pulling me close , lucas . '' \\n▁ she shook her head and removed her fingers from mine . \\n▁ ` ` one day you 'll have to decide what direction you want to go . '' \\n▁ she backed away , searching my face , and then turned and opened the door . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll see you tomorrow . '' \\n▁ she looked down and her face was distraught when she raised it . \\n▁ ` ` please , do n't take any more of those pills . '' \\n▁ i nodded and she started to leave . \\n▁ right as she disappeared , her black head came back to look at me , her lips twisted into a grimace . \\n▁ ` ` and maybe tomorrow … you could shower . '' \\n▁ although it was hard , i did what sawyer asked , and stopped taking the sleeping pills . \\n▁ i was n't addicted to them or anything , but it was tempting to know that i could be sleeping , could be with lil , but had to wait until my body was ready for sleep , instead of trying to force it there . \\n▁ when it took a few days for the drugs to fully leech out , for my body to not feel sluggish during the day , i realized i may have been overdoing them , and was grateful for sawyer 's request . \\n▁ she was right , they were n't a good idea . \\n▁ and i did still get to see my friends . \\n▁ my good dreams kept up , even after i stopped medicating myself . \\n▁ it was a perfectly warm spring day , and i was walking in a field alongside a stream near my house . \\n▁ the sound of water gently splashing over small boulders met my ears and warmth from the sun hit my face . \\n▁ light peeked through holes in the cloud cover and the tall , green grass tickling my bare feet was highlighted with sections of those bright rays . \\n▁ the field almost looked like a giant chessboard , and there , standing in the space where the queen would rest , was my queen , her hands clasped behind her and a beatific smile upon her face as she waited for me . \\n▁ my smile matched hers as i walked through the patches of darkness and light to where she stood , drenched in rays of golden sunshine . \\n▁ her pale hair nearly outshone that sun and the loose fabric of her light pink dress fluttered in the gentle breeze , lifting a bit at the knee to hint at the shapely thighs underneath . \\n▁ coming to join her in that patch of sunlight , i cupped her soft cheek and exhaled in relief at the contact . \\n▁ firm but tender skin met my fingertips and once again , holding her was as real to me as anything i 'd ever felt while awake . \\n▁ her chin lifted and her blue eyes caught the light and sparkled with life . \\n▁ she leaned into me and i leaned down , her lips warm and soft when we connected . \\n▁ i pulled away from her slowly , one hand snaking around her slim waist to sit at the small of her back , the other sliding from her cheek to finger the thin strap of her dress . \\n▁ ` ` hey , barbie , i missed you . '' \\n▁ she laughed in kind as her warm hands moved to rest on my chest . \\n▁ ` ` i missed you too , luc … and do n't call me that . '' \\n▁ i chuckled at the familiar argument and pulled my arm tighter , pulling her body flush to mine . \\n▁ i kissed her softly before responding . \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ her hand ran up and down my chest , feeling the muscles under my thin shirt . \\n▁ i bit my lip as i watched her eyes follow the path of her fingers . \\n▁ ` ` because , it implies that i ' m fake and xxunk . '' \\n▁ her eyes lifted to meet mine and the corner of her lip rose in a wry smile . \\n▁ ` ` and i ' m not . '' \\n▁ i leaned down to kiss those smirking lips , lingering on the corner , as the smell of her filled me . \\n▁ she was so real . \\n▁ ` ` i know you 're not , lil … you 're real . '' \\n▁ i pulled back and gave her a wry grin of my own . \\n▁ ` ` and i think you 're being a little unfair to barbie . '' \\n▁ her head tilted back in a laugh and her eyes danced with happiness when they met mine again . \\n▁ i swallowed a bit , at the vision of this beautiful woman before me , and i could n't quite contain the calmness of my breath . \\n▁ her body twisted in my arms as she managed to get even closer to me , one of her legs sneaking between mine . \\n▁ ` ` oh , how am i being unfair ? '' \\n▁ i tried to smile , but my breath was definitely faster as blood rushed through my body . \\n▁ she felt real and as always i was super aware of every inch of her that was in contact with me : my hand against the firm contour of her back , her leg against my knee , her h * ps pressed against my thigh , her stomach pressed against mine , her hands running over my chest , her mouth inches from mine . \\n▁ ` ` well , '' i said breathily . \\n▁ ` ` look at everything she 's done with her life : doctor , lawyer , vet , teacher … '' she laughed again and brought her nose up to mine , rubbing it against me lightly as our mouths got even closer . \\n▁ ` ` great . \\n▁ so now i ' m xxunk and flighty . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes and sought her lips , finding them ready and eager . \\n▁ we pressed against each other equally , both needing the other , but she pulled back before i could deepen the kiss . \\n▁ her breath heavier , her eyes filling with desire , she ran her hands up my chest to slink around my neck . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not flighty … i know exactly what i want . '' \\n▁ i exhaled heavily at her words , my heart racing . \\n▁ ` ` i want you , lil . '' \\n▁ her hands reached up to clutch the back of my hair . \\n▁ ` ` i want you too , lucas . '' \\n▁ without another word , my hand at her shoulder clasped her neck and pulled her mouth to mine . \\n▁ passion ignited us both and our tender and soft kisses turned into searing and scorching kisses . \\n▁ i leaned back , pulling her with me and let myself fall onto my back . \\n▁ she came with , our lips breaking for a short laugh as , instead of harshly landing on the grass , we landed on the soft mattress of my bed . \\n▁ i rolled her over , my hand slipping up her thigh and under her dress as a cloud passed across the sun , momentarily darkening the section of the field we were still in . \\n▁ she sighed and arched her back as my hand slid farther and farther up , sliding effortlessly up her creamy skin . \\n▁ her hands in my hair tangled more , pulling me into her kiss deeper and deeper . \\n▁ her tongue met and stroked mine , tasting , savoring . \\n▁ she tasted like she always did , she smelled like she always did , she felt like she always did . \\n▁ my hand finally reached all the way up her leg to cup her backside and i groaned softly when nothing impeded its progress ; she was n't wearing any underwear . \\n▁ ` ` oh god , lil , '' i muttered , as i dropped my head to the crook of her neck . \\n▁ she moaned lightly and moved her hip against my body . \\n▁ blood surged straight down to my lower body and i hardened almost painfully . \\n▁ i rocked against her hip and let out a ragged breath . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m ready , lil . \\n▁ i ' m finally ready . '' \\n▁ i pulled back to look at her , passion in her eyes , her mouth open and waiting for mine . \\n▁ so perfect , so beautiful and so real . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to stop this time . '' \\n▁ she closed her eyes and pulled my hair , roughly bringing my lips back to hers . \\n▁ as a new intensity seized us , one of her hands let go of my hair and trailed down my body . \\n▁ she snaked it between us , unzipped my jeans and ran a hand along the length of me , wrapping her hot fingers around the me . \\n▁ i groaned and rocked against her firm grasp , biting my lip at the sensation . \\n▁ ` ` lil … '' my hand cupping her bottom moved around to the front and lightly slid along her slick skin . \\n▁ i gasped at the wetness and muttered something incoherent . \\n▁ she groaned and bucked against my hand and almost unintentionally , my finger slid inside her . \\n▁ she gripped me tighter and i shuddered and rocked against her hand stroking me , simultaneously bringing another finger inside her . \\n▁ she moaned and rocked against me hard . \\n▁ ` ` luc , do n't stop … '' barely coherent of anything but the feel of my fingers sliding inside of her and her firm hand sliding along the length of me , i miraculously did notice something . \\n▁ everything outside of my outdoor bed had stopped . \\n▁ the shadows moving across us stopped . \\n▁ the sounds of the brook beside us stopped . \\n▁ the rustle of leaves high in the trees stopped . \\n▁ the squeaks of the birds calling to their mates stopped . \\n▁ i ' m sure even the sun stopped . \\n▁ it was as if the whole world was holding its breath and nothing existed but lil and i. . . \\n▁ and this moment . \\n▁ this was the moment we 'd never gotten to have in real life . \\n▁ this was the moment we 'd finally get to have here , in my dream world . \\n▁ i was sure it was going to kill me afterwards , but for right now … i was ready . \\n▁ i removed my hand from her , lil gasping and clutching me close when i did . \\n▁ i gently removed her hand from around me . \\n▁ she looked at me then , her eyes blurry with need . \\n▁ never breaking eye contact , i slid my jeans down , scrunched her dress up , and moved on top of her . \\n▁ our clothes vanished at that point and our skin rubbed together , hers , warm and soft as she adjusted herself beneath me . \\n▁ her hand caressed my cheek and a strange expression crossed her face , almost sad . \\n▁ i paused as i watched the emotion pass over her . \\n▁ ` ` lil ? '' \\n▁ she bit her lip and nodded and i pressed myself at her entrance , feeling the wet warmth urging me forward . \\n▁ i took a deep breath and lil did the same , both of us preparing for something bigger than each of us . \\n▁ leaning in to kiss her , i slowly pressed forward . \\n▁ we both gasped as the tip of me slipped in . \\n▁ it was intense … and only the beginning . \\n▁ i panted against her lips , her breath matching mine , and adjusted myself for that first push . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ a loud knock on the door and my mom 's insistent voice , instantly brought me back to reality . \\n▁ my mind at least , my body was still struggling with the emotions i 'd just left behind . \\n▁ i cursed silently and gulped down air , trying to steady my breathing . \\n▁ i carefully sat up in bed and noted that once again , dreams sometimes equal real life . \\n▁ i was hard as a rock . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ nice timing , mom . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i said , with what i hoped was a groggy voice . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , honey , i need to get going to work … but someone 's here to see you . '' \\n▁ my mom 's voice through the door was rushed , like she was running late , and i quickly threw out a thanks so she would leave me and my ` ` situation '' alone . \\n▁ i wished whoever else was out there would leave too . \\n▁ then i got nervous that maybe it was sawyer . \\n▁ i really did n't need her seeing me like this . \\n▁ i stood up and tried to think about something other than my dream … like who was visiting at this hour . \\n▁ i did n't really think sawyer would come before school and could n't help but wonder who would . \\n▁ as the remnants of my dream faded from me , sadness swept through me . \\n▁ that dream had been so real … and new . \\n▁ i 'd wanted it to keep going and i 'd wanted it to end . \\n▁ the opposite emotions cleared the sleep from my system and … evened my blood flow . \\n▁ by the time i opened my door , i was physically , nearly normal . \\n▁ emotionally , i was all over the place . \\n▁ i looked around as i entered into the living room , but i did n't see my mom anywhere . \\n▁ it was unusual for her to leave without saying goodbye to me face to face . \\n▁ even if i was still sleeping , she 'd crack open the door to look me over before saying goodbye . \\n▁ whoever was here must have really frazzled her . \\n▁ i wondered who that could be , nervous knots tightening my stomach . \\n▁ cautiously , i walked into the kitchen and froze immediately in the doorway , my breath catching . \\n▁ a body sat at the table , staring at their hands . \\n▁ ` ` sheriff whitney ? '' \\n▁ i said timidly , as i took a step into the room . \\n▁ it was n't that i had n't seen the sheriff since that night , but like always upon first seeing him , memories flooded me . \\n▁ painful memories . \\n▁ a past tense voice filled my head as i took in his imposing form , dressed in the head to toe tan of his uniform , ` i ' m sorry lucas … they 're all gone … ' i shoved back that horrid conversation and focused on the present tense version of the sheriff before me . \\n▁ he turned to look at me as i entered , his steely eyes shifting over my body before resting on my face . \\n▁ i flushed slightly , hoping that my situation had calmed down enough that he could n't tell . \\n▁ i did n't think he 'd mention it or anything , but still , it was embarrassing . \\n▁ i swallowed back my unease and went over to the table , taking the seat opposite him . \\n▁ curiosity overtook me and i spoke into the still air . \\n▁ ` ` why are you here ? '' \\n▁ i realized how rude my saying that to a man , who , was first and foremost a cop , was , right after i said it . \\n▁ i blushed more , but sat quietly , waiting for some response . \\n▁ he sighed and ran an aged hand through his silver hair . \\n▁ ` ` your mom . \\n▁ she told me about what happened at school - your being suspended . '' \\n▁ my eyes widened at that . \\n▁ she told him ? \\n▁ him , of all people ? \\n▁ a lawman who could possibly … well , i do n't know what he could do about it , so long after the fact , but still , what was she thinking ? \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ um … '' i sputtered on my words , not having any idea what to say . \\n▁ his eyes narrowed at me . \\n▁ ` ` i know you ' ve been through a lot , son , more than most your age . '' \\n▁ he hung his head , our eyes breaking contact and again his past voice entered my brain - ` they 're all gone … ' i clenched my jaw , holding onto my emotions by a thin thread while he continued . \\n▁ ` ` that night was horrid … for a lot of people . '' \\n▁ he looked back up at me and i begged my eyes not to water . \\n▁ ` ` but i hope you are smart enough to not go down this path . '' \\n▁ he shook his head lightly as the steel gaze in his eyes softened to concern . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve seen so many lose their way like that , with drugs or alcohol . \\n▁ do n't let yourself be one of them , luc . \\n▁ you 're stronger than that . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open at his implication . \\n▁ he 'd believed i was n't drinking that night , but now he thought i was a xxunk ? \\n▁ ` ` i did n't … i ' m not … '' i took a deep breath to calm myself . \\n▁ ` ` someone slipped me something . \\n▁ i do n't use drugs . '' \\n▁ his steel gaze returned . \\n▁ ` ` yes , your mother said as much . '' \\n▁ he nodded thoughtfully while i thought about that . \\n▁ my mom had believed me readily when i 'd told her someone had dosed me . \\n▁ of course , she would , she believed everything i 'd told her of late . \\n▁ she 'd passed that information on to the sheriff , for some odd reason , and he seemed to believe it as well . \\n▁ i wondered what he 'd do with that information . \\n▁ well , whatever he managed to ferret out about the incident , he would n't get the information from me . \\n▁ i was n't about to give up josh 's name - not to the school , or my mom , and definitely not to sheriff whitney . \\n▁ i already had enough trouble being accepted in this town , no need to add ` ` xxunk '' to my list of reasons for people to hate me . \\n▁ the sheriff adjusted himself in his chair , leaning forward over his hands clasped together in the center of the small table . \\n▁ i involuntarily leaned back , maintaining the space between us . \\n▁ ` ` i just hope you 'll think about what i said . \\n▁ maybe that will shape how you react to this … to all of this . '' \\n▁ he stood and put a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ i looked up at him , torn between a desire to yell my innocence , and a desire to burst into tears at the flood of emotions that always resided in me . \\n▁ ` ` it will get better , luc … you 'll see . '' \\n▁ he looked as if he wanted to say more , his face wrestling with some emotion before returning to the air of professionalism he generally wore . \\n▁ he patted my shoulder a few times while i ridiculously nodded . \\n▁ was i agreeing with him ? \\n▁ if i was , it was n't voluntary . \\n▁ he nodded back and then walked from the kitchen , leaving me with my swirling thoughts . \\n▁ a vague remnant of my dream rose up in me , ' i want you too , lucas ' , followed immediately by the sheriff 's haunting words that night , ` they 're all gone . ' \\n▁ i closed my eyes and forced out everything , only allowing myself to listen to the sheriff 's vehicle as it pulled away . \\n▁ seeing the sheriff disturbed the remainder of my day . \\n▁ sawyer noticed when she came by after school . \\n▁ although she usually did ask if i was alright , and if my ` ` vacation '' was going okay , she surprisingly hounded me for a more honest answer when i 'd given her the typical ` fine ' response . \\n▁ maybe it had been the look on my face , or maybe i 'd freaked her out enough with the pills that she just was n't going to let generic answers fly anymore . \\n▁ whatever the case , she 'd kept up on xxunk out my mood until i 'd confessed about the sheriff 's visit . \\n▁ it was n't as though the visit was bad , or he 'd done or said anything to upset me , not really anyway , but seeing him again , and especially being alone with him , had opened up wounds from that evening , and the fresh scars hurt . \\n▁ instead of going over the day 's homework with me , sawyer had sat with me on the couch , holding my hand and telling me that she 'd help me through it . \\n▁ that she was n't going anywhere and she 'd help me through everything . \\n▁ she assured me that i only had one more school day and one last weekend , and then we 'd be together for most of the day , almost every day . \\n▁ i clasped her hand gratefully , not sure what i 'd do without her , and both looked forward to being at school with her again , and dreaded being at school with her again . \\n▁ i 'd left sort of a mess behind with my spectacle in the gym . \\n▁ the students were n't going to easily let me forget about that . \\n▁ my mother said nothing about the sheriff 's surprise visit when she came home late that night , only asking me how my day went and asking me how i was . \\n▁ my answer to both was most predictably - fine . \\n▁ she nodded and accepted that and gave me a soft kiss on the head before yawning and walking down the hall to her room . \\n▁ i watched the spot where she 'd left my sight for a long while before standing and heading to my room , hopeful that maybe i could bring lil to me . \\n▁ i was n't really looking to continue what we 'd been about to do this morning ; i just needed her to talk to me . \\n▁ i needed her tonight . \\n▁ i needed her comfort . \\n▁ my head had no sooner hit the pillow that i was suddenly sitting upright … and behind the wheel of a car . \\n▁ confused , i started panicking . \\n▁ i did n't drive , i did n't ever drive . \\n▁ not anymore , not since the night of the crash . \\n▁ why was i behind the wheel ? \\n▁ and whose car was it ? \\n▁ i did n't even own a car ? \\n▁ my hands tightened on the wheel and my heart surged painfully as thick drops splattered on the windshield . \\n▁ the rubber wiper squealed in protest as it flicked rapidly back and forth across the glass , more smearing the rain than removing it . \\n▁ i could barely make out the yellow slashes in the middle of the asphalt . \\n▁ i could n't peel my eyes away from the road and my breath started hitching as i lifted my foot off the gas and prepared to slam it on the brakes . \\n▁ i wanted to stop . \\n▁ ` ` hey , i would n't do that . '' \\n▁ i twisted my head sharply to the right and let out a heavy exhale at who i saw seated next to me . \\n▁ ` ` darren ? '' \\n▁ he twisted his lips and smiled at me and i instantly started relaxing . \\n▁ it was just a dream . \\n▁ i should have instinctually known that , but usually in dreams you do n't . \\n▁ my grip on the wheel , the wheel of darren 's geo i suddenly realized , loosened . \\n▁ i took in a deep breath and tried to calm myself , looking back to the road and focusing on the yellow lines again . \\n▁ ` ` what are we doing here ? \\n▁ i do n't drive darren … ever . '' \\n▁ i tried to lift my foot off the gas again so the car would gradually slow to a stop , but i could n't raise my foot , and the car actually sped up . \\n▁ darren beside me chuckled and i glanced at him . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i know miss daisy . '' \\n▁ his amusement softened to seriousness . \\n▁ ` ` that 's why i ' m here . \\n▁ i 'll stay with you , lucas . '' \\n▁ he put his hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m with you , man . '' \\n▁ i swallowed and focused on the road again , wishing i could control my dream right now , change the setting , slow the car … stop the car . \\n▁ i thought of slamming the brakes again and my foot lifted from the gas successfully . \\n▁ darren coughed beside me and pointed his finger at my foot and then shook his head side to side while wagging his finger . \\n▁ i scrunched my brows in confusion and frustration and dropped my foot back to the gas . \\n▁ he raised his eyebrows at me . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't slam the brakes , lucas . \\n▁ i know you want to , but you ca n't . \\n▁ that 's how you lost control the first time . '' \\n▁ he shook his head at me again . \\n▁ ` ` did you learn nothing from license to drive ? '' \\n▁ i relaxed farther and even laughed a little . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ i almost forgot your theory that all of life 's lessons can be learned through watching eighties movies . '' \\n▁ he chuckled beside me and i turned to watch his happy face , momentarily forgetting my horror at driving again . \\n▁ ` ` that 's right . '' \\n▁ he held his hand up to me and started ticking off fingers . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve got the breakfast club - everyone can learn to get along if they 're locked in a room long enough , '' he ticked off another finger while i laughed silently next to him , my eyes still glued to his , ` ` top gun - face your fear head on and you 're sure to conquer it , '' he splayed his fingers out and sighed contently , closing his dark eyes , ` ` and my personal favorite … weird science . '' \\n▁ i frowned and cocked my head at him . \\n▁ i 'd seen that movie before , and aside from kids turning a barbie into the world 's most perfect woman , i did n't see any profound meaning in it . \\n▁ ` ` what is there to learn in weird science ? '' \\n▁ he opened his eyes , the glint in them matching the xxunk of his grin . \\n▁ ` ` oh … the things kelly xxunk could teach me . '' \\n▁ i laughed heartily at that and shook my head . \\n▁ darren twisted his lips at me while i was still laughing at him . \\n▁ ` ` speaking of women … what 's up with you and lil ? '' \\n▁ i took a hand off of the wheel and twisted even more , so my body was nearly facing him . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ he raised an eyebrow at me . \\n▁ ` ` um , i think you know . \\n▁ a little meeting in a field , a bed suddenly appearing , clothes suddenly vanishing … you remembering any of this ? '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes and narrowed them at him . \\n▁ ` ` you were supposed to butt out of those dreams . '' \\n▁ he sighed slowly . \\n▁ ` ` luc … you ca n't do this , man . \\n▁ you ca n't be with her like that … not anymore . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ca n't i ? \\n▁ it 's my dream … my head . '' \\n▁ my tone was getting a little irritated , but i could n't help it . \\n▁ darren shook his head , holding my gaze with his . \\n▁ ` ` because it 's stupid . \\n▁ you 'll only hurt yourself . \\n▁ all of this is stupid . \\n▁ you should be letting us go , not pulling us tighter . '' \\n▁ i leaned into him , my free hand going to my chest . \\n▁ ` ` you know what , my life kind of sucks ! \\n▁ and your a * * hole of a brother is n't making anything easier . \\n▁ if i can get even just a moment of peace and comfort when i ' m with my girlfriend , then i ' m going to take all i can get ! '' \\n▁ darren 's face stormed up as he looked at his lap . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m gon na kick josh 's ass for drugging you , '' he muttered . \\n▁ lifting his head , he brought his intense gaze to my equally intense gaze . \\n▁ ` ` but that does n't change the fact that you should n't be hiding out with us in your dreams . '' \\n▁ he shook his head roughly as his eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` she 's not your girlfriend anymore ! \\n▁ you ca n't keep ignoring real relationships for lil , for us - we 're dead , luc . \\n▁ let us be dead ! '' \\n▁ sudden and unexplainable anger shot through me . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't bring you here , darren . \\n▁ if you do n't want to see me , then do n't show up ! '' \\n▁ i instantly regretted saying that , as i loved seeing him . \\n▁ i immediately cooled and wanted to take back my words , but darren scowled and turned away from me , biting his lip to hold in his quick temper . \\n▁ the scowl vanished from his mouth as it fell open slightly . \\n▁ he noticeably paled before slowly turning back to face me . \\n▁ with a soft voice he said , ` ` hey , man , i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ my eyebrows drew to a point as i tried to figure out why he was sorry for my outburst . \\n▁ ` ` what … why ? \\n▁ i ' m sorry , man , i should n't have said that . '' \\n▁ he slowly shook his head and pointed out the windshield . \\n▁ i startled , remembering that i was n't really in a nice dream , having a friendly spat with darren . \\n▁ i was in a nightmare , driving along a wet , dark road - the wet , dark road . \\n▁ my head snapped around followed closely by my body and i harshly gripped the wheel with both hands , trying to focus on what i was doing . \\n▁ my heart shifted to triple time and my breath came in ragged pulls as i could easily make out a disturbingly familiar curve in the road through the rain - streaked windshield . \\n▁ darren 's voice echoed hauntingly at my side . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , this is the part you 're not going to like . '' \\n▁ the car started to skim across the water and i instinctively slammed on the brakes . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; ` ` i have some assignments for you . '' \\n▁ i smiled genuinely and relaxed back into the pillows , grateful that she was n't going to ask about my breakdown , grateful that she was n't even going to mention it . \\n▁ i laughed lightly and ran a hand across my eyes , hoping to wipe away the remnants of my despondency . \\n▁ ` ` oh good … i was getting a little bored . '' \\n▁ she gave me a quick smile , her eyes glancing over my face before resting on mine again . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll just go get my bag . '' \\n▁ her face hardened into seriousness . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be right back , lucas . '' \\n▁ i swallowed and nodded while she slipped out of my bed and out of my room . \\n▁ i flung an arm over my eyes and tried to not be too embarrassed over my meltdown . \\n▁ i still was though . \\n▁ just as i was thinking that i should go out to her , i felt her return to my room and heard her rummage through her bag . \\n▁ i peered out from under my arm when i felt her lift the covers and crawl back into bed with me . \\n▁ she 'd taken my letterman 's jacket off and draped it over her bag on the floor , and was playing with the too - long sleeves of her shirt , as she balanced a book on her knees under my sheets . \\n▁ i sat up and leaned back against the wall , smiling at her familiar habit . \\n▁ when i was somewhat alert enough to listen to my homework , she started laying everything out for me . \\n▁ i cringed over our math homework and smiled over the easy essay ms . reynolds had given us . \\n▁ before i knew it , sawyer was glancing at a clock on the wall and cursing , muttering that she was late . \\n▁ she slipped out of my bed and started putting her stuff back together . \\n▁ i scooted around to the edge and sat up , putting my feet on the ground . \\n▁ i watched her shove stuff in her bag and hurriedly put my jacket back on . \\n▁ this was the last time she 'd be coming over to give me my homework assignment . \\n▁ i was n't sure if her protective parents would even let her visit after this , and her being in my room right now may be the last time that ever happened . \\n▁ i reached out for her hand once she had everything all ready to go . \\n▁ i found it swinging freely at her side and laced our fingers together . \\n▁ she looked down at where we joined and smiling softly , looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , sawyer … for everything . '' \\n▁ i softened my gaze and hoped that she understood that by ` everything ' i truly did mean everything - much more than just bringing me my homework daily . \\n▁ she may not understand , but she 'd helped me practically survive my isolation . \\n▁ i do n't think i could have done it without her . \\n▁ her eyes watered as she held my gaze . \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome , lucas . '' \\n▁ she swallowed and shook her head lightly . \\n▁ ` ` well , i guess i 'll see you monday then . \\n▁ i 'll kind of miss coming over . '' \\n▁ she cocked her head to the side as her thoughts ran in line with mine ; i was going to miss that too . \\n▁ she shrugged lightly . \\n▁ ` ` maybe my parents will be okay with short visits … '' she let the sentence trail off and bit her lip . \\n▁ i smiled and nodded , trying not to get my hopes up . \\n▁ ` ` i hope so … i 'd really like that . '' \\n▁ she nodded and i stood up , encircling her in a warm hug . \\n▁ she paused for a moment and then returned the gesture . \\n▁ i resisted the urge to kiss her head and whisper just how much she meant to me . \\n▁ i resisted the urge to tell her how sorry i was that i was so messed up emotionally , that i could n't give her what i suspected she wanted from me . \\n▁ and i resisted the urge to pull her in tighter , to never let her go . \\n▁ instead of all that , i held her for another couple seconds , and then i let go and took a step back . \\n▁ ` ` see ya monday , sawyer . '' \\n▁ she nodded and adjusted her bag on her shoulder before turning to exit my room . \\n▁ i stopped her at the door . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer ? '' \\n▁ she turned and looked back at me inquisitively . \\n▁ ` ` how bad is school going to be ? '' \\n▁ she grimaced and looked down . \\n▁ i did n't take that as a good sign . \\n▁ sighing , she reluctantly raised her head to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` most people think you took something , got high or drunk … or something . \\n▁ i heard brittany saying that she saw you take some pills outside of art class . '' \\n▁ she shook her head while i frowned at the predictable gossip mill . \\n▁ ` ` and then , that bitch spends most of choir telling stories about how you get messed up every night and show up on her doorstep , trying to have sex with her . '' \\n▁ a faint blush filled her cheeks as anger went through her . \\n▁ ` ` she always looks at me when she says that , like you 're cheating on me or something . '' \\n▁ her face went white after she said that . \\n▁ ` ` not that we 're a couple . \\n▁ it 's just … they all believe that we … '' i shook my head as she sputtered a few times , trying to explain herself . \\n▁ ` ` i know , sawyer . \\n▁ i understand . '' \\n▁ the school had unfortunately linked sawyer to me from practically day one , even with my failed attempts to not bring unwanted attention to her . \\n▁ i frowned as i considered brittany 's flat - out lies . \\n▁ interesting that she 'd paint me in that light for the school . \\n▁ well , i always had suspected that she was more interested in me than she let on . \\n▁ this was a way for her to live out a fantasy with me and make me look even worse , all at the same time . \\n▁ win - win for her , i suppose . \\n▁ it was n't like i was going to call her out on the lie . \\n▁ no one would believe me anyway . \\n▁ i smiled crookedly , knowing no humor was in my face . \\n▁ ` ` oh well , i suppose it could be worse . '' \\n▁ i sighed as she nodded and looked down . \\n▁ i remembered my suspicions that she was being ridiculed more than she let me see and walked over to her , placing a hand on her arm . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay , sawyer ? \\n▁ do they … am i making things worse for you ? \\n▁ would it be better for you , if we were n't friends ? '' \\n▁ i whispered that last part , hoping she was n't going to say ` ` yes '' and take the opportunity to walk away from me . \\n▁ her head snapped up and her wide eyes looked over my face , surprised . \\n▁ ` ` no , no , lucas … do n't ever think that . '' \\n▁ her hand sneaked up to rest on my chest and she took a step closer to me . \\n▁ ` ` you make my life better , lucas . \\n▁ if you only knew how much … '' she bit her lip and shook her head , her eyes starting to water again . \\n▁ i scrunched my brow , confused , and started to ask a question , but she interrupted me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't worry about what they say to me . \\n▁ i do n't care . \\n▁ none of that matters to me - the clicks , the gossip , i do n't care . '' \\n▁ she brought her other hand up to rest it on my chest , her fingers lightly pressing into me as she leaned closer . \\n▁ ` ` this is what matters to me . '' \\n▁ she swallowed and searched my face . \\n▁ ` ` you … you are what matters to me . '' \\n▁ i swallowed and warmth flooded through me . \\n▁ my comfort , the only living person who really brought me true peace , found peace in me as well . \\n▁ i did n't understand how that was possible , how i could in any way bring her joy , but somehow , i seemed to and that thought made me feel content and full - full of something i did n't even know how to completely express . \\n▁ i shook my head at her , a huge smile lighting my face . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't know what that means to me , sawyer . \\n▁ you could n't possibly understand how much i love you . '' \\n▁ i froze as what i 'd just said registered with my head . \\n▁ in all the time i 'd had with lillian , i 'd never actually said those words to her . \\n▁ and here , now , i 'd known sawyer for only a few months and the words had slipped out effortlessly . \\n▁ i watched her face pale and her mouth drop open . \\n▁ i vaguely remembered that this was n't the first time i 'd told her i loved her . \\n▁ some hazy memory of a drug - tainted conversation floated around my head , but embarrassment at my behavior then , and my outburst now , forced it back . \\n▁ not knowing what else to do , and not really understanding what i meant by telling her i loved her , i quickly added , ` ` as a friend , my best friend . '' \\n▁ her mouth closed and she swallowed , a strange emotion momentarily passing over her face before her peaceful smile returned . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , lucas … as my best friend . '' \\n▁ i smiled at her words , and the fact that i 'd gotten myself over that could - be friend altering situation . \\n▁ i pulled her in for a tight hug before pulling back and playfully pushing her away . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd better go . \\n▁ you 're already late and you 'll never convince them to let you come over , if i ' m always getting you home late . '' \\n▁ she laughed and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , you 're right . \\n▁ have a good weekend , lucas . '' \\n▁ mentally i frowned at the prospect of more long days without her , but to her , i only nodded . \\n▁ ` ` you too , sawyer . '' \\n▁ xxrep 15 * monday morning came without much fanfare , just a light drizzle in the crisp november air . \\n▁ i dressed and got ready for school with a knot in my stomach . \\n▁ i 'd been gone for awhile now and while my exile had n't been pleasant , neither was the thought of roaming through those halls again , of feeling all the hot stares and hushed voices as i walked past . \\n▁ i 'd gotten pretty good at tuning that out before the incident , but now it sort of felt like i was starting the year over . \\n▁ well , at least i had sawyer with me . \\n▁ that helped tremendously . \\n▁ finished with getting ready , i smoothed a hand over my white , long - sleeve shirt and studied myself in the mirror of the bathroom . \\n▁ i 'd run some product through my wavy hair , trying to tame the mess , and shaved this morning , but even to my eyes i looked freaked out . \\n▁ the hazel irises staring at me in the mirror were just a bit too wide , the breath coming out of the pale lips before me , just a bit too fast . \\n▁ i splashed some water on my face and closed my eyes , taking long , deep breaths . \\n▁ i did n't need another bout of panic attacks . \\n▁ after my first horrid day of school , those had actually subsided and i did n't need them popping up again . \\n▁ of course , i also attributed that to sawyer and her calming presence . \\n▁ i opened my eyes and forced a smile to my stressed face . \\n▁ i 'd see her soon and most , if not all , of my anxiety would slip away with her perky smile . \\n▁ i shuffled out to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee for my mother and me . \\n▁ she 'd been out late last night , picking up an extra shift at the diner and i 'd woken up before her . \\n▁ i made the pot extra strong , feeling like we 'd both need the boost today . \\n▁ just as i was sitting down at the small table , she appeared in the doorway , yawning and stretching slightly . \\n▁ she smiled at me and ruffled my hair , ruining whatever semblance of put togetherness i 'd achieved this morning . \\n▁ it did n't really matter to me , so i returned her warm smile . \\n▁ she frowned when she saw it and i realized i was still using my forced smile , my face would n't relax into a genuine one . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to call the school , lucas ? \\n▁ one more day surely would n't hurt anything . '' \\n▁ she ran a hand down my cheek , looking over my features as she worried about me . \\n▁ i swallowed and attempted to smooth out my rigid smile . \\n▁ ` ` no , one more day wo n't help anything either . \\n▁ i need to get this over with . '' \\n▁ she nodded and stared at me for a few more long moments before pouring herself a mug and sitting at her spot at the table , the same spot the sheriff had been at last week . \\n▁ i thought about that conversation as mom took her first sip of the steaming beverage . \\n▁ ` ` did you have a good visit with sheriff whitney last week ? '' \\n▁ she asked quietly . \\n▁ i looked up at her face , a little startled that our thoughts were running so parallel with each other . \\n▁ ` ` um , yeah … i guess . '' \\n▁ i wanted to ask her what she was doing telling such personal things about our life to such a high profile person , but i could n't get the words out to question her . \\n▁ she gave up enough for me already , if she needed someone to talk to … well , i 'd prefer it was n't him , but that was n't really up to me . \\n▁ she nodded and a small smile lit her lips before she took another sip . \\n▁ she grimaced a little bit and i twisted my lips consolingly . \\n▁ ` ` sorry … it 's a little strong , is n't it ? '' \\n▁ she chuckled and looked up at me over her cup . \\n▁ ` ` yes , even for you . '' \\n▁ she lowered her mug and her voice softened . \\n▁ ` ` but , i suppose you needed the extra help today . '' \\n▁ her eyes misted over as she continued staring at me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , lucas … for what today is going to be for you . '' \\n▁ i nodded and darted my eyes down to my mostly full cup . \\n▁ i busied myself with draining it , shutting my head off at the sight of my mom getting emotional over my well being . \\n▁ that sight would surely unhinge me today , and i did n't need it right now . \\n▁ right now , all i needed to do was focus on maintaining my inner peace . \\n▁ the rest would surely work out just fine . \\n▁ i was practically inhaling the bottom of my cup when a honk at the door signaled sawyer 's arrival . \\n▁ a true grin spread on my face as i looked over to the window and saw her checking out her appearance in the rear view mirror . \\n▁ i looked over at my mom to say goodbye and she was watching me with a small , crooked smile . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i asked cautiously . \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` oh , nothing . '' \\n▁ her eyes flicked to the window and then back to me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just glad that there is someone out there who can make your face look like that again . '' \\n▁ her eyes got momentarily wistful , and clouded over again with what could easily become tears . \\n▁ i looked down and shrugged , not wanting to delve into sawyer 's and my relationship . \\n▁ it was too complicated for me to think about on most days , i did n't need her trying to analyze it too . \\n▁ ` ` i better go , she 's waiting . '' \\n▁ she stood and gave me a swift hug . \\n▁ ` ` of course , dear . '' \\n▁ she pulled back to look at me , her eyes slowly sweeping over my face , taking me in . \\n▁ ` ` have a good day , lucas . '' \\n▁ i gave her a half - hearted grin before picking my bag and jacket off the floor near the front door . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll try , '' i said softly , as i slipped them both on . \\n▁ with one last hug to her , i opened the door and waved to sawyer with a surely idiotic grin on my face . \\n▁ it had been a long time since i 'd seen her in the morning . \\n▁ sawyer waved back at me and then my mom in the doorway as i opened her door to get inside . \\n▁ the all too familiar lemon scent washed over me and i was instantly calm . \\n▁ the familiarity of the fragrance eased my breath and my squeezed heart . \\n▁ i exhaled slowly and sank back into the seat as she pulled out of my drive . \\n▁ with one final glance at my mom 's retreating figure at our front door , i turned my head to face sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` hey , '' i said pleasantly , practically with a spring in my voice . \\n▁ she looked over at me and grinned , her face beaming under that curtain of straight , dark hair . \\n▁ ` ` hey , yourself . \\n▁ you 're in a much better mood than i expected to find you in . '' \\n▁ she raised an eyebrow at that and then turned her attention back to the road . \\n▁ i laughed and turned my attention to the road , to the threat of school looming before us . \\n▁ ` ` not really , i ' m just glad to see you . '' \\n▁ i felt her turn to look at me and met her gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad to see you too . \\n▁ i ' ve missed this . '' \\n▁ my eyes softened as i looked at her while she turned back to the road , the early morning sun glinting off her freshly applied lip gloss and a strand of dark hair straying close to her eye , begging to be tucked behind her ear . \\n▁ she really was quite beautiful . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , without meaning to say anything . \\n▁ she turned back at me , and her eyes softened as well as they looked over my face . \\n▁ her eyes lingered on my lips and a strange feeling welled up in me before she suddenly broke the contact , and firmly fixed her eyes to the road ahead of us . \\n▁ ` ` well , yeah . '' \\n▁ she shrugged nonchalantly . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't have anyone to complain over my music choices . '' \\n▁ she gave me a sly grin before reaching down and turning up the volume on her indie , chick rock . \\n▁ i groaned dramatically and rolled my eyes , grateful that the odd feeling was leaving me and the familiar comforting peace was returning . \\n▁ we both chuckled as we listened to her man - hater music for the last few minutes before we reached my personal hell - sheridan high . \\n▁ she shut the car off , the music suddenly stopping mid ` i ' m better off alone ' sentence , and i felt a crushing dread close in on me . \\n▁ my chest squeezed as i looked out over the assortment of cars already on the lot . \\n▁ i noticed more than a few - will 's , randy 's , brittany 's , and the battered pickup that josh had been driving this year . \\n▁ looking at the cars was like looking at a lineup of the people who would love to see me be run over by them . \\n▁ i tried not to care , but my chest started hurting and my breath started hitching . \\n▁ it was getting harder and harder to keep it even . \\n▁ a warm hand touched my far cheek , carefully turning my head . \\n▁ i looked over to sawyer 's calm face . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m here , lucas . \\n▁ it will be okay . '' \\n▁ she nodded encouragingly and cupped my cheek with her hand . \\n▁ i swallowed and held eye contact with her , feeling that serenity wash over me . \\n▁ i could do this . \\n▁ just a few more months and i 'd be gone . \\n▁ i could do this . \\n▁ my breath evened and the ache in my chest loosened . \\n▁ with one last long exhale , i nodded my readiness to her and opened the door . \\n▁ we made it all the way to the main building doors with barely more than double takes from the student body . \\n▁ i was starting to feel calm and confident that everything would be fine , well , normal anyway , which was usually me being completely ignored , which was fine . \\n▁ i opened the heavy door and gallantly ushered sawyer inside , her breath a visible puff as she laughed at me in the chilly air . \\n▁ i laughed with her and together , we walked through the doors like any pair of normal high school students . \\n▁ but i was n't normal . \\n▁ i was n't really wanted around here . \\n▁ and as the heavy door slammed shut ominously behind me , i was reminded of that fact but a heated set of eyes . \\n▁ ` ` oh good … you 're back . \\n▁ enjoy your time off ? '' \\n▁ josh leaned back against the row of lockers directly in front of the main doors and sneered at me , his arms crossed over his chest . \\n▁ anger swelled in me , as i thought back to what this little punk did to me two weeks ago - the embarrassment , the banishment , but mainly , the forced separation from my best friend . \\n▁ i did n't give him a chance to say much else , as a low noise surprisingly came out of my chest and the words , ` you son of a bitch ! ' \\n▁ rested on the tip of my tongue . \\n▁ but i did n't get a chance to say it , as my hand was suddenly grabbed and pulled harshly away from my body , and i had little choice but to follow it . \\n▁ i started to pull away from the hand , to return to where a smirking josh was slapping a friend of his across the chest and muttering something that made his small group laugh and point after sawyer and me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't , lucas . \\n▁ he 's not worth it . '' \\n▁ i turned my face and found my voice heated when the words finally did come out . \\n▁ ` ` he drugged me , sawyer . \\n▁ he deserves to get his ass kicked ! '' \\n▁ for a moment , i pictured darren blowing his top and slamming his brother back against the lockers . \\n▁ darren could be fiery when he got going and , while he 'd never taken a swing at his brother , i knew he would have if the situation called for it . \\n▁ and this situation definitely called for it . \\n▁ sawyer continually tugged my hand , pulling me away from the fight i was all geared up for . \\n▁ ` ` true , he does , '' she muttered sullenly . \\n▁ stopping when we finally reached the stairs , she gently put a hand on my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` but not in the middle of the hallway , around all these people . \\n▁ not when you have one strike against you already . \\n▁ you do n't need the trouble , luc . '' \\n▁ i sniffed and my body started to shake with the desire to do … something , hit … something . \\n▁ it had been a long time since pure anger had coursed through me and for a moment , i let that heat rush through my veins and darken my countenance . \\n▁ ` ` maybe i want the trouble , '' i nearly growled . \\n▁ josh had gone too far this time . \\n▁ maybe getting expelled would be worth it . \\n▁ sawyer 's eyes widened , but she was interrupted by a voice behind her before she could say anything to that . \\n▁ ` ` is there a problem here ? '' \\n▁ i looked over sawyer 's shoulder to coach taylor standing behind her . \\n▁ i instantly straightened my stance at seeing the imposing man , who 'd been an authority figure to me for a long time . \\n▁ ` ` no , coach , '' i automatically replied . \\n▁ the heat left me as i stared at him , and my voice lost its hard edge . \\n▁ coach had always been tough , but fair , on darren and me and we 'd grown to respect him . \\n▁ darren used to always joke that coach could be my long gone dad , since he really did look like an older version of me - a crew cut in the same brown as my scruffy head , the same hazel eyes , if a little more intense on him , the same chin , the same nose , the same overall build . \\n▁ i always laughed it off when darren got into hysterics about it though . \\n▁ i may not actually know my … biological , but i knew the coach was not him . \\n▁ for one , i ' ve seen pictures of my dad and he and coach look nothing alike . \\n▁ secondly , i really did n't like to think about coach getting it on with my mom . \\n▁ ugh . \\n▁ coach sniffed and cocked his head as he looked at me and then down the hallway to where josh and his friends were still laughing . \\n▁ ` ` let 's talk , west . '' \\n▁ he crossed his arms over his blue and white polo , the school 's colors , and narrowed his eyes at me . \\n▁ the look in them did not invite questioning . \\n▁ ` ` i have to get to class … '' i shrugged lamely and nodded my head in the direction of the stairs . \\n▁ sawyer beside me shifted uncomfortably , looking like she was n't sure if she should stay by my side or leave me alone with the coach . \\n▁ he sniffed again and twisted his lips , the look on his hard face displeased that i had decided to question him anyway . \\n▁ ` ` that was n't a request . '' \\n▁ i looked down and nodded before giving sawyer a ` sorry ' face , and telling her i 'd meet her in english . \\n▁ she nodded back at me and then quickly glanced over the intimidating man beside me , before hurrying up the stairs . \\n▁ i watched her leave for a second , turning the corner and being followed by what seemed like a squadron of kids , and then i sighed softly and twisted to face the coach . \\n▁ he immediately started in on the speech he 'd probably prepared for me on day one . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve invested a lot of time in you , west , and this is how you repay me ? '' \\n▁ his arms crossed on his chest moved to his h * ps and his face took on a stern look , all sharp angles and hard edges , not looking much like me at all anymore . \\n▁ ` ` you ditch the team your senior year , not even bothering to show up for tryouts this summer , or even telling me you were n't going to . '' \\n▁ he pointed irritably down the hall where a few students were watching us converse , or rather , watching the coach converse at me . \\n▁ ` ` you left me stuck with mckinney as your replacement for god 's sake . '' \\n▁ ` ` will 's good … '' i tried meekly . \\n▁ his eyes narrowed as his voice got even sterner . \\n▁ ` ` will 's got good feet , but his hands are crap . \\n▁ he 's more awkward with the ball than a freshman trying to unhook his first bra . \\n▁ we needed you this year . '' \\n▁ i looked away from him . \\n▁ ` ` things came up … '' he snorted irritably and i looked back . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i know all about what came up . '' \\n▁ his hard eyes took on a disapproving look . \\n▁ ` ` getting hammered with your friends , getting behind the wheel when you should n't have , getting them killed … '' his face surprisingly softened in a way i 'd never seen before , and my throat closed up . \\n▁ god , i did not want to cry in front of this man . \\n▁ he put a hand on my shoulder in a rare show of compassion . \\n▁ ` ` they will be missed … darren especially . '' \\n▁ an odd half smile lightened his face and i blinked at seeing it ; coach did n't smile much , even if we won the game . \\n▁ ` ` now , he had great hands . \\n▁ i 'd of made him quarterback , if he was n't such a great running back . '' \\n▁ as his words died between us , and his momentary softness over the deceased students passed , his eyes and face hardened right back up . \\n▁ i swallowed and tried to focus on what he was saying , and not how he was making me feel . \\n▁ besides the pang of my friends being mentioned , no teacher had yet to outright call me a drunk like that , and my stomach was twisting painfully . \\n▁ coach never was one to mince words though . \\n▁ he removed his hand from my shoulder and stuck both hands on his h * ps again . \\n▁ ` ` i would ' ve taken you back , even with all that . \\n▁ i would have drug tested the hell out of you , and probably kept you on the bench more than usual , but i 'd of taken you back . \\n▁ i 'd of gotten you sober and gotten you back out on that field . '' \\n▁ i sighed and bit my tongue ; he would n't believe my innocence , even if i tried proclaiming it . \\n▁ coach was not easily swayed once he went down a path . \\n▁ and right now he was firmly on the ` lucas has gone to the dark side ' path . \\n▁ he tossed one hand up in the air as he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` but then you go and get high at school , and prance around my pep rally like it 's your own personal rave ! \\n▁ what the hell was that , lucas west ? '' \\n▁ i swallowed my embarrassment and my pride , and bowed my head , not saying anything . \\n▁ finally , he made a disgruntled noise . \\n▁ ` ` sports would have been a better outlet for you , west . \\n▁ it still would . \\n▁ it 's too late for football , but maybe you 'll consider something else . \\n▁ baseball … or something . '' \\n▁ his voice softened , just fractionally , and i glanced up at him . \\n▁ some of the hard edge was gone from his face and his brows were slightly scrunched , almost like he was concerned . \\n▁ ` ` anything but drugs and alcohol , luc . '' \\n▁ then he dropped his head and the stern mask of adolescent xxunk completely fell off his face . \\n▁ he sniffed a bit and lightly shook his head , while a tender emotion uncharacteristically entered his voice . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd hate to lose another one . '' \\n▁ without looking at me again , he clapped my shoulder roughly and strode off down the hall , barking at a few loitering students to get to class as he did , the stern xxunk snapping right back into place . \\n▁ i found that i could n't move after he left . \\n▁ my vision swam as my eyes watered and i could just barely make out the shape of coach leaving the building . \\n▁ there had been a time when his stern words meant everything to me . \\n▁ he could crush me or lift me with one sentence . \\n▁ he apparently still had that effect on me and i swallowed several times to fight back my overwhelming guilt and remorse . \\n▁ he was wrong about me … they all were , and sports did n't matter much anymore . \\n▁ i exhaled for ten long seconds , closing my eyes . \\n▁ a few more months . \\n▁ that 's all of this that i had to take . \\n▁ sawyer 's eyes locked onto mine the second i stepped foot in the door . \\n▁ her brow drew together in concern and i gave her a vague smile and a quick nod . \\n▁ the bell had rung on my way up the steps and ms . reynolds was just starting class as i walked into the room . \\n▁ just like my first day here , i was disrupting things again . \\n▁ ms . reynolds seemed better equipped to deal with me this time though . \\n▁ she smiled warmly as i approached her . \\n▁ the room was completely silent and i felt the physical heat of all those eyes staring at me . \\n▁ it made me shift uncomfortably as ms . reynolds put a friendly hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ a snigger went up around the room at the contact and i instantly remembered what i 'd said to her , in front of a good chunk of the student body . \\n▁ the words ` totally xxunk ' flashed through my head and my cheeks flushed with warmth , probably turning bright red . \\n▁ the barely contained chuckles got louder , but ms . reynolds ignored them . \\n▁ ` ` oh good , lucas , you 're back . \\n▁ go ahead and take your seat . '' \\n▁ as she seemed to be letting my tardiness slide again , i did n't say anything , only nodded and started my way to sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` oh , luc ? '' \\n▁ her hand touched my arm to stop me and a fresh burst of laughter hit the room . \\n▁ she seemed to notice it this time and scowled at some of the louder people , will among them . \\n▁ ` ` i just wanted to remind you that your appointment with the counselor starts today . '' \\n▁ her eyes lit up at that prospect and her voice was near bubbly when she continued . \\n▁ ` ` the principal is going to let you rejoin the safe and sound club once you complete a six week session . \\n▁ is n't that great ? '' \\n▁ she squeezed my arm for emphasis and i resisted the urge to roll my eyes and sigh . \\n▁ six weeks … great . \\n▁ ` ` uh … yeah . \\n▁ thank you . '' \\n▁ she nodded exuberantly and raised her arm toward the aisle , indicating i should sit . \\n▁ i met eyes with sawyer while a soft chorus of laughs followed me down the row . \\n▁ she grinned and rolled her eyes for me and i chuckled softly . \\n▁ as i was about to pass will , i carefully watched his feet . \\n▁ i did n't need today to be a complete recap of day one . \\n▁ apparently it was n't . \\n▁ will had other ways to embarrass me . \\n▁ right as i walked by , he clutched his desk with both hands and thrust his h * ps up , making the font legs of the desk bang off the floor a couple inches provocatively . \\n▁ he laid his head back and softly moaned , ` ` oh god , ms . reynolds . \\n▁ oh yeah , yeah , fuck … yes , teach me . '' \\n▁ i stumbled a bit on my feet as the entire class , with the exception of sawyer , of course , burst into loud laughing . \\n▁ ms . reynolds had been writing something on the board , carefully transcribing it from the textbook and had apparently missed will 's display . \\n▁ she loudly called for quiet and gave the room stern stares , but did n't say anything directly to will , and i was pretty sure she would have if she 'd heard that . \\n▁ i ' m pretty sure he 'd of gotten detention if she 'd heard that . \\n▁ with flaming cheeks , i sat in my chair and laid my head down on my desk . \\n▁ i wanted to crawl up in a tiny hole and never come out . \\n▁ but had n't i been in a tiny hole for the past two weeks and still been miserable ? \\n▁ i sighed and wished i could take a nap through first period - i 'd love to see lil right now . \\n▁ a soft hand on my arm made me look over at sawyer . \\n▁ i laid my head to the side as quietness enveloped the classroom . \\n▁ she laid her head on her desk and we stared at each other while ms . reynolds went over the current lesson plan . \\n▁ eventually looking at sawyer brought my emotions back to level and i smiled at her . \\n▁ she smiled back and mouthed ` are you okay ? ' \\n▁ i closed my eyes and softly chuckled at her never ending concern for me . \\n▁ reopening them , i nodded at her and mouthed ` just embarrassed ' . \\n▁ she bit her lip and then grinned devilishly . \\n▁ ` ` you should be , '' she whispered , ` ` talking to a teacher like that . '' \\n▁ she raised an eyebrow at me and lightly shook her head . \\n▁ ` dirty boy , ' she mouthed . \\n▁ i bit my lip to not laugh out loud and shaking my head , raised it off my desk . \\n▁ i marveled at sawyer 's odd ability to always make me feel better , whether with silence or a comforting touch , or even a smartass comment . \\n▁ or maybe it was just her very presence . \\n▁ i stretched out my hand to her across the aisle while ms . reynolds went over last week 's homework , homework i 'd only been able to do , thanks to this beautiful godsend beside me . \\n▁ she lightly grabbed my hand and looped our index fingers together . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` anytime , '' she whispered back . \\n▁ sawyer and i both waited around in the back of the room after class , waiting for most , if not all , of the students to leave . \\n▁ ms . reynolds watched us , but said nothing , probably used to how sawyer and i always seemed to linger in class until we were alone . \\n▁ when sawyer could n't wait anymore , her next class being so far away from this one , we headed out to the main doors . \\n▁ sawyer asked about what the coach had wanted and with a heavy sigh i told her . \\n▁ she seemed unsure how to process the conversation . \\n▁ on one hand , he seemed to care about me . \\n▁ on the other hand , he thought i was waist deep in life - altering drugs . \\n▁ finally she shook her head and again encouraged me to tell a teacher about josh , about what really happened . \\n▁ i gave her a faint smile but kept my mouth shut . \\n▁ i was n't xxunk josh , and i did n't much see the point in talking about it anyway . \\n▁ just like the coach , people 's minds were already decided . \\n▁ she twisted her lips as we parted ways , seeming to understand where my head was at . \\n▁ i suppose she 'd handle all of this differently . \\n▁ well , maybe not . \\n▁ it 's much easier to give advice than follow it . \\n▁ history went pretty smoothly , with only a handful of stares and whispers , usually followed by light laughter . \\n▁ i kept my head down and did my best to ignore it all . \\n▁ thanks to sawyer 's diligence in keeping me caught up , i got back into the swing of things smoothly , and if mr . davis was startled by my actual presence in the room after being absent for so long , he did n't show it . \\n▁ in fact , the only comments i got were from eliza , who asked if my girlfriend was going to stop asking her for the assignments , since i was back at school . \\n▁ i stared at her blankly and stupidly nodded as i processed that . \\n▁ i never did find out how sawyer managed to get all the work from all of my classes , even the ones we did n't share . \\n▁ i must have mentioned eliza to her at some point and she 'd gone out of her way to talk to the woman . \\n▁ pretty impressive . \\n▁ i wondered who she 'd talked with in astronomy ? \\n▁ i asked her about it when we met up next period and she only smiled and shrugged it off , like it was no big deal . \\n▁ she explained that she 'd heard eliza talking about me in computer lab one day and had deduced that we had history together . \\n▁ she had choir with one of the cheerleaders in astronomy and had talked her into handing over her notes , and she 'd met with my art teacher after choir , since the buildings were right next to each other . \\n▁ i shook my head at her and smiled , amazed at the lengths she took to help me , and also a little amazed that she 'd found students in this school that would help her , knowing full well they were really helping me . \\n▁ we were whispering back and forth to each other about it during philosophy when mr . varner came down the aisle and stopped right in front of my desk . \\n▁ a soft giggle went up around the room and i remembered the gossip that had floated around about the three of us . \\n▁ staring up at his narrowed eyes , i also remembered him helping my drug - riddled body out of the gym and into the main building , where he 'd called my mom , freaking her out with his vague responses . \\n▁ he 'd had a close up view of my high , and he had n't been too thrilled about it . \\n▁ he looked even less thrilled as he scowled down at me now . \\n▁ ` ` something you 'd like to share with the class , lucas ? '' \\n▁ his voice was low and while not threatening in any way , it was n't friendly either . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` no , mr . varner . '' \\n▁ he crossed his arms over his chest and half smiled . \\n▁ i heard a soft sigh from a student beside me and i had to stop myself from rolling my eyes . \\n▁ yes , he was attractive … but he was also an a * * hole . \\n▁ i did n't understand why the girls around here could be so quick to overlook that fact . \\n▁ ` ` are you sure ? \\n▁ would n't you like to enlighten us on how you spent your … break ? '' \\n▁ the room quieted down and i heard the rustle of people turning in their seats . \\n▁ i did n't remove my eyes from the teacher , but i imagined that everybody had just shifted to watch this . \\n▁ i bit my lip and lightly shook my head , hoping he 'd drop it before i either yelled something at him or burst into tears , and really , with how my morning was going , i could do either . \\n▁ he leaned in over my desk and i involuntarily leaned back . \\n▁ ` ` next time you want to get high … you do it on someone else 's watch . '' \\n▁ he glanced over at sawyer before shifting his eyes back to me . \\n▁ ` ` now both of you - be quiet . '' \\n▁ and with that , he stood straight and walked back to the front of the room . \\n▁ i swallowed and looked around . \\n▁ sure enough , most people were turned to face me , some with open - mouthed , shocked faces and some with barely contained smirks . \\n▁ one by one they followed mr . varner , and turned in their seats . \\n▁ my cheeks felt hot to the touch as his words flashed through me . \\n▁ so , no ` your life is better without drugs ' speech from mr . varner then . \\n▁ nope , just an ' i know you 're a messed up kid , who is just going to do it anyway , so go do it far away from me so i do n't have to pick up the pieces of your worthless life ' comment . \\n▁ odd point of view for a philosophy teacher to have . \\n▁ as i stared down at my desk , i started to think that maybe mr . varner should have picked a different major in college . \\n▁ ` ` well , that was uncalled for , '' sawyer muttered , as we huddled around her locker during break . \\n▁ i looked over at her while she put some books away and got others out , stuffing them in her bag . \\n▁ i adjusted my heavy backpack on my shoulder as i leaned against a cool , metal locker with my other one . \\n▁ i never used mine . \\n▁ i would n't even come near these lockers if sawyer did n't want to use lil 's … hers . \\n▁ i generally avoided looking when she opened it , like somehow , a part of lil had gotten trapped in there when she 'd died , and every time the door was opened , a bit of her light shone and i could n't bear to watch . \\n▁ ridiculous ? \\n▁ yes , i know , but that 's the feeling it gave me . \\n▁ today though , i stared at the lifeless thing while sawyer adjusted some stuff inside it , just hoping for a spark of lil to fill me . \\n▁ i had n't dreamt of her since our last … encounter . \\n▁ since that had kind of been an intense dream , and it had been cut off so abruptly … and i was just having a crappy kind of day , i really wanted to see lil again . \\n▁ i wanted to see if she was okay , if we were okay . \\n▁ god , now i really do sound insane . \\n▁ i want to dream about my dead girlfriend again , so i can make sure she was n't freaked out by the almost sex we had … in a dream . \\n▁ all of it was in my head . \\n▁ still , she felt as real as anything else . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ sawyer 's voice broke me from my bizarre thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ oh , mr . varner , right . '' \\n▁ i pushed myself away from the lockers and watched some of the kids walk down the hall , most staring at me , some whispering , some just plain laughing , and even one or two scowling . \\n▁ i turned back to watch sawyer close her locker . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , he 's just an a * * hole . '' \\n▁ she frowned and then grinned . \\n▁ ` ` odd that he teaches philosophy , right ? '' \\n▁ i laughed and slung an arm around her shoulders , pulling her tight to me . \\n▁ ` ` what 's odd is how alike you and i are sometimes . '' \\n▁ she frowned at me when she looked up at my face , but then she laughed with me . \\n▁ i dropped my arm from around her shoulders , still reluctant to be over friendly with her around so many gossiping eyes , even though that was pretty pointless by now , and they 'd all make up whatever stories they wanted to anyway . \\n▁ i mean , just this morning , had n't eliza called her my girlfriend ? \\n▁ i frowned as i realized that i never corrected her on that . \\n▁ quickly slipping my grin back on , i started walking down the hall with sawyer . \\n▁ and standing close to each other , but never touching , we made our way to our next class . \\n▁ math . \\n▁ it 's a tricky subject to try and learn on your own , even if you 're pretty good at it . \\n▁ and i. . . \\n▁ struggle with it . \\n▁ mentally planning to ditch this class next semester , i spent the whole of the hour with my head darting from the board to my textbook to my paper , in an odd , haphazard triangle pattern . \\n▁ i practically chewed through my pencil as i tried to grasp what the bloody hell she was talking about . \\n▁ when it came to free study time at the end of class , mrs . chambers came over to her ` ` favorite '' student and attempted to help me catch up . \\n▁ i was immensely grateful that she cared more about her beloved subject , than the rumor mill running through these walls . \\n▁ i think i could have been lying in a pile of my own alcohol - induced vomit , and she 'd still try and help me if i showed just the tiniest bit of interest in mathematics . \\n▁ she had definitely chosen the right major . \\n▁ while i knew passing the class with a b would be a lofty goal , i felt much better about the situation once the period was over . \\n▁ i felt even better about it as i shared my sandwich in the car with sawyer . \\n▁ she got a serious case of the giggles as she described my face to me when i 'd been trying to grasp algorithms . \\n▁ i tried to sneer at her , but ended up bursting out with laughter too . \\n▁ feeling a need for the cathartic release , i brought up mr . varner chewing me out , coach trapping me in the hall and will 's sexual display during class . \\n▁ with tears streaming down her face , she lost nearly all control when i re - performed will 's shining moment for her . \\n▁ ` ` oh , yes , yes … fuck , teach me . '' \\n▁ i started laughing uncontrollably and we both settled in for a long , happy release . \\n▁ eventually , we calmed down and rested back in her bucket seats , looking over at each other . \\n▁ we 'd drifted close in our gaiety , and our shoulders touched between the gap created by her center console , our heads resting on the very edge of the xxunk , towards each other . \\n▁ trying to even our breaths , but still smiling softly , we stared at each other . \\n▁ the familiar comfort washed into me as i lost myself in her gray depths . \\n▁ a similar look passed over her and i wanted to stay in this car for eternity . \\n▁ she leaned forward and a dark lock of hair fell over her eye . \\n▁ without thinking about it , i reached up and tucked it behind her ear . \\n▁ then i found myself running my fingers back through her hair before bringing my palm up to cup her cool cheek . \\n▁ then my thumb started stroking that cheek . \\n▁ even though the car was slightly chilly , i felt warmth spread in me as we touched . \\n▁ i watched her breath catch and her eyes flick over my face . \\n▁ my eyes flicked over hers , settling on her lips . \\n▁ subconsciously , i found myself leaning forward . \\n▁ ` ` luc … we 're gon na be late , '' she whispered , just moments before we brushed together . \\n▁ startled back to reality , i dropped my hand from her skin and pulled back . \\n▁ ` ` right . '' \\n▁ i looked down and then peeked up at her from under my brow . \\n▁ she was chewing her lip . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , '' i muttered . \\n▁ she gave me a vague smile and turning , opened her car door . \\n▁ i shut my eyes at my stupid lack of self control , and with a heavy exhale , opened mine . \\n▁ she did n't say anything as she waited for me at the front of her car , just played with the sleeves of my jacket and bit her lip . \\n▁ i felt the need to say something , but did n't know what to say , so i gave her a half smile and nodded my head towards school . \\n▁ she fell in beside me and was quiet on the way to our next respective classes . \\n▁ her head was down and her dark hair covered her expression . \\n▁ i wanted to stop her and sweep that hair back from her face so i could see what she was thinking . \\n▁ i wanted to tell her that i was sorry , yet again , for getting near the borderline of our friendship . \\n▁ and an odd , tiny speck of me … wanted to kiss her , wanted to find comfort in those lips , just like i found comfort in her voice and her laugh … and her eyes . \\n▁ i would n't do that though . \\n▁ that would be selfish . \\n▁ not if she was interested in more . \\n▁ not when my heart still belonged to lil … lost in those thoughts , i startled when sawyer 's hand caught my elbow and stopped me . \\n▁ i looked up and noticed that we were at our crossroads , left for me to get to astronomy and right for her to get to computer lab . \\n▁ i had n't even noticed the journey . \\n▁ i looked over at her and took in the serious expression on her face . \\n▁ i swallowed , thinking she was finally going to tell me she could n't handle being my friend anymore , not when i constantly pulled her close and pushed her away . \\n▁ my stomach hurt as i waited for her rejection . \\n▁ she narrowed her eyes and scrunched her brow to a sharp point . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you dare … start something with josh . \\n▁ just let it go , lucas . '' \\n▁ her eyes bored into me , demanding and yet pleading at the same time . \\n▁ i relaxed when i realized she was n't going to toss me aside , and then a slow fire started burning in me . \\n▁ i 'd nearly forgotten that i 'd have this class with josh . \\n▁ i 'd nearly forgotten that i 'd have to endure sitting in a room with him for an hour , not able to do anything about the mix of rage and sadness swirling within me . \\n▁ sawyer 's eyes narrowed even more as she took in my expression . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m serious , lucas . '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` he 's not worth you getting kicked out of here . \\n▁ do n't give him what he wants . '' \\n▁ i blinked and took a step back . \\n▁ the anger started to fade from me as i realized that she was right . \\n▁ if i let my emotions take control and got myself kicked out of here , he 'd have exactly what he 'd hoped for with his stupid little stunt . \\n▁ he 'd win . \\n▁ while i was sure it was n't really a game to either of us , i was n't about to give him the satisfaction of running me off . \\n▁ no , if i had to deal with him for the rest of the year , then he 'd just have to deal with me too . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't touch him , sawyer … i promise . '' \\n▁ her stance relaxed , along with her face . \\n▁ she searched me for a sign of some lie to my words and i gave her a wry smile . \\n▁ ` ` i promise , okay . '' \\n▁ she bit her lip again and nodded . \\n▁ a small laugh escaped me . \\n▁ ` ` besides , i think i 'll let you fight all my battles for me . '' \\n▁ she grinned and i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` you hit better than me anyway . '' \\n▁ she laughed and gave me a quick hug before darting off to her class . \\n▁ i smiled , watching her leave and then frowned as i turned to the path that led me to my next encounter with darren 's little brother . \\n▁ as i walked along that concrete road , i remembered back to walking this exact path last year with darren . \\n▁ that had unknowingly been such a simpler time . \\n▁ back then , our biggest dilemma had been the approaching teenage milestone known as junior prom . \\n▁ ` ` $ 300 bucks , luc . \\n▁ that 's how much this stupid dance is gon na cost me … $ 300 bucks . '' \\n▁ darren shook his head at me in my memory and frowned at his money woes . \\n▁ i grinned over at him . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but sammy will be endlessly grateful to you for showing up in the limo she wants . '' \\n▁ he gave me a devilish grin as we walked , pausing a fraction of a second to wave at a group of friends that we strolled by . \\n▁ ` ` dude , sammy is ` grateful ' to me five times a week … and it does n't cost me $ 300 bucks . '' \\n▁ i stopped walking and he looked back at me . \\n▁ ` ` five times a week ? '' \\n▁ he grinned and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` at least . \\n▁ sometimes more if her parents leave for the weekend . '' \\n▁ he shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` what can i say - my girl 's a horny freak . '' \\n▁ i grinned at the words i knew sammy would soundly smack him for , if she ever heard them repeated . \\n▁ i started walking beside him again , shaking my head . \\n▁ he looked over at me thoughtfully . \\n▁ ` ` you and lil still have n't … '' i looked over at him and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` no , we 're … waiting . \\n▁ the moment has just never been right … '' i shrugged and looked forward , letting the sentence die . \\n▁ lil and i had talked about it several times , but somehow , neither one of us felt like it was just the right time . \\n▁ we were waiting for the ` ` perfect '' time . \\n▁ darren laughed beside me . \\n▁ ` ` well , do n't wait too long or something 's gon na come up and snatch that hottie away from you . \\n▁ besides , it 's only sex , lucas . \\n▁ i think you guys are making it out to be a much bigger deal than it really is . '' \\n▁ i scowled as we walked under the overhang of the science building , darren nodding a greeting to another group of friends passing by us . \\n▁ i switched my frown to a sly smile as i glanced over at him . \\n▁ ` ` says the man who waited two years to be with his … freak . '' \\n▁ darren 's face clouded up as he glared over at me . \\n▁ i knew he and sammy had a different situation than lil and me . \\n▁ i mean , they were only fourteen when they got together , but it was fun to tease him about it , especially if he was going to tease me . \\n▁ darren was about to respond to my jibe when a set of arms slung over his shoulder and mine . \\n▁ ` ` who 's a freak ? '' \\n▁ i looked over behind me at josh hanging off of us , his face glowing with adoration for his big brother . \\n▁ ` ` your future sister - in - law , '' i playfully told him . \\n▁ darren smacked me in the chest as josh suddenly gripped both of his shoulders , shaking him gently . \\n▁ ` ` really ? \\n▁ like kinky - freaky ? \\n▁ lucky bastard , shelly will only let me feel her up . '' \\n▁ darren grinned at josh , xxunk his hair , and slinging an arm over his shoulder . \\n▁ he pointed at me . \\n▁ ` ` well , you 're further than , lucas , '' he xxunk . \\n▁ they 'd both laughed heartily at me then , while i 'd smacked darren on the chest and told him where he could shove it . \\n▁ as i passed under the overhang on the considerably darker , present tense science building , i clearly remembered darren and josh 's laughing faces . \\n▁ the way their eyes had sparkled with life and joy , the way they 'd had an arm around each other , supporting each other . \\n▁ best friends in a way darren and i never would be . \\n▁ it tore me that the jovial face i 'd seen on josh then , was all but lost now . \\n▁ sadness for that faded childhood leeched away my remaining spikes of anger and i felt only melancholy as i opened the door to class . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i took a deep breath and closed my eyes for a second before making the attempt . \\n▁ his entire body stiffened as i approached him , and i watched his sneer twist into anger . \\n▁ he obviously did not want me close to him and probably , really did not want me talking to him . \\n▁ i slowly let out my deep breath and stopped at the edge of his desk . \\n▁ randy twisted from the seat in front of josh to watch , his eyes nervous . \\n▁ the teacher , mr . thomson , was staring out the window , waiting for the bell to ring and the rest of the students to filter into class , completely oblivious to the drama and tension building up inside the room . \\n▁ the other students were not . \\n▁ i felt eyes turning to me and heard chairs squeaking as bodies shifted in them , anxious for a fight . \\n▁ i was n't going to give them one . \\n▁ that was n't my desire anymore . \\n▁ slowly i began , cautious of josh 's stormy face and excitable temper . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to start something with you , josh , i just want to talk . '' \\n▁ josh 's eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` i have nothing to say to you . '' \\n▁ i sighed . \\n▁ ` ` come on , stop this already . \\n▁ you made me look stupid , alright . \\n▁ you got me f * * ked up and almost kicked out of here . '' \\n▁ i lifted my shoulders and hands in an exasperated expression . \\n▁ ` ` is n't that enough ? '' \\n▁ he stood by his desk and i felt the tension in the room triple . \\n▁ he was shorter than me , by a lot , but his confidence that he could kick my ass was evident in every move he made . \\n▁ his lips twisted into a small grin . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what you 're talking about , luc . '' \\n▁ he eyed me up and down contemptuously . \\n▁ ` ` you made your own bad choices … like always . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes at the clear insinuation of that night . \\n▁ ` ` josh , we used to be friends . \\n▁ come on , man … '' i opened my eyes as fingertips pushed me back . \\n▁ josh 's face looked even xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` i used to be a lot of things , luc . '' \\n▁ his voice rose and he took a step towards me , until we were toe to toe . \\n▁ ` ` a brother … a best friend . '' \\n▁ his finger jabbed me harshly in the chest and his voice went even higher . \\n▁ ` ` you took all of that away from me ! \\n▁ you ! \\n▁ so do n't give me the ` come on ' crap ! '' \\n▁ at this point , mr . thomson roused from his near trance , finally noticing that a storm was brewing in his room . \\n▁ he stood up and quickly raced over to josh and me . \\n▁ i was so twisted with emotion over josh 's words that i had n't backed away from him and mr . thomson had to use his arms to literally wedge us apart . \\n▁ we both looked over to his annoyed face when he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` enough ! \\n▁ break it off or you 'll both get detention ! '' \\n▁ he pushed me away from where i was still standing in a dazed funk . \\n▁ ` ` sit down , lucas ! '' \\n▁ he turned me and shoved me towards my desk . \\n▁ stumbling a bit , i finally started moving on my own . \\n▁ i heard him turn around and bark at josh , ` ` you too ! '' \\n▁ the bell rang , right as i sat down , and with a quick glance at a glaring josh , i turned my attention back to mr . thomson , his eyes narrowed and flicking between the two of us . \\n▁ ` ` there will be no fighting in my classroom ! \\n▁ understand ! '' \\n▁ i reluctantly nodded and looked over at josh who was doing the same . \\n▁ the tension in the air started to dissolve and a few students around me let out held breaths . \\n▁ a few snickered and a couple started placing odds on an after school knockout . \\n▁ from what i could make out , the odds were not in my favor . \\n▁ i clenched my jaw and tried to let my body relax . \\n▁ i do n't know why i 'd even tried that . \\n▁ there was no reasoning with josh , not with how much he hated me . \\n▁ closing my eyes , i listened to mr . thomson start class and focused only on relaxing and breathing . \\n▁ i 'd tried . \\n▁ i 'd tried to let go of my own anger and salvage some of josh and i 's friendship . \\n▁ but i 'd failed . \\n▁ i 'd failed , and now i had to let him go . \\n▁ i would n't try talking to him again . \\n▁ i 'd just have to ignore any more attempts he made to engage me . \\n▁ in fact , i 'd just ignore any detrimental thing that he did to me . \\n▁ even if he did somehow manage to kick my ass , all he would get from me was silent acceptance . \\n▁ because , while i may not agree with josh 's methods , i did sort of understand his anger ; i 'd be angry too , if i thought josh had gotten drunk and killed them all . \\n▁ that would tear me inside , and i 'd probably never forgive him either . \\n▁ and while i do n't think i 'd ever go to josh 's extremes … i hated myself enough that i could sympathize with josh wanting to destroy me . \\n▁ the rest of class went by with the traditional stares and whispers . \\n▁ for the first half of class , there were some odd tension - filled glances among the students in the space between josh and me . \\n▁ they seemed to believe that we were going to launch at each other right in the middle of mr . thomson 's speech on the mysteries of black holes . \\n▁ i kept my head straight and focused on listening to the teacher and eventually people started to relax , realizing nothing was going to happen . \\n▁ i tried to focus on the teacher , but all i heard in my ears was josh 's searing words , ` you took all of that away from me ! \\n▁ you ! ' \\n▁ i knew he was right . \\n▁ i knew that no matter if i was drunk or not , he was right . \\n▁ i was the one driving that night . \\n▁ i had done it … me , and darren was gone because of it . \\n▁ josh would never see past that and whatever semblance of friendship we had , was gone . \\n▁ i sighed as i thought of how disappointed darren would be about that . \\n▁ i ' m sure he 'd prefer it if josh and i had bonded even tighter over his death , leaning on each other for support and comfort . \\n▁ but this was no disney movie , and what josh wanted from me was n't comfort - he wanted vengeance . \\n▁ it saddened me to let that friendship go , he really was all i had left of darren , but i could n't hold onto someone who did n't want me , someone who actively hated me . \\n▁ my letting him go , would be the best solution for both of us . \\n▁ it would be hard to let his anger and torments slide away from me without reacting , but even with all he 'd done so far , i had n't hit him yet , and really , i think him drugging me was the worst he could do . \\n▁ i 'd just have to be more careful with my stuff around him … or his helpers . \\n▁ with a nasty glare at me after class , josh was forcefully dragged out of the room by randy , who looked at me with an odd , almost apologetic face . \\n▁ i had no idea why . \\n▁ surely he 'd been more than happy to carry out josh 's orders and spike my water . \\n▁ it 's not like he 'd been warm towards me at all this year . \\n▁ by the time i shuffled out the door , both of them were gone and i breathed in deeply , letting the crispness in the air clear my thoughts . \\n▁ i walked with my head down and concentrated on placing one foot in front of the other ; that was enough to concentrate on for now . \\n▁ i heard a vague cacophony of whispers as i walked along and felt more than a few eyes , but i did my best to not worry about them . \\n▁ one more class and i 'd be able to see sawyer again and then this feeling of discord would lift from me . \\n▁ i walked into art class and immediately smiled as mrs . xxunk turned at my entrance and exclaimed , ` ` welcome back , tom ! '' \\n▁ i shook my head and made my way to my seat , not feeling the need to correct her . \\n▁ i grinned as i thought that maybe i 'd just change my name and be this elusive ` tom ' from now on . \\n▁ a small chuckle escaped me when i realized how my name would fit in so nicely with sawyer 's . \\n▁ we were connected on so many surprising levels . \\n▁ a couple of intensely working students looked up at me upon hearing my laughter . \\n▁ they blinked and seemed surprised to see my seat occupied , and then went back to whatever they were working on . \\n▁ i smiled softly and let the sounds of busy people relax my mood . \\n▁ light scratches on paper , the faint smell of oil paints and the gentle murmurings of mrs . xxunk as she walked throughout the room , checking the student 's progress , eased the tension of the last class away from me . \\n▁ i took a deep breath and prepared to work on my latest version of my saving grace , sawyer . \\n▁ mrs . xxunk never commented on the fact that all of my subjects , in whatever medium she was teaching us , were all a dark haired girl with pale gray eyes . \\n▁ i was n't even sure she had made the connection , as she was more interested in nurturing our techniques than what we chose to paint . \\n▁ art was the one class that i had n't had any real homework in for sawyer to collect - which was a good thing , since i 'd have been really embarrassed handing sawyer pieces of her own image to turn in for me , and nothing else moved me enough to paint it . \\n▁ the teacher had only told sawyer that i could work on one project while i was gone , and hand it in when i got back . \\n▁ i dug through my backpack until i found the charcoal sketched version of her that i had created during my hiatus . \\n▁ i unfolded the paper and stretched it out on my easel to make some finishing touches before i turned it in . \\n▁ it was my favorite piece of her , maybe because of the style , or maybe because i 'd had so much time to work on it . \\n▁ during my more lucid moments , i 'd spent hours going over the tiny details of her face , details i loved : the delicate bridge of her nose , the tiny freckle right beside her left eye , the one dimple in her cheek that she 'd only get when she was giving me a wry half - smile , the look in her eye when i knew she was worrying about me , the way her upper lip formed the perfect , double arch of a heart … a face leaning down next to me startled me from my work and i glanced over at the teacher leaning in , inspecting my drawing . \\n▁ ` ` is this what you did while you were gone , tom ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes … and it 's lucas , mrs . xxunk . '' \\n▁ i really should n't let her call me the wrong name forever , as nice as the alter - ego was . \\n▁ she glanced at me and frowned a bit as she looked over my features . \\n▁ ` ` oh , right , of course . '' \\n▁ she looked over my drawing again and sighed , a smile coming to her lips . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a beautiful piece , lucas . \\n▁ your strokes are delicate and intricate , quite an accomplishment with charcoal . \\n▁ you really are quite talented . '' \\n▁ she straightened and patted my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i can see you put a lot of work into this . \\n▁ it 's very good . \\n▁ nice job , tom … lucas . '' \\n▁ i grinned ear to ear as she walked away , happy that my picture had pleased her . \\n▁ i stared at sawyer 's face for long moments , almost sorry to let go of it . \\n▁ oh well , i 'd get it back soon and i did need the grade . \\n▁ i sighed and wrote my name on the back , mentally preparing myself to let yet another thing i cared about go . \\n▁ i exhaled a happy sigh when school finally let out for the day . \\n▁ i 'd done it . \\n▁ i 'd survived what was essentially another first day of school . \\n▁ it had been emotional and embarrassing , frustrating and definitely difficult , but now it was over and none of that mattered . \\n▁ now i got to see sawyer , and that was enough to put a spring in my step as i exited the classroom . \\n▁ i stumbled on that step as i saw sawyer in what looked like a heated conversation outside of the choir room . \\n▁ she appeared to be having intense words with … brittany . \\n▁ i hastily made my way across the space between the two buildings , hoping i could stop whatever they were arguing about . \\n▁ brittany was surrounded by her legion of followers , most girls i 'd known for years and hung out with on several occasions . \\n▁ they noticed me coming and patted brittany on the shoulder . \\n▁ she broke off on her comment to sawyer and looked up at me , her brown eyes narrowing . \\n▁ her shoulders straightened and she swept her almost - blonde hair back over her shoulder . \\n▁ her face twisted into a cruel sneer and i wondered how i 'd ever found her attractive . \\n▁ she took a step toward me , casually shoving sawyer 's shoulder back with her other . \\n▁ sawyer 's eyes flicked to mine and her jaw clenched , her fists in tight balls . \\n▁ she looked like she wanted to slug brittany , although her eyes looked like she wanted to start sobbing . \\n▁ my heart seized at the hurt i saw in her face and i hoped whatever had started this … had n't been because of me . \\n▁ she suffered enough because of me . \\n▁ brittany took a step up to me , her sneer turning to a knowing smirk . \\n▁ ` ` back for more , lucas ? \\n▁ i ' ve already told you ` no ' a dozen times . \\n▁ you really need to get over me . '' \\n▁ her voice dropped seductively and i got the feeling that that really was n't what she was saying at all . \\n▁ i got the feeling that if i secretly told her to meet me in my bedroom tonight … she would . \\n▁ my face darkening , i took a step over to sawyer and pulled her into me . \\n▁ sawyer tried to step back , but i held her tight . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay , '' i whispered as i looked down at her , momentarily ignoring brittany and her laughing group of friends . \\n▁ sawyer bit her lip and nodded that she was , but her eyes watered drastically . \\n▁ a hand reached out and pushed my shoulder . \\n▁ my head snapped back to brittany , right as she stepped up to me , practically in my face . \\n▁ brittany did n't like being ignored . \\n▁ ` ` i was talking to you xxunk … or are you just too high to notice ? '' \\n▁ i resisted the urge to smack the smug look from her face . \\n▁ knowing brittany , she 'd probably like that . \\n▁ ` ` what did you say to her ? '' \\n▁ i said through clenched teeth , trying desperately to hold in my ever shifting emotions . \\n▁ ` ` your white trash ? '' \\n▁ she shrugged , like she really could n't care less about the argument they 'd been having . \\n▁ ` ` we were just going over your extracurricular activities . '' \\n▁ she glanced at sawyer and her grin turned outrageously cocky . \\n▁ she was loving this . \\n▁ i closed my eyes , wanting to walk away , wanting to pull sawyer out of this school and away from these people . \\n▁ ` ` what are you talking about ? '' \\n▁ i muttered instead . \\n▁ she leaned in close to me , her lips practically on my ear . \\n▁ i cringed away from her unintentionally when she spoke in a husky voice . \\n▁ ` ` i only apologized that her boyfriend was a no good man whore . '' \\n▁ her eyes flicked down my body seductively and contemptuously . \\n▁ ` ` but what can you expect from a drugged out alcoholic ? '' \\n▁ sawyer beside me went bright red and her mouth opened in clear protest . \\n▁ ` ` he is not a - '' only thinking about getting away from brittany , and her odd mixed signals , i cut sawyer off … and said something really , really stupid . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not her boyfriend , brittany . \\n▁ leave her alone . '' \\n▁ with those words , i grabbed a suddenly pale looking sawyer 's hand and dragged her away from the group . \\n▁ from behind me , i heard brittany loudly exclaim , ` ` oh god , he 's f * * king her but he does n't even want her ! '' \\n▁ then even louder i heard her yell , ` ` sorry , white trash ! \\n▁ i guess i had nothing to apologize for ! '' \\n▁ i exhaled slowly and clenched sawyer 's hand in mine . \\n▁ i cursed under my breath at saying something so stupid to brittany . \\n▁ true , there was nothing false about the statement , but , of all the things brittany had said , that was the worst one for me to object to . \\n▁ by picking that statement to deny , i 'd just given brittany an arsenal of torture to spout at sawyer . \\n▁ in one sentence , i 'd pretty much confirmed everything else she 'd said about me and downplayed the importance of sawyer in my life . \\n▁ god , i ' m an idiot . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , '' i muttered , as sawyer hurried beside me to keep up with my fast pace . \\n▁ i glanced over at her and saw that her eyes were n't as watery , but still seemed sad . \\n▁ the rest of her face had returned to her normal composure and i was sure that no one but me would even notice the faint unhappiness in her eyes . \\n▁ i slowed my pace and she looked over at me . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer … i ' m sorry about what i - '' she shook her head and cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't say anything that is n't true . '' \\n▁ i stopped walking and she stopped with me , searching my eyes , like she was looking for some clue about how i really felt about her . \\n▁ i wished i could explain it , wished i could tell her that she was the one that made me light up in a way that made my mom smile , that she was the one that i painted in every art class , that she was home to me . \\n▁ i could n't say any of that though , not without confusing her even more . \\n▁ ` ` i should n't have said it like that … especially to someone like brittany . \\n▁ it came off like i do n't care about you at all and that 's not true . '' \\n▁ i sighed heavily and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i feel like i just made things worse for you . '' \\n▁ her hand came up to brush my cheek and she swallowed . \\n▁ ` ` it 's fine , lucas . \\n▁ they just … '' she sighed and looked away , dropping her hand . \\n▁ ` ` they what , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ she turned back and her eyes stared at my shoes . \\n▁ ` ` she 's teased me with the whole ` white trash ' thing since the first day , when i ran into her in the parking lot . '' \\n▁ she sighed and looked up to my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i was hiding out in the bathroom that day , because she hounded me all the way to the building about my hand - me - down clothes and cheap - ass book bag . \\n▁ she thought it was hilarious that i did n't have a jacket when it was pouring and … '' she looked out over the campus to where we 'd left brittany and her wannabes , ` ` when she saw me wearing your jacket later that day … she just … picked up her teasing a touch more . '' \\n▁ i opened my mouth , surprised at her revelation and looked back with sawyer . \\n▁ i had the sudden desire to run back there and tell that bitch that i never cared about her and never would , so she was the one that should just get over it … whatever the hell it was to her . \\n▁ sawyer 's words brought me back to her though . \\n▁ ` ` it does n't matter , luc . \\n▁ it may bother me sometimes , the teasing and xxunk , but , '' she sniffed and straightened her shoulders , ` ` i know my family struggles with money and stuff . \\n▁ they do the best they can for me . '' \\n▁ she shook her head , and a wisdom seldom seen in a person her age crept into her voice . \\n▁ ` ` i know what 's important … and what 's not , and brittany and her cronies … are n't . '' \\n▁ her face hardened into that serious mask that she could sometimes slip into . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't let someone like that destroy my life . '' \\n▁ she glanced around the school grounds with only her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` all of this … it 's only temporary , luc . '' \\n▁ she looked at me pointedly . \\n▁ ` ` remember that . '' \\n▁ i nodded and then shook my head at her , disbelieving . \\n▁ most kids , even me sometimes , could n't get past how high school could seem like the be - all and end - all of our young existence . \\n▁ ` ` how old are you ? '' \\n▁ i muttered . \\n▁ she giggled , like the schoolgirl she really was , and started walking towards the main building again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m seventeen , lucas … eighteen in january , '' she added with a grin . \\n▁ i threw an arm around her shoulders as i matched her pace . \\n▁ ` ` wow , i ' m hangin ' with an older woman . '' \\n▁ i grinned down at her . \\n▁ ` ` i think i got some of those cool points back . '' \\n▁ she laughed genuinely and slung an arm around my waist . \\n▁ i let the tension of our conversation , and the xxunk with brittany , die as her comfort seeped into me . \\n▁ she sighed happily and looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` hey , good job by the way . '' \\n▁ confused , i scrunched my brow and looked down at her . \\n▁ ` ` huh ? '' \\n▁ she smiled as we approached the door to the main building , where the safe and sound club met . \\n▁ i pulled open the door for us while she gingerly answered . \\n▁ ` ` well , you 're not bruised or bleeding , so i ' m taking it that you did what i asked and left josh alone . '' \\n▁ her face beamed up at me as she stepped through the door . \\n▁ i frowned as i followed her . \\n▁ ` ` maybe i just won the fight . '' \\n▁ i raised an eyebrow at her and she giggled again . \\n▁ ` ` well , you were n't carted off the campus , so i ' m assuming that you did n't haul off and hit him . '' \\n▁ i laughed and then shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i said i 'd stay away … i did . '' \\n▁ i did n't mention that i 'd tried to have an actual conversation with him . \\n▁ it had n't gone well anyway , so , not much to tell . \\n▁ she snuggled back into my side as we walked through the empty halls . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad , luc . '' \\n▁ she rested her head against me and i smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to see you in anymore trouble . '' \\n▁ i rested my cheek on her head . \\n▁ ` ` me either , '' i muttered . \\n▁ we came to the classroom door and i pulled it open , preparing to go in with her . \\n▁ she put a hand on my chest and looked at me quizzically . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you have to get to your … thing ? '' \\n▁ confused , i was about to ask her what she was talking about when it suddenly hit me . \\n▁ oh , damn it … the counselor . \\n▁ with everything that had happened today , i 'd completely forgotten about that hell waiting for me . \\n▁ i frowned as i realized that we 'd be parting ways now . \\n▁ she brought her hand up to my cheek , stroking it with the back of her knuckle . \\n▁ ` ` hey , smile . \\n▁ it wo n't be so bad . '' \\n▁ she dropped her hand and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you 'll even like it ? '' \\n▁ i gave her a ` yeah right ' face and sighed , staring longingly at the purity club door . \\n▁ the thought that i was longing to be at a purity club meeting made me chuckle softly , and with a shake of my head , i told her goodbye and gave her a swift hug before she entered the classroom without me . \\n▁ staring at the closed door , i waited for ten long seconds before turning around and heading for the office … where my new personal hell was waiting for me . \\n▁ i knocked softly on the closed , opaque door with the word ` ` counselor '' in rub - on , black letters across it . \\n▁ this was technically the guidance counselor 's office , where she set up shop to help seniors apply to colleges , juniors put together a senior year with the most free periods , and freshman and sophomores find a way to weasel out of gym and typing . \\n▁ the ` grief ' counselor that they 'd brought in this year full time , courtesy of me , was sharing the office with her . \\n▁ i suppose this arrangement was quite handy for the custodians , since technically , they did n't have to resign the door . \\n▁ i waited a couple seconds , hoping she had n't heard me and i could leave , knowing that i 'd tried . \\n▁ no such luck . \\n▁ just as i was turning to dash away , to wait in the hallway for sawyer , a soft voice answered me . \\n▁ ` ` come on in , lucas . '' \\n▁ i cringed ; both that she 'd heard me , and that she knew it was me out here . \\n▁ with a heavy sigh , i opened the door and stepped inside . \\n▁ i ' m sure it was my imagination , but the temperature seemed to drop a few degrees once i passed through the doorframe . \\n▁ i closed the door behind me and felt the echo vibrate morosely throughout the room . \\n▁ rolling my eyes at my own dramatics , i took a step into the room and looked around at my ` ` home away from home '' for the next six weeks . \\n▁ i 'd been to the counselor 's office a few times , but that was when the guidance counselor had it to herself . \\n▁ i internally smiled at the school 's attempt to casually split a room into two . \\n▁ their solution to the problem was an obtrusive line of two six foot tall lateral file cabinets in a straight line down the center of the room . \\n▁ the drawers faced out into the guidance counselor 's ` ` area '' , with her desk shoved haphazardly in the corner . \\n▁ she had a chair for visitors and a sturdy case full of thick , xxunk books , and that was about it . \\n▁ i bet she loved having her personal work space halved like that . \\n▁ the backside of the file cabinets was equally as cramped , but an attempt was being made to create a soothing work space . \\n▁ the grief counselor 's desk was specifically made for corners and sculpted nicely into the space it was given . \\n▁ expecting a chaise lounge or couch in front of it , i was a little surprised to see a standard office chair for the ` ` client 's '' seat . \\n▁ the rest of the room was filled with an almost spa - like ambiance : candles , soothing pictures of waterfalls and rock gardens , light jazz playing softly . \\n▁ a japanese - like accordion room separator was folded back in on itself against the file cabinet . \\n▁ i suppose when a ` ` session '' was taking place , she 'd extend it , giving the poor , depressed soul some false illusion of privacy . \\n▁ like there was any true privacy in this school , or this town for that matter . \\n▁ ` ` come on in , lucas . \\n▁ have a seat . '' \\n▁ i took a final glance at the empty room , well , empty except for the counselor sitting at her desk , tucked in the oasis of her small office , and sighed . \\n▁ irritated at having to do this , i grumpily walked over to her , tossing my backpack on the floor before unceremoniously dropping into the chair . \\n▁ she watched me harshly sit down and then a small smile lifted the corners of her lips . \\n▁ she reminded me of a leprechaun . \\n▁ why ? \\n▁ i do n't know . \\n▁ she was n't a tiny pixie wearing buckled shoes and a green top hat . \\n▁ no green on her at all , actually . \\n▁ it was probably the hair - bright red with springy curls and a splattering of matching freckles marking her nose and cheeks , all of it highlighting her incredibly blue eyes . \\n▁ if i had n't heard her speak already , i 'd expect an irish brogue to pour from her mouth . \\n▁ i adjusted in my seat uncomfortably as we both stared at each other silently . \\n▁ she sat back in her chair , absentmindedly flipping a pencil in her hands . \\n▁ she had strong looking hands . \\n▁ they matched her sturdy frame and solid looking bone structure . \\n▁ a delicate and tiny flower she was not . \\n▁ i could easily imagine her grabbing a plow and tilling one of those irish hillsides . \\n▁ getting uneasy with the silence enfolding us , i coughed and looked around her office again . \\n▁ she finally spoke as she watched me assess my environment . \\n▁ ` ` looking for an escape , lucas ? '' \\n▁ i shifted my attention back to her , noticing how often she 'd already used my name , and wondering if that was some ` ` counselor '' technique to make us seem like we were old friends already . \\n▁ it might work better if i knew her name too . \\n▁ i shook my head , but did n't answer her verbally . \\n▁ she smiled warmly and extended her hand . \\n▁ almost reading my thoughts , she said , ` ` my name is mrs . ryans , but you can call me beth . '' \\n▁ feeling strange , i grabbed her hand . \\n▁ her grasp was as firm as i 'd suspected it to be . \\n▁ i awkwardly shook it for a moment and gratefully pulled my hand back to my lap when she let go . \\n▁ she tilted her head as she assessed me and i could n't help but wonder what psychosis she 'd already assigned to me . \\n▁ ` ` do you know why you 're here , lucas ? '' \\n▁ i sighed and looked at the ceiling , hating this already . \\n▁ ` ` because i was xxunk … '' i looked back down at the teacher - like person before me and shifted my coarse language , '' … impaired … on school grounds . '' \\n▁ her lips twisted into a wry grin and i was pretty sure she knew exactly what i 'd been going to say . \\n▁ ` ` that 's what you did to get here . \\n▁ but why are you here , lucas ? '' \\n▁ i scrunched my brow , already lost . \\n▁ why did therapist people feel the need to talk in circles ? \\n▁ could n't she just tell me i was a messed up waste of space and let me go ? \\n▁ ` ` i do n't understand … are n't they the same ? '' \\n▁ she smiled and softly shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` no , not even remotely . '' \\n▁ i scowled , still confused and shook my head too . \\n▁ ` ` well , you 're the one with the diplomas . \\n▁ are n't you supposed to tell me ? '' \\n▁ she lifted a red eyebrow at me . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to ? '' \\n▁ i sighed and rolled my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` are you going to do the ` answer every question with a question ' thing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to do that , lucas ? '' \\n▁ when i scowled again , she laughed a little and added , ` ` that was a joke . '' \\n▁ surprise washed through me that she 'd both laughed and teased me . \\n▁ i do n't know why . \\n▁ i guess i just expected all sternness and severity from a counselor . \\n▁ i found myself relaxing just a little bit and felt a small smile lighten my features . \\n▁ her face brightened considerably . \\n▁ ` ` ah , you do know how to smile . \\n▁ i was beginning to wonder . '' \\n▁ i looked down and shrugged my shoulders , trying to not be amused by her . \\n▁ softly she added , ` ` you seemed angry when you sat down . \\n▁ why ? '' \\n▁ i looked back up at her , not sure why she could n't guess that . \\n▁ i 'd been caught doing something inappropriate , that was n't even my fault , and this was my punishment . \\n▁ why would i be happy about any of that ? \\n▁ a shot of true anger did sear through me then , as i remembered all that had transpired to get me here , in this office , talking to someone i did n't want to talk to . \\n▁ i did n't want to talk to anyone , anyone alive anyway . \\n▁ i scowled as i answered her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m only here because the safe and sound club kicked me out , and i want back in . \\n▁ it makes me angry that i have to do this . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ she cocked her head at me , looking like she was truly fascinated by my answer . \\n▁ i wondered if that was another technique - feigned interest , she was probably prepping a grocery list in her head . \\n▁ that thought incensed my already revved up temper . \\n▁ i really did not want to be here . \\n▁ ` ` because ! '' \\n▁ she only stared at my response and i floundered for a more substantive answer . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , god , the club 's entire frickin ' motto is ` because we care about you ' . '' \\n▁ i flung my arms out , as i started to get myself really ticked off . \\n▁ ` ` it 's supposed to be a club for troubled teens , who want to turn their life around … and they kicked me out ! '' \\n▁ tears surprisingly came to my eyes as i truly for the first time thought about this . \\n▁ ` ` me , the one kid in this school that people look at like … like i ' m a washed up , messed up , worthless piece of shit ! \\n▁ the one most in need of help , the most messed up one here … and they wo n't help me ! '' \\n▁ i brought my hands to my chest as i felt actual tears drop to my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` i want in … and they wo n't take me . \\n▁ what does that say ? '' \\n▁ i threw my hands out again , embarrassed at my words and my tears , but also feeling relieved for getting that unknown hurt off my chest . \\n▁ i expected her to tell me the school was right . \\n▁ i expected her to tell me i did n't belong in that club . \\n▁ i expected her to berate me for my language . \\n▁ i expected her to recommend several different twelve step programs . \\n▁ what i never expected … was for her to say this : ` ` well , lucas … it kind of sounds hypocritical to me . '' \\n▁ a rebuttal had been on my lips and it immediately fell off my tongue as my mouth dropped open . \\n▁ i realized then , that the tilt of her head was her truly listening to me , that that glint in her eye was her showing true concern for my well being . \\n▁ i stared at her , suddenly not seeing someone sent by fate to torture me even farther for my mistakes . \\n▁ for the first time ever … i saw a living human being that i could potentially talk to . \\n▁ i mean , really talk to . \\n▁ it terrified me . \\n▁ i swallowed and pushed the icy terror back . \\n▁ what i said or did n't say , was still my choice . \\n▁ letting my momentary panic subside , i quietly answered , ` ` yeah … me too . '' \\n▁ we talked about more mundane things for the rest of my time there - my relationship with my mom , my non - existent relationship with my father , what i liked to do , what i used to like to do , my plan for next year . \\n▁ she did n't ask me about the crash . \\n▁ she did n't ask me about the gossip that swirled around me . \\n▁ she did n't ask about my relationship with sawyer , or any other girl for that matter . \\n▁ she did n't even ask me about the incident that got me in her office in the first place . \\n▁ after my emotional outburst , her questions were tame and easy to answer . \\n▁ as i stood to leave , i was a little surprised by the entire thing and relieved that i 'd gotten through it , without making too big a jackass out of myself . \\n▁ only five weeks and four more days to go . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ i waited in the hallway outside of safe and sound club for sawyer , my session not lasting as long as her meeting . \\n▁ i was deep in thought over my hour with mrs . ryans … beth , when the door opened and kids started pouring out . \\n▁ i barely noticed the whispers and stares as i sat on the floor and waited for sawyer to see me . \\n▁ eventually all the kids left , and i could see sawyer still in the classroom talking to ms . reynolds . \\n▁ she had her head down and was listening to ms . reynolds talk with a solemn expression on her face . \\n▁ ms . reynolds reached down for her hand , but then surprisingly took her wrist instead . \\n▁ sawyer 's head snapped up to look at her and she pulled back reflexively , an almost alarmed look on her face . \\n▁ i stood up , wondering if sawyer was about to get into another fight , but this time with a teacher , a generally nice teacher . \\n▁ sawyer started shaking her head at ms . reynolds , her face looking more and more frightened every second . \\n▁ as i stepped through the door , ms . reynolds turned to look at me and dropped sawyer 's arm . \\n▁ sawyer looked back at me and smiled genuinely , although her face was almost sickly white . \\n▁ scrunching my brows , i walked up to her side . \\n▁ ` ` everything … okay here ? '' \\n▁ i asked , feeling odd at having to almost confront a teacher . \\n▁ ms . reynolds gave me her warm , sympathetic teacher face . \\n▁ ` ` of course , lucas . '' \\n▁ her eyes flicked over to sawyer 's then back to mine . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer and i were just having … a conversation . '' \\n▁ before i could answer , her eyes brightened . \\n▁ ` ` how was your session ? \\n▁ i hear mrs . ryans is great , was she ? \\n▁ did everything go okay ? '' \\n▁ her questions came out in rapid succession and i had to focus on them so hard , that i momentarily forgot about the incident i 'd walked in on . \\n▁ ` ` uh … it was … fine , i guess . '' \\n▁ she put a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` great ! \\n▁ i ' m so glad , lucas . '' \\n▁ she patted my shoulder before nodding at sawyer and then turning to leave the room . \\n▁ i turned back to a still pale sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` well , that was weird . '' \\n▁ sawyer 's face was still a ghostly white shade as her eyes locked on the door ms . reynolds had just exited from . \\n▁ ` ` hey , you okay ? '' \\n▁ she snapped out of her daze and lifted her eyes to mine . \\n▁ some color returned to her as she flicked between my eyes . \\n▁ she gave me that wry smile i loved on her , the one that showed my favorite dimple . \\n▁ ` ` is n't that my line ? '' \\n▁ i laughed and slung my arm around her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` apparently , not today . '' \\n▁ she leaned into my body as we started walking from the room . \\n▁ ` ` how did your meeting go ? '' \\n▁ she asked quietly . \\n▁ keeping my head straight , i flatly said , ` ` it was fine . '' \\n▁ she pulled back from me , slightly frowning . \\n▁ ` ` luc … '' i sighed and looked down at my feet shuffling along , crossing over the multiple cracks in the hallway tile . \\n▁ ` ` really , it was fine . \\n▁ not great , not horrible … '' i looked up at her and shrugged , '' … just … fine . '' \\n▁ she twisted her lips at me and then sunk back down against my body . \\n▁ ` ` okay … well , i ' m glad it was n't horrible . '' \\n▁ i leaned my head against hers and sighed . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , me too , '' i muttered into her black , silky hair . \\n▁ a faint scent of the lemon that filled her car hit my nose and i smiled - content , once again . \\n▁ sawyer was quiet on the ride home and i did n't intrude on whatever she was thinking about . \\n▁ myself , i chose to stare out the window and reflect on my own day as well . \\n▁ besides the unfortunate teasing by will in english , really , the encounter with josh was the worst part of my day . \\n▁ even my outburst with the counselor had n't trumped that moment . \\n▁ i sighed and thought again about darren being disappointed in me , in the fact that i could n't save that friendship with his brother . \\n▁ maybe i 'd dream about him tonight and we could talk about it ? \\n▁ a hand across my leg snapped me out of my weird thought , and i looked over at sawyer studying me . \\n▁ i blinked and looked around at my driveway . \\n▁ apparently , we were here . \\n▁ i blushed and looked down at her hand on my thigh , wondering how long i 'd been spacing out in her car . \\n▁ her fingers touched my cheek and i looked at her . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ she asked softly . \\n▁ i grinned and shook my head at her . \\n▁ ` ` you just had to get one in today , did n't you ? '' \\n▁ she grinned and then giggled a little . \\n▁ she let just one knuckle stroke my face before pulling her hand away . \\n▁ i cocked my head at her and watched her slightly almond shaped eyes watch me , neither one of us feeling the need to break the contact . \\n▁ i smiled and then nodded my head at the door . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't suppose your parents would let you come in for a little bit ? '' \\n▁ she twisted her lips before sighing softly . \\n▁ ` ` no … i asked , but , they know you 're back in school , and do n't think i need … to be here . '' \\n▁ she shrugged unhappily and sighed again . \\n▁ i nodded and looked down , hating that her parents felt so strongly about me , when they 'd never even met me . \\n▁ her fingers came back to my cheek and i looked up at her again . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not you , lucas . '' \\n▁ she frowned slightly . \\n▁ ` ` well , it 's mostly not you . \\n▁ mostly it 's me … okay ? '' \\n▁ i smiled again and leaned into her fingers , nodding , but not understanding . \\n▁ i still did n't know what she 'd done to so distraught her parents . \\n▁ she just did n't seem that outrageous to me . \\n▁ she seemed well adjusted and responsible and wise beyond her years . \\n▁ a part of me wished her parents would just get over whatever had happened with that boy and start trusting her again . \\n▁ i briefly wondered if they disliked me , simply because i was also a boy . \\n▁ maybe it had nothing to do with my reputation after all , although , i doubt that helped . \\n▁ her fingers still on my cheek , i reached behind her neck and pulled her forehead to mine . \\n▁ sighing , i rested our heads together for a second before preparing to leave her . \\n▁ at least it was only a few hours today and not a full day . \\n▁ that thought encouraged me and i was smiling as i pulled away from her and opened the door . \\n▁ she had a small , thoughtful grin on her face while she watched me leave . \\n▁ i waved at the door and then shut it and stood there , while she pulled away . \\n▁ feeling that the day had ended on an upbeat note , i entered my house for a long night of homework , bad tv and hot pockets . \\n▁ mom was late at the diner and she was still gone when i dragged my tired body to bed . \\n▁ i changed into my pajamas , laid my head back on the pillow and closed my eyes , all with the thought of ` please let me see my friends ' repeating over and over in my head . \\n▁ within moments my eyes felt heavy and sleep lulled me under . \\n▁ i floated in that realm of unconsciousness for what seemed like an eternity - just blackness , darkness , nothingness … peace . \\n▁ then i was standing in my living room , fully dressed and staring out the sunny window . \\n▁ a hand on my shoulder startled me and i slowly turned , a grin spreading across my face as i did so . \\n▁ ` ` lil ? '' \\n▁ auburn hair and gold eyes met my vision and i smiled wider . \\n▁ ` ` hey , sammy . '' \\n▁ she laughed and engulfed me in a warm hug . \\n▁ ` ` oh , luc , it 's so good to see you . '' \\n▁ she pulled back and looked over my face . \\n▁ ` ` our last visit was n't nearly long enough . '' \\n▁ i nodded and smiled as i held her close to me . \\n▁ our last visit had been awhile ago , back when i 'd first started my hiatus from school ; she 'd come in with lil , and the three of us had met up only briefly before the dream had fallen away from me . \\n▁ that had been ages ago , or so it seemed now that we were alone together . \\n▁ she laughed in my arms and hugged me tight again before letting go . \\n▁ ` ` darren would kick your ass if he saw us embracing like this , '' she muttered , as she playfully pushed my shoulder back . \\n▁ i grinned at her . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , lil too . '' \\n▁ i stepped back and admired my beautiful friend , practically my sister . \\n▁ ` ` you and i are n't usually alone . '' \\n▁ i frowned as i considered that . \\n▁ ` ` in fact , we ' ve never been alone … not in my dreams … '' i sighed as her expression softened . \\n▁ ` ` god , are you here to tell me i ' m nuts too ? \\n▁ to tell me to back off from lillian and live my life ? \\n▁ blah , blah , blah … '' she grinned wider as i crossed my arms over my chest . \\n▁ she shook out her red hair while she chuckled . \\n▁ ` ` no , luc . \\n▁ you ' ve had a hard day . \\n▁ i ' m not going to berate you for wanting to see a friendly face . \\n▁ ` ` her expression turned serious before shifting to a playful scowl . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m here … to kick your ass . '' \\n▁ my eyebrow lifted at that and she broke into a grin , stepping aside so that i could see past her , to the board game set up on the middle of the living room floor , highlighted in a bright patch of sunlight . \\n▁ i looked back over to her and chuckled . \\n▁ glancing at the game again , my chuckle turned into a hearty laugh . \\n▁ ` ` you 're going to beat me … at the game of life ? \\n▁ seriously ? '' \\n▁ she laughed too and stepped up to my side , grabbing my hand and leading me to a side of the board . \\n▁ ` ` it seemed fitting , '' she said over her shoulder . \\n▁ i gave her a wry smile . \\n▁ ` ` nice . '' \\n▁ she sat down cross legged on one side of the board while i took the other . \\n▁ i momentarily glanced at the other two empty sides . \\n▁ she glanced with me and smiled . \\n▁ i gazed at her eyes , glowing warmly in the sunshine and let myself feel the peace of her remembered company . \\n▁ sammy and i had always gotten along , but truly , as much as i enjoyed being with her right now , i wanted to see everyone . \\n▁ i indicated the free space around the board . \\n▁ ` ` we need more players . \\n▁ do you mind ? '' \\n▁ she shook her head , still smiling warmly and i concentrated with everything i had at the spot on the floor to the right of sammy . \\n▁ hazily at first , and then more solidly , darren finally appeared and she smiled over at him . \\n▁ he glanced at us and then down at the board set between us . \\n▁ ` ` sweet ! '' \\n▁ he looked at both sammy and i while he raised a finger in the air . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m the doctor ! '' \\n▁ sammy rolled her eyes , but laughed . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't call the occupations nimrod . '' \\n▁ darren gave her a level look . \\n▁ ` ` and yet , i just did . '' \\n▁ she started to protest , but he leaned in and kissed her , cutting off her objection , just like he usually did . \\n▁ ` ` hey , sexy . '' \\n▁ i grinned at the sight of them making out , happy that darren was n't going to bug me about bringing them here , that he was just going to visit with me . \\n▁ twisting my head , i concentrated on the spot beside me . \\n▁ nothing happened at first and i started to worry that nothing would . \\n▁ and then , so suddenly that it surprised me , lil was sitting beside me , laughing at darren and sammy who were playfully smacking each other . \\n▁ ` ` hey , beautiful , '' i whispered , as i leaned over to kiss her . \\n▁ she grinned breathtakingly and met my lips halfway . \\n▁ i paused after a few light touches to her soft , fragrant skin . \\n▁ ` ` are we fine ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , knowing how ridiculous that sounded , but needing her assurance anyway . \\n▁ our last meeting had been … intense . \\n▁ her hand came up to my cheek and she bit her lip while she searched my face . \\n▁ ` ` luc … i. . . '' \\n▁ suddenly a couch pillow smacked me on the side of the head . \\n▁ irritated , i turned to glare at a laughing darren . \\n▁ he held his hands out . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ he pointed at me . \\n▁ ` ` you had a rough day and brought us here for some fun … right ? '' \\n▁ he cocked his head to the side and twisted his lips into a frown . \\n▁ ` ` not some emotional outpouring of everything that 's going on , everything we never got to say to each other , '' his hands mimed lips talking , ` ` yada , yada , yada … '' i laughed and felt myself relaxing , and lil beside me did as well . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , let 's just play . '' \\n▁ i decided then , that any painful conversations i wanted to have with lil , over our intimacies lately , and darren , over his brother , could wait . \\n▁ tonight , i just wanted to have fun with my friends again . \\n▁ playing that dream game of life with my deceased friends , brought a smile to my lips that lasted the entire time . \\n▁ i held lil 's hand as we teased each other over the careers we received - her , a well paid superstar , me , a struggling artist - and gave her a kiss when she got married . \\n▁ after seeing that , darren commented that she was having an affair on her blue husband , which made us both giggle . \\n▁ for his part , darren kept the mood in the room light , helping to give me a nice memory to take with me tomorrow , when i rejoined the harsh ` ` real '' world . \\n▁ i wished i could stay in this quiet room forever , playing board games with my friends - watching lil gaze at me lovingly , watching sammy laugh as she raked in the dough , and watching darren complain about sammy 's ` ` life '' . \\n▁ ` ` seriously , another kid ? \\n▁ are you a part puppy or something ? '' \\n▁ he grumbled when she landed on yet another ` ` baby '' space . \\n▁ she grinned and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i ' m really fertile . \\n▁ besides , i like kids . '' \\n▁ she raised an eyebrow at him . \\n▁ ` ` they help you win the game , you know . '' \\n▁ she looked at his car piece , pointedly . \\n▁ he scowled and pointed at her packed car on the game board . \\n▁ ` ` for fuck 's sake , sammy … you ' ve got five of the little bastards already . \\n▁ they do n't even fit in the car . '' \\n▁ he smirked at her . \\n▁ ` ` could n't you turn down your deadbeat husband every once in awhile ? '' \\n▁ he motioned to the back of her car , where a lone blue person was surrounded by a sea of pink . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , you put the poor , jobless jerk - off in the back seat . '' \\n▁ he grinned wryly at her while lil and i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` how much love could there be ? '' \\n▁ sammy twisted her lips in an amused expression of annoyance . \\n▁ ` ` it 's better than your situation . '' \\n▁ she pointed to darren 's car , where only his blue piece and a fallen over pink one resided . \\n▁ ` ` and what exactly is your wife doing anyway , with her head buried in your lap like that ? '' \\n▁ i laughed as i looked at darren 's car ; it really did look like that . \\n▁ darren chuckled at her and grinned seductively . \\n▁ he flicked a glance at me and i knew he was about to say something that was going to get him smacked . \\n▁ i grinned while he shrugged . \\n▁ when he did answer her , his voice was deeper and huskier . \\n▁ ` ` that 's just where i prefer my women . '' \\n▁ sure enough , sammy 's hand flashed out and smacked him harshly across the chest . \\n▁ he grunted while she laughed at him , lil and me joining in her merriment . \\n▁ ` ` oh , come on , cherry pie , '' he jokingly told her . \\n▁ she gasped at his nickname . \\n▁ while he 'd told me once that he called her that because of her reddish hair , she had always chosen to see the dirtier side of the pet name , and usually smacked him harshly whenever he said it . \\n▁ although , with the glint in her eye whenever he did , i was pretty sure the nickname turned her on . \\n▁ i was also pretty sure the name was repeated in their bed with far less violent results . \\n▁ with an impish grin , she reached behind her to a container of dip that we 'd been snacking on with some chips i 'd conjured up . \\n▁ dipping in her finger , she withdrew a glob and then swiftly flicked it at darren . \\n▁ it hit his shirt and he looked down at the mess , surprised . \\n▁ his eyes snapped up to where we were all giggling almost uncontrollably . \\n▁ his surprised face turned devilish . \\n▁ ` ` oh , it 's on now ! '' \\n▁ darren grabbed her wrist and pulled her on top of him as he lay down beside the board . \\n▁ he flipped her on her back and proceeded to run his hands up and down her sides while holding her legs firmly entwined in his . \\n▁ she screamed and squirmed as he tickled her . \\n▁ in between her fits of laughter and tears , she begged lil and me for help , but wiping tears from our own eyes , we shook our heads . \\n▁ neither one of us were going to get mixed up in their flirting . \\n▁ lil and i glanced at each other when our friends shifted to wrestling … or foreplay . \\n▁ she smiled warmly at me , running a hand over my forehead and brushing aside some of my hair . \\n▁ she sighed and looked torn about something . \\n▁ i was about to ask her ` ` what '' when she leaned forward and pressed her lips to mine . \\n▁ her hand snaked around behind my neck , pulling me close as our mouths moved together . \\n▁ my heart surged and i cupped her face with my hands , my thumbs brushing over her cheekbones as the tips of my fingers twisted around her silky , pale hair . \\n▁ just as the kiss was deepening , as my head was tilting so i could feel more of her lips on mine , feel more of her tongue against mine , another pillow dinged me . \\n▁ seriously annoyed now , i glared over at a laughing darren . \\n▁ he held his hands up in surrender under the intensity of my sneer . \\n▁ ` ` hey … i know how you two are when you get going … '' he pointed down at the board game between us , ` ` can we finish the game before the nak * dness starts ? '' \\n▁ lil , her face still cupped in my hands , laughed , embarrassed , and pulled back from my fingers . \\n▁ i smiled and laughed with her , matching her tone , and then brought her over to my lap so i could put my arms around her and feel the life and warmth of the woman i loved while we finished our game . \\n▁ she giggled and settled down , grabbing my free hand and interlacing our fingers while she rested back on my chest . \\n▁ i kissed her head , the smell of her favorite shampoo suddenly assaulting me , while the ends of her long strands tickled my arm . \\n▁ with a grin plastered on my face , i pulled her tight and leaned over to spin the dial - ready to finish my game of life . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; a part of me reveled in the silence that permeated my day . \\n▁ a part of me longed for the friendships and polite acknowledgments that i 'd gotten from this crowd for most of my life . \\n▁ but that was a long time ago , emotionally if not physically , and i should n't dwell . \\n▁ if it were n't for sawyer though , i think i 'd have faded into the wallpaper of the school , wrapped in my loneliness and regret . \\n▁ luckily for me , sawyer did her best to bring me to life . \\n▁ well , she did her best to make me smile anyway . \\n▁ her parents had n't caved yet on the whole after school visit thing , so all we had was our time at school and the never ending rides she gave me . \\n▁ we took advantage though , laughing and telling jokes and stories throughout the day . \\n▁ sawyer had a knack for knowing just what mood i was in and skillfully turning it around , if needed . \\n▁ she did n't talk much about her own moods , but i kept a close eye on her after any class we were apart , waiting for some sign that she 'd been mistreated by the girls at school . \\n▁ i was a little shocked when she 'd confessed that she was teased over being poor . \\n▁ i guess i 'd just never noticed . \\n▁ she was bright and warm and funny , and that got my attention more than what she was wearing . \\n▁ of course , now that my attention was brought to it , i did see that she almost wore the exact same outfit every day : same jeans with the tears in the knees , same silver ring on her thumb , same converse sneakers . \\n▁ really , only the long - sleeve shirt or sweater got rotated . \\n▁ and over it all , she always wore my letterman 's jacket . \\n▁ i was finally realizing that it really was her only coat . \\n▁ i was finally realizing just what my handing it to her on that first day had meant to her . \\n▁ i ' m sure she 'd gotten some heat from the student body , and probably from her parents too , over wearing a boy 's coat , but it was something she did n't have that she 'd desperately wanted , and a stranger had given it to her . \\n▁ if that were me , i 'd probably feel pretty bonded to that person . \\n▁ as we ate lunch in her car , i also noticed that , more often than not , she did n't have anything to eat , and i ended up sharing my lunch with her . \\n▁ it was n't even a conscious thought on my part , i just automatically grabbed whatever i had and split it . \\n▁ my mom and i struggled , although she still refused to let me get a job and help her , saying i needed to be seventeen while i was seventeen , and i 'd have a lifetime of working ahead of me , but we still had the basic necessities . \\n▁ sawyer seemed to live just under that . \\n▁ it made me feel even more protective of her . \\n▁ i 'd thought about confronting brittany , who seemed to lead the pack that teased her the most , but i did n't . \\n▁ i knew i would n't like it if she tried to take on will or josh , so i did n't attempt to fight her battles for her . \\n▁ besides , she seemed to have a great handle on what was truly important in life . \\n▁ she understood better than most , that bad situations were n't necessarily permanent ones , and life could get better . \\n▁ i had less of a handle on that . \\n▁ i usually felt a little melancholy about my life . \\n▁ it was less intense when sawyer was present , but it was still there , and when she left , sometimes it was unbearable . \\n▁ my dreams eased that ache , but added a different one too . \\n▁ i 'd missed my friends after our impromptu board game , which sammy had won readily . \\n▁ when i had woken up the next morning , i 'd stared at my ceiling for a good ten minutes , reliving the dream , committing it to memory … wishing it was real , wishing i could crawl back inside that dream and disappear - stay there forever . \\n▁ my dreams always felt so real . \\n▁ sammy 's laugh , darren 's dirty comments , lil 's sweet touches … it all felt more real than the bleakness of being nearly invisible at school . \\n▁ my head hit the pillow every night , ready to let go of my day , and spend some more time with them . \\n▁ it did n't always work , i did n't always see them , but , when i did , it was divine bliss … and pure torture . \\n▁ because a part of me knew , that no matter how real it felt , it was n't , and my friends were long gone and buried , moved on to somewhere that i could n't follow . \\n▁ and that sort of killed me . \\n▁ i considered talking to the counselor about my dreams , about how i 'd live in them if i could , but i never brought it up . \\n▁ i did n't bring up much around mrs . ryans . \\n▁ sure , she asked a lot of questions and eventually got me talking about some of the tamer things in my life , but my friends were an issue i skirted around . \\n▁ she seemed to realize that too . \\n▁ she 'd try and casually slip them into conversation - so how are things going in the classroom ? \\n▁ anyone trying to pick fights with you ? \\n▁ did you ever fight with your friends … darren or sammy or lil ? \\n▁ what were those relationships like ? \\n▁ ah … smooth . \\n▁ i 'd look down and shrug and give her the standard ' i do n't want to talk about it ' answer of , ` ` everything was fine . '' \\n▁ she finally did bring up the incident that got me sent to her in the first place - me being clearly out of it at school . \\n▁ she asked why i had done that , and in such a public way , and i 'd shrugged at her and started to say ` ` i do n't know '' , when instead i slipped out , ` ` i did n't , i was drugged . '' \\n▁ her eyebrows shot up as high as mine . \\n▁ i really had n't meant to mention that . \\n▁ locking my jaw , so i did n't spill any more , i watched her wide eyes take in my face . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't ? '' \\n▁ she tilted her head as her eyes narrowed , appraising me , searching for the honesty of my admittance . \\n▁ i straightened my posture and lifted my chin , meeting her squarely in the eye . \\n▁ i may be guilty of a lot of things in my life , but this was one thing i was n't guilty of . \\n▁ feeling an odd soft of self confidence , i decided to go with it . \\n▁ ` ` no … someone slipped something in my water . \\n▁ i accidently drank it , when sawyer gave me some aspirin for my headache . '' \\n▁ she tapped a pencil on her desk while she looked at me thoughtfully . \\n▁ i was n't sure what she saw : a liar , a troubled kid , a victim . \\n▁ i did n't know what i wanted her to see either . \\n▁ i did n't feel like any of those things . \\n▁ finally , she dropped her voice as she spoke , ` ` that 's a serious accusation , lucas … have you gone to anyone about this ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ without meaning to , i let out , ` ` i do n't have the best reputation . \\n▁ no one would believe me . '' \\n▁ she sat back in her chair as she considered that . \\n▁ her face struggled with something , and i wondered if she even believed me . \\n▁ a surprising flutter in my stomach caught me off guard , and i realized that i wanted her to believe me . \\n▁ i almost needed her to . \\n▁ her face finally settled into a professional mask and she leaned forward on her elbows . \\n▁ ` ` do you know who did it ? '' \\n▁ i immediately shook my head again . \\n▁ a small slice of happiness burst through me that she seemed to be believing my story , but i still was n't going to mention josh 's name . \\n▁ that was a can of worms that i did n't need opened . \\n▁ besides , i was letting him go … letting what he 'd done to me go . \\n▁ bringing it up , getting him busted - none of that mattered . \\n▁ she narrowed her eyes at me again and i knew that she did n't believe that . \\n▁ i expected her to press me on it , but she surprisingly changed the course of our conversation . \\n▁ maybe my admittance , made her believe i 'd admit to more . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … can you tell me what you remember of the accident ? '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open as what she 'd asked me , mentally took me back a step . \\n▁ she 'd asked about my friends before , but never that , never about the actual wreck . \\n▁ it was such a shift from what we had been talking about , that my mind was too stunned to respond properly . \\n▁ luckily , i was so used to the lie that it automatically rolled off my tongue . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ my senses recovered somewhat and i bristled at her question . \\n▁ why did everyone feel the need to ask that ? \\n▁ ` ` i thought i was in here for being wasted at school . \\n▁ what does … that … have to do with anything ? '' \\n▁ i knew my face was a scowl , but i could n't seem to soften it . \\n▁ hers softened as she looked over my expression . \\n▁ in a quiet voice , she answered , ` ` it 's all connected , lucas . \\n▁ are you sure you do n't remember ? \\n▁ what were you doing right before the crash ? '' \\n▁ laughing , talking … living . \\n▁ i shook my head , even more harshly . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ i. . . \\n▁ i do n't remember . \\n▁ i already said that ! '' \\n▁ her face still calm , even though i 'd just yelled at her , she said , ` ` what is the last thing you do remember ? '' \\n▁ i clenched the chair , preparing to stand and storm out of the room . \\n▁ heat and anger coursed through my veins , all with an icy edge , an edge of fear . \\n▁ i wanted her to stop . \\n▁ i did n't want to talk about this . \\n▁ talking about it would be like grabbing a knife and cutting out my own heart . \\n▁ i was n't capable of that . \\n▁ my throat locked up and i sputtered for words while tears clouded my vision . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ i. . . \\n▁ i do n't . \\n▁ please … stop … '' a tear rolled down my cheek and she sighed softly when she saw it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , lucas . \\n▁ i know this is painful , but it 's part of the process . \\n▁ you need to get this weight off of you . \\n▁ it 's smothering you . \\n▁ do n't you see that ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head as more tears followed the first . \\n▁ i swallowed , hating that i felt on the verge of screaming and sobbing . \\n▁ i could feel more awful tears and looked at the floor to try and calm myself down . \\n▁ wanting it to end , i muttered , ` ` nothing , i remember nothing . '' \\n▁ she answered me equally as quiet , maybe bolstered by the fact that i had n't fled the room yet . \\n▁ ` ` they say beer was in the car , but you tested clean at the hospital … were you drinking , lucas ? '' \\n▁ my head shot up as the second most popular question passed her lips . \\n▁ i could n't help the hurt in my face that she 'd ask that . \\n▁ with everything we 'd talked about and every connection i 'd thought i 'd had with her , i sort of expected her to instinctively know the answer to this . \\n▁ with an echo of hurt betrayal in my voice , i answered her question more thoroughly than i usually answered anyone . \\n▁ ` ` no … i was n't . \\n▁ i took the keys because darren was drunk , then i drove us home . \\n▁ i was completely sober . '' \\n▁ hardness entered my voice as i shook my head , another tear falling . \\n▁ bitterly i spat out , ` ` you can take that or leave it . '' \\n▁ she looked down at her desk before lifting her gaze back to mine . \\n▁ she shook her head and her springy , red curls danced around her solid shoulders . \\n▁ a look of compassion crossed her face as she slowly answered me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're defensive . '' \\n▁ her compassionate look heightened my irritation . \\n▁ i do n't want to talk about this . \\n▁ i did n't understand why she could n't just let it go . \\n▁ i scowled , angry at myself for ever opening up to her . \\n▁ ` ` no one believes me anyway , so what does it matter what i say ? \\n▁ if i do or do n't remember ? \\n▁ if i did or did n't drink ? \\n▁ none of it matters . '' \\n▁ her eyes widened as surprise flitted across her features . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … it 's your voice . '' \\n▁ she leaned in over her desk again , her hair brushing over some papers as she tried to get even closer to me , maybe to convey that she really was on my side . \\n▁ ` ` it 's the only voice that matters . \\n▁ you 're the only one that was there . '' \\n▁ my face paled as i caught the error in her sentence . \\n▁ with only a ghost of a voice , i muttered , ` ` no , i was n't the only one there … that 's the problem . '' \\n▁ my mind flashed to my friends screaming in the car … lil 's head smacking the window . \\n▁ i felt my stomach rise . \\n▁ ` ` that 's true . '' \\n▁ she leaned back in her chair and sighed softly . \\n▁ ` ` alright , you are the only one that survived . '' \\n▁ her voice was soft and full of compassion , but my stomach rose even higher and my head started to swim . \\n▁ i dropped it and stared at my lap , wishing i could vanish . \\n▁ ` ` i know that … '' that was the one fact i was horridly aware of . \\n▁ she leaned over again and surprisingly put a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` so … lucas , one day you 'll actually have to start living . '' \\n▁ i looked back up at her , gazing at me with a genuinely sympathetic face . \\n▁ my body started to shake with the restraint to not break down in her office . \\n▁ she 'd hit too many sore points - blow after blow . \\n▁ i was depleted , i was exhausted … i was done . \\n▁ i needed out of her office . \\n▁ i needed one of my comforts , be it sawyer or a dream version of lil . \\n▁ standing on unsteady legs , i whispered , ` ` are we done ? '' \\n▁ she watched me struggling with multiple emotions and then nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yes , luc . \\n▁ i 'll see you monday after thanksgiving break . '' \\n▁ i nodded absentmindedly as i backed out of the room . \\n▁ i 'd nearly forgotten that i 'd get a small reprieve from both her and the school for a long weekend . \\n▁ of course , that meant no sawyer as well . \\n▁ i clutched my stomach and hustled out of her office and out of the school , so i could feel the cool , crisp air across my clammy skin . \\n▁ i sat on a step outside the main doors and dropped my head into my hands , finally losing it . \\n▁ sawyer found me like that , what felt like an eternity later . \\n▁ i did n't notice at first . \\n▁ i did n't really notice the flurry of bodies walking past me and feet shuffling under my vision as i kept my head resting on my arms , hugging my knees . \\n▁ i really did n't notice anything until i felt sawyer 's arms slink around my shoulders . \\n▁ she pulled me into her and i sniffled , begging the torrent of tears to not start up again . \\n▁ sawyer kissed my head and rubbed my back , not asking what was wrong . \\n▁ she did n't need to . \\n▁ she knew i 'd just come from the counselor . \\n▁ if i was this upset , she 'd know why . \\n▁ what else brought me to a blubbering mess than my friends ? \\n▁ not much . \\n▁ she kissed my head again and then laid hers down on my back as she continued rubbing circles on my jacket . \\n▁ she sighed softly and i finally felt the peace of her touch crawl into me . \\n▁ she whispered that everything would be okay and we sat in silence for long moments . \\n▁ eventually i shifted my stance and she lifted her head off my body . \\n▁ i sheepishly moved to look at her , wondering how horrid my eyes were . \\n▁ she bit her lip as she looked over my expression and then she lightly shook her head and put a hand on my cheek . \\n▁ i sniffled again and closed my eyes , leaning into her touch , stealing her warmth and kindness . \\n▁ ` ` ready to go home ? '' \\n▁ she whispered and i tiredly nodded . \\n▁ i wanted to leave . \\n▁ i wanted to crawl into bed and never get out . \\n▁ she helped me to my feet and slung her hand over my arm . \\n▁ she looked behind her and nodded to someone and i glanced back , seeing ms . reynolds watching the two of us with a concerned expression . \\n▁ i turned away before she could respond to me . \\n▁ i hated a teacher seeing me this way . \\n▁ i hated anyone seeing me this way , really . \\n▁ sawyer drove me home in that comfortable silence and surprisingly shut the car off when she pulled in my drive . \\n▁ i looked over at her and blinked sleepily . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ my voice was still scratchy from crying so hard on the steps . \\n▁ she put a hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m being a friend . '' \\n▁ she opened her door while i half - heartedly opened mine . \\n▁ she grabbed my arm again while i reached into my bag and grabbed my keys . \\n▁ i was n't sure what she was planning on doing , and i did n't want to get her in trouble , but i was eternally grateful that she was n't leaving me yet . \\n▁ i somehow managed to open the door and she pulled me back to my bedroom . \\n▁ i was so glum i could n't even wonder why . \\n▁ she took my bag off my shoulder and then took off my jacket . \\n▁ she gently prodded me to sit on the bed and then she undid my shoes and took them off . \\n▁ confused , i watched her lift my legs onto the bed and then softly push me down until i lay back on the pillow . \\n▁ i started to stay something , but she laid down on the edge of the bed , facing me , bringing her legs up to mine and wrapping her arms around me . \\n▁ she pulled me down to her shoulder and i felt the emotion re - bubble in me . \\n▁ i tried not to , but as my arms snaked around her waist , i felt the tears resurface . \\n▁ i dropped my head and let the tears fall onto her shirt . \\n▁ she shushed me and rocked me and whispered that it would be okay , while i embarrassingly cried in her arms . \\n▁ she stayed with me like that , gently rocking me , until my tears eased and sleep finally , and gratefully , took me . \\n▁ i awoke with arms still around me . \\n▁ i was n't sure how long i 'd slept , but i was sure sawyer was going to get in a lot of trouble for still being with me . \\n▁ even though i loved the comfort of her arms around me , guilt washed through me . \\n▁ as much as it meant that she 'd stayed , i did n't want her getting into trouble because of me . \\n▁ pulling back , i lifted my head from her shoulder and groggily spoke , ` ` sawyer , you should go . \\n▁ i do n't want … '' my scratchy speech cut off when my hazy vision cleared and i saw whose arms were around me . \\n▁ a small smile lifted the edge of my lip as i took in golden hair and pale blue eyes . \\n▁ with a stuttered exhale , i cinched my arms around her , pulling her as tight to me as i possibly could . \\n▁ ` ` lillian . '' \\n▁ she rubbed my back and then ran her fingers through my hair , pulling my head into the crook of her neck . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … '' she kissed my head and laid her cheek on me as i took long , deep breaths , savoring the remembered feel of her beneath my fingertips as i clutched her tight , the remembered sound of her as she hummed softly in my ear , and the remembered smell of her as my nose rested against her collar bone . \\n▁ i immediately knew that i was still sleeping , possibly with sawyer 's arms still around me , but i did n't care . \\n▁ i had my girl and i gripped her with everything inside of me . \\n▁ i could feel the tears building up as i remembered my emotional day and i swallowed them back , not wanting to cry into yet another feminine shoulder . \\n▁ she kissed my head again and then moved back to kiss my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … '' she pulled back farther to plant a kiss along my jaw and i moved my head so our lips could touch . \\n▁ the emotion broke over me at feeling her soft lips move under mine . \\n▁ a small sob escaped me without my permission and her hands flew to my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` oh , lucas … '' she muttered in the space between our kisses , ` ` i ' m so sorry . '' \\n▁ another sob hit me as my hands moved up to wrap into her long , blonde locks and she deepened the kiss , angling her head to take more of me inside . \\n▁ as her fingers brushed aside some stray tears and her tongue ran along mine , i let go of the emotion threatening to overtake me . \\n▁ i had my girl . \\n▁ my girl loved me . \\n▁ my girl was here with me . \\n▁ my girl was real , as real as anything else . \\n▁ i relaxed into the sensation of moving lips and tender fingers and eventually my breath became uneven for a different reason . \\n▁ i groaned and bent my body over her , pushing her gently back to the pillows . \\n▁ her fingers ran up to clutch my hair and she made a soft noise as she pulled me into her . \\n▁ one of my hands released from her hair to trail over her shoulder and slide over her breast . \\n▁ i cupped the molded shape of her bra gently , before slipping my hand up under her shirt . \\n▁ she sighed as my fingers slid up that creamy skin and i gasped when the tips of my fingers ran over a rigid nipple ; her bra had vanished . \\n▁ her fingers tightened in my hair and her lips more fiercely attacked mine , as i stroked my thumb over the sensitive peak . \\n▁ with a deep groan , i lifted her shirt and shifted my lips to that delicate skin . \\n▁ she moaned and arched against me , her fingers almost harshly urging my head closer . \\n▁ my lips covered her , my tongue swirled around her and i gently let my teeth scrape against her . \\n▁ she muttered my name and ran her leg up and down my calf . \\n▁ with a groan of my own , i placed a kiss between her br * * sts and then lifted her shirt to bring my attention to the other one . \\n▁ that was when my world shifted . \\n▁ suddenly lillian was n't writhing beneath me . \\n▁ suddenly she was standing near the window , chewing on her lower lip . \\n▁ i fell forward on the pillows when her body disappeared and it took me a second to adjust to the new situation . \\n▁ real feeling or not , that was a strange experience . \\n▁ i looked over to her staring at me with a worried expression , her pale hair catching the faint light of what looked like early morning rays . \\n▁ ` ` lil ? '' \\n▁ i asked , confused . \\n▁ she gave me a sympathetic face and took a half step toward me before pausing . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , luc . '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't why i came here . '' \\n▁ my brows knotted together as i tried to understand the sudden change in the room . \\n▁ i 'd been emotional when she first arrived , but she 'd calmed me and then aroused me . \\n▁ i had no idea why she was now pushing me away . \\n▁ ` ` lil , what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ i patted the bed beside me as i rolled to face her . \\n▁ ` ` come back to me . '' \\n▁ she looked like she wanted to take a step , but was forcing herself not to . \\n▁ she shook her head and worried her lip so hard i was afraid she 'd bite herself . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't , luc . \\n▁ i came here to comfort you . \\n▁ i know how hard today was , but we ca n't … we should n't … '' she sighed and closed her eyes for a second , and for a moment she looked just as tired as me . \\n▁ she tilted her head when she reopened them . \\n▁ ` ` luc , we should n't be together … like that . '' \\n▁ i sat up on the edge of the bed , my breath hitching . \\n▁ ` ` why not , lil ? \\n▁ it 's me and you … what could be more right than that ? '' \\n▁ she shook her head sadly . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not helping you , lucas . \\n▁ look at how hard today was for you … you could n't even talk about us . '' \\n▁ she shrugged her shoulders as she indicated me and herself . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't helping you move forward . '' \\n▁ i cocked my head at her . \\n▁ ` ` is this because of the field ? \\n▁ because we almost … '' she looked down and i stood up , walking over to where she stood at the window . \\n▁ i gently placed my hand under her chin , lifting her head so she 'd look at me . \\n▁ ` ` you wanted to , lil . \\n▁ we both wanted … '' she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i know … we were ready . '' \\n▁ she brought a hand to my cheek , rubbing her thumb back and forth . \\n▁ ` ` but making love to me … wo n't bring you happiness in real life , luc . '' \\n▁ she dropped her hand , her eyes misting over . \\n▁ ` ` and that 's what i need to think about - your happiness , while you 're alive . '' \\n▁ her voice choked up and she swallowed roughly . \\n▁ i put my hands on her waist , inching towards her . \\n▁ ` ` are you … breaking up with me , lil ? '' \\n▁ i rested my head against hers , knowing my question was stupid - you could n't get broken up with by a dead person - but my heart raced anyway . \\n▁ she exhaled brokenly and brought her hands to my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` oh , lucas … no . '' \\n▁ she rocked her head against mine . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not capable of that , not even in death , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i lowered my lips to find hers and she returned my kiss tentatively . \\n▁ ` ` lillian … i. . . \\n▁ i. . . '' \\n▁ i love you . \\n▁ i adore you . \\n▁ do n't ever go away . \\n▁ i need you … stay with me , because i 'll never love anyone but you . \\n▁ i wanted to say it , i wanted to finally pour my heart out to this warm , wonderful person in my arms … but i could n't . \\n▁ for some reason , i just could n't , and my throat completely locked up on me . \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc , '' she whispered , as she kissed me a final time . \\n▁ she pulled back to look over my face . \\n▁ ` ` i am glad that you 're finally starting to talk to someone about some things , lucas . '' \\n▁ she half - grinned . \\n▁ ` ` someone alive , that is . '' \\n▁ i half smiled at that and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i really have n't said anything … '' she put her hands on my arms , rubbing them up and down . \\n▁ ` ` not yet , but you 're trying . \\n▁ it 's a start . \\n▁ you should tell her about the wreck , luc . \\n▁ she 's right , you should n't hold that in . '' \\n▁ i frowned and started shaking my head . \\n▁ i did n't want to talk about that . \\n▁ she sighed at my reaction and tilted her head again . \\n▁ ` ` maybe it 's time you opened up … to sawyer . '' \\n▁ sawyer 's name passing her lips gave me an odd , guilty feeling . \\n▁ i looked down and bit my lip , knowing dream lil was well aware of everything that had transpired between the two of us . \\n▁ i felt her hand on my chin and reluctantly looked up at her . \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc . \\n▁ you 're … close with her . '' \\n▁ she smiled sadly and ran her thumb along my jaw . \\n▁ ` ` that 's the way of things , luc . \\n▁ that 's normal , that 's what moving on should be . \\n▁ it 's healthy and i. . . \\n▁ i want that for you . '' \\n▁ her eyes misted over and when a tear spilled down her cheek , i grabbed them and brought her face to mine , kissing her repeatedly . \\n▁ ` ` no , no , lil . \\n▁ i do n't care for her like i care for you . \\n▁ we 're just friends . \\n▁ i ' m not with her and i wo n't ever be . \\n▁ i 'd never do that to you . '' \\n▁ i pulled back as more tears spilled from her eyes . \\n▁ i had no idea if she was sad because of sawyer 's and my relationship … or because of what i 'd just said . \\n▁ it spilled out as my own xxunk ran through me , ` ` lillian , it 's you i ' m in lov - '' i jerked awake before the words fully left my mouth . \\n▁ i squeezed my eyes shut , willing sleep to take me , willing my dream to return , right where i 'd left off , desperate to finish telling lil i loved her - to finally get that off my chest . \\n▁ i could n't though . \\n▁ i was awake and sleep eluded me . \\n▁ i gave up and opened my eyes , looking around at my reality . \\n▁ being cold was the first thing i noticed . \\n▁ even though a blanket was over my dressed body , a chill went through me . \\n▁ a chill that said this is real , luc . \\n▁ that was fake and this is real . \\n▁ i clutched the blanket and brought it farther up my chest . \\n▁ the second thing i noticed was that it was dark out . \\n▁ i gazed out the window , not able to tell if i 'd only taken a long nap and it was early night outside , or if i 'd completely zonked out and it was pre - dawn . \\n▁ a quick glance at my clock confirmed that it was the latter . \\n▁ i 'd fallen asleep in sawyer 's arms and stayed asleep all night . \\n▁ my hand went to the spot on the bed where sawyer had been comforting me . \\n▁ i wondered how long she 'd stayed … and if she 'd gotten in trouble for it . \\n▁ i sighed and curled myself into a ball , feeling cold and alone and tired from too much sleep . \\n▁ my dream had started out so comforting but had turned on me and a pit of ice was firmly settled in my stomach . \\n▁ if lil turned her back on me … i was n't sure how i 'd get through my life then . \\n▁ i could n't imagine night after lonely night without ever seeing her again . \\n▁ i did n't even want to imagine it . \\n▁ the sounds of someone else awake , prodded me into movement . \\n▁ i stood and wiped the sleep from my eyes , yawning and stretching , all at the same time . \\n▁ i shuffled out into the living room and noticing the kitchen light on , made my way there . \\n▁ i smiled as i watched my small mother , dressed in her bathrobe and fuzzy pink slippers , preparing a turkey to put in the oven . \\n▁ her hands moved with practiced ease over the large bird , as she filled one end of it with stuffing and then shoved it in an oven bag . \\n▁ with everything i 'd been feeling lately , i 'd completely forgotten that today was thanksgiving . \\n▁ mom always had to work at the diner in the evening -lrb- it was a busy night for the restaurant , as those without a family to go to came in for some good food -rrb- , so mom always prepared our dinner early , always making a huge bird , so we 'd have leftovers forever . \\n▁ i think my mom felt guilty about my hot pocket dinner habit . \\n▁ she looked up at me when she noticed my entrance . \\n▁ she cocked her head and glanced at the clock . \\n▁ ` ` morning , honey , you 're up early ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged and walked over to the coffee pot to start a batch . \\n▁ ` ` i guess that 's what happens when you go to bed in the afternoon . '' \\n▁ she blinked before returning to her bird prep . \\n▁ ` ` afternoon ? \\n▁ you were deep asleep when i came home , but you were still dressed , so i covered you up . '' \\n▁ she paused before lifting the heavy bird to put it in the oven . \\n▁ ` ` you fell asleep in the afternoon ? \\n▁ are you feeling okay , honey ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged again and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m fine , mom . \\n▁ just tired , i guess . '' \\n▁ she looked about to say more on the matter , but i distracted her by opening the oven door and commenting on her turkey . \\n▁ ` ` i know you love turkey , mom , but that bird is huge . '' \\n▁ she grinned as she slid the heavy tray into the oven . \\n▁ ` ` well , i have a confession . '' \\n▁ i closed the door and she wiped her hands off on a towel draped over the handle . \\n▁ her face looked excited and guilty , and i raised an eyebrow at her . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be mad … '' she started and i frowned ; when people started sentences that way , it usually never ended well . \\n▁ ` ` what did you do , mom ? '' \\n▁ i crossed my arms over my chest and leaned against the counter , waiting . \\n▁ she bit her lip , but smiled . \\n▁ ` ` well , i did n't want to say anything , because i was sure it was n't going to happen . '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` in fact , i was positive it would n't , until i got a call last night at the diner . '' \\n▁ she grinned and her entire face lightened ; for a moment she looked ten years younger . \\n▁ i tried to keep my scowl , but smiled at seeing her so happy . \\n▁ ` ` what are you talking about ? '' \\n▁ she put a hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` i invited sawyer and her parents to dinner . '' \\n▁ she laughed softly . \\n▁ ` ` they said yes . '' \\n▁ my smile dropped . \\n▁ ` ` you what ? '' \\n▁ she scrunched her brows at my reaction . \\n▁ ` ` i invited … i thought you 'd like that ? \\n▁ the two of you seem so close … '' i shook my head , trying to understand what had just happened . \\n▁ sawyer 's parents had firm rules , and did n't seem to like me at all . \\n▁ they 'd agreed to come over ? \\n▁ come over … i 'd get to see sawyer today . \\n▁ i 'd prepared myself for a long weekend without her , and here i 'd get at least one more day with her , parents or not . \\n▁ i finally grinned widely and hugged my mom , who giggled like she was ten years younger . \\n▁ ` ` no , i ' m happy , really happy . \\n▁ i ' m just shocked , i guess . '' \\n▁ i pulled back and eyed my wonderful mother appreciatively . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , mom . '' \\n▁ i shook my head in disbelief . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't believe you did that for me . '' \\n▁ she shook her head and patted my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` oh , luc … there is n't anything i would n't do for you , you know that . '' \\n▁ she went about prepping dinner and i smiled softly at her before finishing my task of making us coffee . \\n▁ she glanced back at me over her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't easy though . \\n▁ her parents were very … resistant . '' \\n▁ i sighed as i filled the pot with water . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think they like me . '' \\n▁ she frowned at that . \\n▁ ` ` they do n't even know you . '' \\n▁ i avoided her gaze and poured the water into the pot . \\n▁ ` ` the rumors are everywhere , mom . \\n▁ i ' m sure they ' ve heard them . '' \\n▁ i whispered that and studied the flowing water , like my life depended on me watching it enter the machine . \\n▁ mom and i did n't usually discuss the torrent of gossip that surrounded me . \\n▁ in fact , we generally ignored that subject , a lot of subjects actually . \\n▁ her hand touched my arm . \\n▁ ` ` luc … look at me . '' \\n▁ briefly closing my eyes , i turned my head to see my exact shade of eyes warmly absorbing me . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll just have to convince them that the rumors are just that … rumors . '' \\n▁ she patted my arm and then brought a hand to my cheek as my eyes misted . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a good boy , lucas . \\n▁ sawyer is lucky to have you , and they 'll see that . \\n▁ i promise . '' \\n▁ i sniffed and shook my head , smiling a little to release the emotion building . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , sure , mom . '' \\n▁ she patted my arm a last time and then went back to her meal prep . \\n▁ i finished making the pot , ignoring the emptiness of her promise and focusing on the sentiment instead . \\n▁ for a moment , i wondered why my mom was still alone . \\n▁ she was wonderful and warm and so open to loving someone . \\n▁ as i watched her from the corner of my eye , i hoped that her own loneliness was n't because of me . \\n▁ i helped my mom in the kitchen for the rest of the morning with the things that she felt my inexperienced hands could n't mess up - mainly peeling potatoes and opening the can of cranberries . \\n▁ we worked in a comfortable silence , enjoying each other 's company without feeling the need to fill the space with chitchat . \\n▁ we got dressed and cleaned the house , putting on some cheerful music in the process . \\n▁ time passed and the kitchen filled with an aroma that made my stomach rumble . \\n▁ mom laughed at the loud sound and popped a giant - sized cookie in my mouth , just as the doorbell rang . \\n▁ smiling around the edge of the huge snack , my empty stomach suddenly felt full of swarming butterflies as i realized who was here - sawyer . \\n▁ i took the cookie out , taking a large bite , and eagerly made my way to the door . \\n▁ i opened it with my cheeks full of my treat and started laughing softly in my anticipation . \\n▁ sawyer 's pale gray eyes were the first thing i noticed , followed by her huge grin and that straight , super dark hair , held back from her face by two silver clips that gleamed in the noon sunshine . \\n▁ then i flicked my gaze down at her hands , outstretched in front of her and holding a pumpkin pie . \\n▁ ` ` hi , lucas ! \\n▁ we brought dessert ! '' \\n▁ she giggled adorably , seeming to be as excited to see me , as i was to see her . \\n▁ i grinned and took the pie from her with one hand , while wrapping my cookie hand around her waist , pulling her in for a tight hug . \\n▁ that was when i noticed she was n't alone . \\n▁ a deep voice cleared their throat behind her and i opened my eyes , that i had n't even realized i 'd shut , and looked up at sawyer 's father scowling at me . \\n▁ oops . \\n▁ my getting handsy with his daughter was probably not the best way to make him feel at ease with me . \\n▁ i immediately dropped my hand from around her waist and straightened . \\n▁ with my ` ` grownup '' face , i handed the remainder of the cookie to sawyer -lrb- who took a big bite with an even bigger grin on her face -rrb- and extended my hand out to him . \\n▁ swallowing the last of the cookie in my mouth , i said , ` ` hello , sir , i ' m lucas west . '' \\n▁ my seriousness faded as delight broke over me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so glad you came . '' \\n▁ sawyer 's dad was intimidating . \\n▁ he seemed like he 'd be right at home chopping lumber deep in the forest and i wondered briefly what he did for a living . \\n▁ he was a good five inches taller than my six - two and much wider than me . \\n▁ his hair was a sandy brown and his eyes were a blue - gray color that complimented sawyer 's . \\n▁ i felt my grin slip as his lips twisted into a not amused look , and i took a step away from sawyer , just to be on the safe side . \\n▁ he harrumphed some sort of response and instead of shaking my hand , placed his on sawyer 's shoulder protectively . \\n▁ i swallowed and felt like taking a step back until a voice beside him spoke . \\n▁ ` ` we 're delighted to be invited . \\n▁ thank you , lucas . '' \\n▁ i glanced over at sawyer 's mother . \\n▁ i 'd always pictured her to be an older version of sawyer - super dark hair and beautiful gray eyes - but she could n't have been more different . \\n▁ her eyes had a slightly more noticeable almond shape than sawyer 's and were a light golden brown , her hair , a tawny color , that , aside from the xxunk , looked nothing like sawyer 's . \\n▁ but her smile … that was an exact match . \\n▁ she extended her hand out to me and i shook it lightly . \\n▁ ` ` it 's nice to finally meet you , lucas . \\n▁ sawyer has told us a lot about you . '' \\n▁ i glanced over at sawyer ; she looked beyond embarrassed , and was attempting to shake her dad 's hand off her shoulder . \\n▁ i suppressed a grin at sawyer 's irked face and stepped back , indicating inside . \\n▁ ` ` please … come in . '' \\n▁ sawyer 's mom smiled and grabbed her husband 's hand , urging him across the threshold . \\n▁ he seemed to follow her reluctantly , still skillfully keeping his hand on sawyer , his message coming across loud and clear - do n't touch . \\n▁ i ran a hand through my hair as i shut the door behind them . \\n▁ i caught sawyer 's eye as she ate the rest of my cookie . \\n▁ she rolled her eyes at her dad 's firm grip on her and then gave me that wry smile i loved . \\n▁ while her parent 's quickly eyed my home , i glanced at her outfit . \\n▁ i generally did n't notice what she wore , but i could n't help but notice today , it was such a change from her standard jeans and t - shirt . \\n▁ today , she was wearing a dress . \\n▁ it was simple , green and long - sleeved , but combined with her dark hair and light skin , it was beautiful . \\n▁ i grinned and mouthed , ' i like your dress ' . \\n▁ sawyer and i were good at lip reading , doing it a lot during class , and she smiled and flipped up the knee length hem in a quick curtsey . \\n▁ i started to laugh and her dad immediately swung his attention back around to me . \\n▁ seemingly on autopilot , his hand pulled sawyer back to him and she squeaked at the sudden movement . \\n▁ she turned her head to glare at him , just as my mom came out of the kitchen , swiping her hands on her slacks . \\n▁ ` ` oh good . \\n▁ mark , pam , you made it . '' \\n▁ my mom extended her hand out to the pair . \\n▁ sawyer 's mom , pam , took my mom 's hand in both of hers and warmly shook it . \\n▁ ` ` well , it was very generous of you to invite us , victoria . \\n▁ how could we say no ? '' \\n▁ she glanced back at her husband , who cleared his throat and stepped away from sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` yes , thank you . '' \\n▁ sawyer 's dad , mark , had a voice as low and deep as his size , and he seemed to dwarf my mom as he shook her hand after his wife . \\n▁ his face had softened into genuine kindness though and i took that to mean that his issue was with me and not my mother . \\n▁ that was to be expected , i suppose . \\n▁ my mom beamed as she shook their hands , happy to have company in her home again . \\n▁ ` ` please , call me vicky , only my mom calls me victoria . '' \\n▁ she glanced at sawyer standing beside me after introductions were finished . \\n▁ ` ` oh , sawyer … you look beautiful , honey . '' \\n▁ sawyer blushed and looked down at the compliment . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , mrs . west . '' \\n▁ sawyer and my mom had never truly been officially introduced , but they 'd seen each other plenty of times , including that unfortunate time when i was whacked out in the nurses ' office . \\n▁ there was enough familiarity between them that i did n't need to make any introductions . \\n▁ besides , my mom adored sawyer . \\n▁ sawyer made me smile , and at a time when not much did , that was enough to practically make sawyer family to her . \\n▁ mom looked over at me , a huge grin on her face . \\n▁ noticing the pie in my hands , she grabbed it and ruffled my hair . \\n▁ i bit back the embarrassment as she merrily thanked me for holding it . \\n▁ she artfully thanked sawyer 's parents for bringing it , complimenting mrs . smith on her shoes and mr . smith on his tie . \\n▁ both of sawyer 's parents had dressed up for the occasion , probably in the nicest clothes they owned . \\n▁ with the ease of someone used to throwing dinner parties , which we never really did , she ushered both parents into the kitchen to help her open a bottle of wine . \\n▁ she winked at me before she disappeared with them and i grinned ; mom had just given me alone time with a girl . \\n▁ i started to wonder just how much mom liked sawyer . \\n▁ i nodded over to the couch and sawyer followed me . \\n▁ she sat down beside me , fidgeting a bit as she remembered she was wearing a dress and not jeans , and finally crossing her legs demurely in front of her . \\n▁ she leaned back with me on the sofa and put her hand over mine , lacing our fingers . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't expecting to see you for awhile . '' \\n▁ i said quietly over the music . \\n▁ she shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't expecting it either . '' \\n▁ she glanced back at the kitchen . \\n▁ ` ` they told me last night when i got back from your place . \\n▁ they were a little mad that i was late , but when i told them that you were … '' she trailed off and i blushed and looked down . \\n▁ what i 'd been was bawling like a baby . \\n▁ great , she 'd told them that ? \\n▁ oh well , that was probably the least embarrassing thing they 'd heard about me . \\n▁ she cleared her throat . \\n▁ ` ` anyway , after that , they told me about the invite and i begged them to say yes . '' \\n▁ i looked over at her when i felt her squeeze my hand . \\n▁ ` ` surprisingly , they said okay . '' \\n▁ she grinned and leaned into my side . \\n▁ i leaned back into hers , leeching her comfort as surely as her warmth . \\n▁ ` ` well , i ' m glad they did . '' \\n▁ she smiled warmly and then a small frown turned her lips down . \\n▁ ` ` are you alright ? \\n▁ after last night , i mean . '' \\n▁ her free hand came up to cup my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` you were really upset … '' i swallowed and looked away , down to the ring on her thumb enclosed in my fingers . \\n▁ my own thumb came up to stroke the cool metal . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m fine . \\n▁ it was just … too much … '' i let that trail off , not wanting to go into details . \\n▁ sawyer did n't ask them , instead , switching the topic to her overprotective parents and the list of rules she 'd been given before leaving the house , one of which she was breaking already by being alone with me . \\n▁ i chuckled and she amended that , ` ` well , technically they said i was n't to be alone in your room with you , so i guess this is okay . '' \\n▁ she squeezed my hand and i laughed and leaned in to whisper in her ear , ` ` then i suppose i should n't tell them you were in my bed last night . '' \\n▁ she giggled and glanced back to the kitchen . \\n▁ ` ` god no , they 'd drag me out of here so fast , you 'd see the smoke trails . '' \\n▁ i sighed and looked over her face while she giggled . \\n▁ ` ` they really do n't care for me , do they ? '' \\n▁ her giggles subsided while she returned my gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i told you … it 's not you , luc . '' \\n▁ she bit her lip and i could tell there was a big fat ` but ' following that . \\n▁ i motioned with my hand for her to spit it out . \\n▁ she chuckled a little and shrugged her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` well , come on . \\n▁ i have a history of poor choices when it comes to guys and , here i am , hanging out with a cute boy who just got suspended from school for being high , and is surrounded by sordid rumors of drinking problems . \\n▁ you do the math . '' \\n▁ she eyed me with that adorable half smile and i grinned in spite of myself . \\n▁ ignoring the hurtful truth in her statement , i focused on the one part i could make light of . \\n▁ ` ` you … think i ' m cute ? '' \\n▁ she laughed so loud at that , that we both glanced back to the kitchen , but my mom was doing a great job of running interference for us . \\n▁ we laughed and talked some more while my mom occupied her parents , but eventually she did come out and motion to us that dinner was ready . \\n▁ our kitchen was too small for everyone to eat in , so we 'd set up a card table and some folding chairs in the living room . \\n▁ after everyone loaded up their plates with delicious smelling food , we all scrunched together at the table , sawyer and i taking one side , while one parent each took the three remaining sides . \\n▁ sawyer and i laughed and bumped each other playfully at our close proximity , which made her dad scowl and clear his throat at us . \\n▁ sawyer twisted her lips at him but i straightened up and stopped fooling around . \\n▁ he eyed us throughout the meal , like he was waiting for me to do … something . \\n▁ sawyer 's mom watched us too , but skillfully hid it between polite conversations with my mom . \\n▁ her dad did n't care about being polite ; he was practically screaming ` keep away ' at me . \\n▁ i would have found it funny , if he had n't been so intimidating . \\n▁ for her part , sawyer looked torn between accepting her parent 's xxunk and telling them off for it . \\n▁ i was n't sure where the line was for her , but when her dad suggestively cleared his throat when she leaned in to ask me for the salt and pepper , i thought she was quickly approaching it . \\n▁ sawyer sat back in her chair after that and scowled at him . \\n▁ he matched her look for a second , before shifting his eyes to mine . \\n▁ for a moment , i saw sawyer 's gray eyes staring back at me , and that momentary resemblance relaxed me some … until he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` so , lucas … '' my body tensed at the possible list of questions he could ask me . \\n▁ sawyer beside me tensed as well . \\n▁ he glanced over to her and shut his mouth , maybe changing his mind . \\n▁ he twisted his lips and sighing a little , shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` to be perfectly honest , we only agreed to come here today because sawyer begged us . '' \\n▁ everyone at the table stopped eating and an uncomfortable tension filled the room . \\n▁ i glanced at my mom , who was frowning at him . \\n▁ he cleared his throat and continued , ` ` but , now that we 're here , i think this is the perfect opportunity to say that … '' he took a deep breath and turned to face my mom , ` ` your son needs to keep his distance from our daughter . '' \\n▁ my mom dropped her mouth open in shock , her face paling at the directness of his statement . \\n▁ i felt sawyer beside me start to shake in anger and even sawyer 's mom closed her eyes and hung her head . \\n▁ either sawyer or my mom were about to lose it , i could tell from their looks and body language . \\n▁ surprisingly , i lost it first . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ why ? \\n▁ because of what happened with my friends ? \\n▁ because of the rumors about that night ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head , irritated . \\n▁ ` ` none of those are true . '' \\n▁ noisily throwing my fork down on my plate , i practically yelled , ` ` i ' m not a drunk ! '' \\n▁ his intense eyes focused on mine , but the next words spoken , came from sawyer 's mother and not him . \\n▁ ` ` no , lucas . \\n▁ this is n't because of your … situation , not solely anyway . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , confused , but she sighed and grabbed her daughter 's hand , squeezing it gently , her eyes nearly begging her daughter to calm down as sawyer looked about ready to smash her plate on the floor . \\n▁ ` ` this is because of sawyer 's … situation , '' she said quietly . \\n▁ the anger in my body instantly evaporated , replaced by concern for my best friend . \\n▁ i looked over at sawyer , who was shaking her head , tears starting to fill her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't understand , '' i whispered . \\n▁ sawyer jerked her hand away from her mom , who looked hurt by the rejection . \\n▁ her dad 's deep voice answered me , a surprising softness in it . \\n▁ ` ` she 's been through a lot this last year and she does n't need someone … like you … dragging her back down . '' \\n▁ i bristled at the derogatory tone in the word ` you ' , but it was sawyer who flew off the handle . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't drag me down , daddy . '' \\n▁ her hands flew up in the air as she glared between her two parents . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m doing better , you even said so yourself ! '' \\n▁ her mother reached over for her hand again , while my mom and i exchanged confused glances . \\n▁ i really had no idea what they were talking about . \\n▁ ` ` that 's because of your efforts , dear . '' \\n▁ sawyer pulled away from her hand again and shook her head , a tear dropping to her cheek . \\n▁ ` ` no - it 's because of him ! \\n▁ i ' m better because of him ! '' \\n▁ more tears fell and her voice started quavering . \\n▁ not caring that her parents were denouncing me in front of her , i wrapped my arms around her and pulled her tight , my need to comfort her , stronger than any stern warning her father could give me . \\n▁ she leaned into my side as her tears flowed freely . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't separate us , dad , we need each other . '' \\n▁ her pleading tone tore my heart and tears stung my own eyes . \\n▁ i was n't sure what was going on , but i knew this moment was critical for sawyer 's and my continued relationship . \\n▁ if they forbade her from seeing me … i was n't sure what would happen to me . \\n▁ ` ` she 's right … please ? '' \\n▁ i looked between her parents , begging clear in my eyes and in my voice . \\n▁ her father 's eyes turned surprisingly sympathetic and nearly as tired looking as my own mother 's eyes so often were . \\n▁ ` ` we just do n't want to see you hurt , sawyer … '' i immediately answered for her , as i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd never hurt her , she means everything to me . \\n▁ she 's my best friend . '' \\n▁ my mom , finally getting over her shock , started to interject , but sawyer 's mom placed a hand on her arm , staring intently at her husband , who seemed to be turning over my words . \\n▁ finally , he slowly said , ` ` just … a friend , you have no romantic interests in her ? '' \\n▁ sawyer straightened from my side and wiped a hand across her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` dad ! '' \\n▁ i ignored her protest and held his eye , knowing that this was the make or break point for her father . \\n▁ this was the way i could keep her close … by pushing her away . \\n▁ ` ` no … no , i ' m not interested in her that way . \\n▁ i ' m with someone … else . \\n▁ i have a girlfriend . '' \\n▁ the entire room silenced as my words sunk in . \\n▁ sawyer minutely inched away from me , shrugging my arm off of her . \\n▁ i could n't look at her , but i imagined that her face was confused , maybe even hurt . \\n▁ i glanced at my mother instead who kept looking at sawyer with bewilderment clear in her features . \\n▁ she did n't know what i meant , she never saw me with anyone but sawyer . \\n▁ she did n't realize i meant lillian . \\n▁ sawyer 's parents looked between each other with surprised faces . \\n▁ sawyer 's mom looked at her , concerned , but her father looked at me , pleased . \\n▁ ` ` oh , well … that changes things a bit . '' \\n▁ he smiled and leaned back in his seat . \\n▁ ` ` okay then , sawyer , if being his friend means that much to you , i suppose we can support it . \\n▁ you have improved and maybe he is why … '' he thought for a moment , while my mouth dropped open as i tried to understand what they were talking about . \\n▁ just when i was about to ask a question , he smiled and leaned forward in his chair . \\n▁ ` ` okay , the short visits you had before would be alright - but short mind you . '' \\n▁ he pointed at me when he said that , and i swallowed and nodded . \\n▁ i finally looked over at sawyer , worried i 'd hurt her , but she was eyeing her parents scornfully . \\n▁ ` ` well , thank you , dad , for bringing that up here , like that , and completely embarrassing me . '' \\n▁ she stood and tossed her napkin on her plate . \\n▁ ` ` the meal was wonderful , mrs . west , please excuse me . '' \\n▁ with that , she left the table and walked outside , slamming the door shut behind her . \\n▁ her father sighed and looked over at her mother . \\n▁ ` ` i suppose i could have handled that differently ? '' \\n▁ her mom sighed and twisted her lips at him . \\n▁ ` ` you think , mark ? '' \\n▁ she started to stand , to go after her daughter , when i stopped her . \\n▁ ` ` do you mind if i. . . ? '' \\n▁ i nodded my head over to where sawyer had gone and her mom sat back down and nodded . \\n▁ as i started to stand , her father put his hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't trying to insult you , son . \\n▁ i realize you mean a lot to her . '' \\n▁ he sighed wearily . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just trying to protect her . '' \\n▁ his eyes aged dramatically as he gazed at me . \\n▁ i swallowed and nodded at him before looking over at my mom . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be back in a minute , '' i said to her as i stood . \\n▁ she nodded , faint red splotches on her cheeks from listening to her son be sort of attacked right in front of her . \\n▁ she flicked glances at sawyer 's parents and i wondered if there would be words said when i left … probably . \\n▁ sighing softly , i made my way to the door . \\n▁ i closed my eyes before opening it , not relishing seeing the effect of my statement on sawyer . \\n▁ she knew we were n't together like that , we talked about it often enough , but sometimes … sometimes it felt like we were anyway , and i really had no desire to hurt her , by belittling our relationship in front of her family . \\n▁ it was just a means to an end . \\n▁ i closed the door softly behind me and cautiously made my way to where she was sitting on the front step , arms around her knees . \\n▁ she did n't look when i sat down , only hugged her knees tighter . \\n▁ it was chilly outside and neither one of us had jackets on . \\n▁ wondering if i should , i put a hand across her shoulders and pulled her into me . \\n▁ she sighed and laid her head on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` sorry about that , '' i muttered , as i ran a hand up and down her arm . \\n▁ she looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` my dad 's the ass , '' she bit out . \\n▁ i smiled at her and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` he just cares about you … that 's all . '' \\n▁ she leaned back and looked over my face . \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i wanted to ask her about the many parts of the conversation that i could n't follow , but her eyes still looked overly moist and i did n't want to make her break down . \\n▁ i wanted to make her happy , like she so often made me . \\n▁ i wanted to reiterate the good news that had come out of the whole debacle , that she could visit again , but she started speaking before i could . \\n▁ ` ` what did you mean … about seeing someone , lucas ? \\n▁ do you … do you have a girlfriend ? '' \\n▁ her voice was barely above a whisper and wavered on the end of her sentence . \\n▁ i stared down at my shoes , not able to look her in the eye . \\n▁ i could n't tell her about lillian - about meeting with her in my dreams , about all the times we 'd been intimate lately , and how it felt better to me than anything in reality , well , almost anything anyway . \\n▁ i could n't tell her , that to me , lil was still my girlfriend ; we were still in love , still together . \\n▁ i could n't tell her any of that - she would n't understand . \\n▁ still not meeting her eye , i whispered , ` ` no , there 's no one . '' \\n▁ no one alive anyway , i added in my head . \\n▁ ` ` it was just something to say … to get him off our backs . '' \\n▁ i finally looked over at her . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , he does n't need to worry about you and me . \\n▁ we 're just friends … right ? '' \\n▁ she smiled weakly at me . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , right … of course . '' \\n▁ i grinned and pulled her tight . \\n▁ ` ` happy thanksgiving , sawyer . '' \\n▁ she chuckled softly and laid her head back down to my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` happy thanksgiving , lucas . '' \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i felt sammy standing and opened my eyes to watch her lean form grab the other chair and swing it around to me . \\n▁ she sat right beside me and grabbed my hand , much like sawyer would have . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , lucas … not tonight . '' \\n▁ i squeezed her hand as my eyes watered even more . \\n▁ ` ` please ? '' \\n▁ i was n't sure who i was begging - sammy , lillian , my dream world … or myself . \\n▁ sammy was the one that answered though . \\n▁ ` ` she wo n't appear to you tonight , luc . \\n▁ as hard as you try , it wo n't happen . '' \\n▁ she lifted just one corner of her full lips . \\n▁ ` ` it 's me or nothing . '' \\n▁ i sighed and slumped against my chair before leaning my head over to sammy 's shoulder . \\n▁ i 'd take her over nothing any day . \\n▁ she leaned her head against mine and murmured into my hair , ` ` are you disappointed that it 's just me ? '' \\n▁ i raised my head to look at her . \\n▁ ` ` no , no of course not , sammy . '' \\n▁ i swallowed and looked down . \\n▁ ` ` i just … lil and i 's last moment did n't end well , and i wanted to talk to her about it . '' \\n▁ she sighed and clenched my hand . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ your last few moments alone with her have been kind of … intense . '' \\n▁ i shrugged and looked away . \\n▁ there was nothing i could hide from my friends . \\n▁ not here . \\n▁ ` ` right , i suppose you ' ve been getting into my dreams just like darren ? \\n▁ i suppose asking you not to , would be just as ridiculous as asking him not to . '' \\n▁ i shrugged again and looked back at her , feeling my cheeks heat . \\n▁ she laughed a little and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i would give you the privacy if i could , luc , but you know i do n't really have a choice . '' \\n▁ her finger came up to tap my head and i got the reference . \\n▁ all of this was in my head ; they all knew what i knew . \\n▁ i gave her a wry smile and shook my head . \\n▁ lil would know about me telling sammy that i loved her just now . \\n▁ of course , it was n't a big secret . \\n▁ we both knew we loved each other ; we just could n't seem to say it . \\n▁ she rested her chin on my shoulder as i thought about that . \\n▁ ` ` darren does have a point , you know , about you pulling us to you . '' \\n▁ i looked at her from the corner of my eye , wanting to object again , but holding my tongue . \\n▁ she sighed and raised her chin from my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` we love you , luc , but you ca n't have a life like this , always living in your head with us . '' \\n▁ her knuckle came up to stroke my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` what future is there for you like that ? '' \\n▁ i gave her a tired smile and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` that 's what you guys do n't seem to grasp . \\n▁ i do n't care . \\n▁ i do n't care about that life . \\n▁ i want you guys . \\n▁ i want my friends . \\n▁ i want to keep coming here , and seeing you and darren … and lil . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't keep having … intense moments with her , luc . '' \\n▁ her golden eyes narrowed at me , a shaft of light hitting them , and making them seem to glow with the life i so readily remembered from her . \\n▁ ` ` you 're hurting her and making her feel really guilty . '' \\n▁ she shrugged while i frowned . \\n▁ ` ` she feels really bad about the moments she 's already let happen . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped at that . \\n▁ i 'd never imagined making my girlfriend feel bad , by touching her . \\n▁ ` ` she 's feel bad … why ? '' \\n▁ she sighed and shook her head , like she was speaking in a foreign language to someone who could n't understand . \\n▁ and in a way , i did n't . \\n▁ what was wrong with me having an active fantasy life with my friends ? \\n▁ i was n't hurting anyone . \\n▁ no one even knew how often i hung out with them . \\n▁ the real world held no intrigue for me anyway , everything i wanted was right here . \\n▁ well , besides sawyer , i guess . \\n▁ she was the only thing worth getting out of bed for . \\n▁ ` ` because she wants you to move forward . \\n▁ she sees how you isolate yourself and shut down , barely talking to anyone , not saying nearly enough to your counselor . '' \\n▁ she raised her eyebrows and looked at me pointedly . \\n▁ ` ` if it were n't for sawyer , i think you 'd be mute . '' \\n▁ i shrugged and looked out over the shadows and light playing across the field . \\n▁ i briefly wondered if i should make it rain anyway . \\n▁ it would match my mood if sammy and i were drenched . \\n▁ ` ` i have nothing to say , '' i said flatly . \\n▁ she sighed heavily and i looked back at her . \\n▁ her brow was creased with definite irritation . \\n▁ it was an odd look to see on sammy , she was rarely ever angry . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not the same person , lucas . '' \\n▁ my own irritation spiked . \\n▁ ` ` of course i ' m not . \\n▁ i killed all of my friends - do you have any idea what that did to me ? '' \\n▁ her face immediately softened , her hand coming back to my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` yes … i do . '' \\n▁ as her thumb stroked my face , i whispered , ` ` can i please see lil now . '' \\n▁ she sighed softly and shook her head , slight tears stinging her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , luc … not tonight . '' \\n▁ i woke up after that , wishing i could go back into the dream and twist it the way i wanted to , twist my friends the way i wanted to . \\n▁ but then it would be completely false . \\n▁ if i made my friends do and say what i wanted them to , well , then they really would be gone . \\n▁ i closed my eyes , wondering if i was completely insane . \\n▁ it was early enough that i felt i could get up and start getting ready for monday morning back at school . \\n▁ i showered , shaved and dressed in a long - sleeve tee and baggy jeans . \\n▁ i was styling my hair in the mirror when the photo tucked in the edge caught my attention . \\n▁ i pulled it out and looked over the happy image of the four of us . \\n▁ things had been so different then . \\n▁ darren and sammy had been trying to convince lil and me to road trip to la over the summer . \\n▁ we probably would have . \\n▁ we probably would have all piled into darren 's car and made a memory that would have stayed with me ' til my death bed . \\n▁ i suppose that summer did leave a lasting impression on me , just not quite in the way i 'd expected . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ i turned to look at my open doorway and saw my mom leaning against it , watching me . \\n▁ i gave her a halfhearted smile before gazing at the picture one last time and then tucking it back in the mirror . \\n▁ still staring at my tired looking reflection , i heard her tell me that she 'd made some coffee . \\n▁ i nodded at her reflection , noting her own tired eyes . \\n▁ i walked over to her and slung my arm around her shoulder , walking together to the kitchen to start our morning ritual . \\n▁ she smiled up at me and patted my chest . \\n▁ when it was ready , we drank our coffees in silence , me staring out the window , turning over the dream with sammy , while mom quietly worked on a crossword puzzle . \\n▁ a horn honking startled me from my thoughts and i glanced over at my mom . \\n▁ she was studying her watch and i could almost see her mentally tracking the minutes . \\n▁ i looked over at the clock , but neither one of us were late for our days . \\n▁ ` ` you okay , mom ? '' \\n▁ i asked , as i stood to get my backpack . \\n▁ with the impatient look of someone waiting for something , she smiled and said , ` ` of course , everything is fine , honey . '' \\n▁ she stood and kissed my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` have a good day , luc . '' \\n▁ i nodded and wished her the same . \\n▁ with one last hug before i slipped on my jacket , i wished my mom well and made my way out to sawyer . \\n▁ i must have had a strange look on my face in the car , for she shot concerned glances at me the entire drive to school . \\n▁ once in the lot , she finally twisted to face me as she shut the car off . \\n▁ ` ` you okay , luc … i mean , really okay ? \\n▁ you seem … quiet . '' \\n▁ she cocked her head to the side , her silky hair shifting to flow over the shoulder of my letterman 's jacket . \\n▁ i blinked , making myself let go of the night i 'd had , and threw on my best ` i ' m fine ' face . \\n▁ her brows pulled together and i thought maybe i was n't pulling it off very well . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m … '' i started to say ` i ' m fine ' , but looking at her concerned face , i ended up saying , ` ` just a weird dream , that 's all . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just trying to process it . '' \\n▁ her face softened . \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ do you want to talk about it ? '' \\n▁ she placed her hand over mine and rubbed her thumb across the back . \\n▁ i smiled at her warmth , but shook my head . \\n▁ she would n't understand . \\n▁ ` ` no … '' i looked down and peeked up at her from the corner of my eye , hoping she bought my next sentence . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't … remember enough of it , to talk about it . '' \\n▁ she nodded and squeezed my hand , not asking for any further details . \\n▁ ` ` well , just keep in mind that dreams are just dreams . '' \\n▁ she smiled warmly , as she unknowingly broke my heart . \\n▁ ` ` they do n't mean anything . '' \\n▁ i felt my chest squeeze and looked away from her , opening the door . \\n▁ she opened hers as well and met me at the front of her car , holding her hand out for me . \\n▁ i took it with my head still down , willing the tears to stay in my eyes . \\n▁ dreams did n't mean anything ? \\n▁ but … what if dreams were all i had ? \\n▁ xxrep 10 * although the thanksgiving break had been a short one , it seemed to xxunk the school . \\n▁ there was a last day of school feeling around the campus , from teachers and students alike . \\n▁ everyone seemed ready to let studying go and kick back and have some fun during winter break . \\n▁ when i walked by groups of people with my head down , i could hear them making plans for the upcoming mini - vacation a few weeks away . \\n▁ i had no plans . \\n▁ i had no desire to make plans . \\n▁ all i really wanted was to keep seeing sawyer everyday and if i could n't do that at school , then at least i could look forward to her coming over to my house . \\n▁ i suppose in a way , those were my plans . \\n▁ the students buzzed with holiday energy and more than a few took notice of me again in their excitement . \\n▁ not that they found talking to me exciting , but their pent up energy needed some release , and tormenting me was one way to do that . \\n▁ will kept up his shoving , pushing and tripping , successfully sprawling me across the hallway one afternoon in such a nonchalant way , that it looked like i 'd stumbled over nothing and decided to spread eagle on the floor for the hell of it . \\n▁ yeah , the students in the hall when it happened had found that hilarious . \\n▁ and of course josh got over our intense conversation and started trying to stir things up again . \\n▁ he was prodded on by a few people around him , urging him to try kicking my ass . \\n▁ i stopped even looking at him . \\n▁ i could n't stop him from outright attacking me , but i could try and control how i responded to him . \\n▁ it did n't hurt any less , listening to him verbally attack me without even registering his existence , but it kept me in sort of a numb zone , where i did n't cry or yell or try and hit him . \\n▁ that was an improvement in my books , so i embraced the numbness . \\n▁ brittany continued tormenting me too , and , in her own twisted way , sawyer as well . \\n▁ when i met up with sawyer after art class , she 'd toss xxunk comments my way to her friends , then smirk at me suggestively when they were busy laughing . \\n▁ i had no idea what she hoped to gain by both flirting and xxunk me , but i wished she 'd stop . \\n▁ i really wished she 'd stop tormenting sawyer . \\n▁ i 'd come across her on more than one occasion with a hurt look on her face as some girls , led by brittany , walked away giggling . \\n▁ i had the sneaking suspicion that my callus remark about not being her boyfriend was to blame . \\n▁ the rumor mill was loving the fact that i was physically close to sawyer , but appeared to be emotionally distant from her - as brittany had cruelly said , ' i was f * * king her , when i did n't even care about her . ' \\n▁ like most things about me , it could n't have been farther from the truth and also like most things about me , it could n't have been more readily accepted from the students at sheridan high . \\n▁ more than a few stared at us as we walked down the hall , shaking their head at me and whispering . \\n▁ now , not only was i a drunk , i was a louse too . \\n▁ perfect . \\n▁ just what i always wanted to be when i grew up . \\n▁ i kept my head down , stayed out of conversations , and ignored the bustle and buzzing around me . \\n▁ besides sawyer , i ignored most everything and i was getting exceptionally good at it . \\n▁ i also had n't opened up any more in my counseling sessions . \\n▁ i was halfway through my treatment , and figured i only had to show up for the next few weeks and things would get back to normal , well , my normal anyway . \\n▁ mrs . ryans seemed to notice that i was shutting down and shifted her topics accordingly . \\n▁ she talked more about the incident that got me there , trying to get me to talk about josh 's involvement , which i would n't , and trying to get me to tell her what i 'd been feeling during the incident . \\n▁ that had taken me back at first . \\n▁ i mean , i was high , i was n't really feeling anything . \\n▁ but then i realized that was n't true , most of my feelings , beside the unfortunate come - on to ms . reynolds , had been about sawyer . \\n▁ i made the mistake of mentioning that to mrs . ryans , or beth , as she still kept trying to get me to call her , and opened a new portal in my head for her to dig through - my relationship with sawyer . \\n▁ i gave her the standard ` we 're just friends ' speech , but she did n't seem to buy it . \\n▁ it probably did n't help that she purposely kept an ear on the gossip around school and had undoubtedly heard about the nastiness that swirled around us . \\n▁ i did n't know what to say about that . \\n▁ i mean , we were just friends and the rumors were way off . \\n▁ but a nagging part of me remembered kissing her , remembered her lips on mine and wondered . \\n▁ it could n't be more than friendship though , not with my continued involvement with lil -lrb- who was still avoiding me -rrb- , but i did n't mention that to mrs . ryans . \\n▁ she 'd probably lock me up in a padded room or something , and sawyer and i were complicated enough without bringing my special brand of crazy into it . \\n▁ sawyer had started hanging out at my house every day after school , which was becoming the highlight of my day . \\n▁ it was n't as if we did n't see each other all the time , but there was something about being alone in my house , away from the scrutiny of the student body . \\n▁ it was relaxing and we let our guards down a little . \\n▁ we talked and laughed and watched movies and sometimes , if her parents let her stay late enough , she even let me make her my hot pocket dinner specialty . \\n▁ we did n't talk about anything overly deep , nothing about her secret , nothing about mine , but we talked about the rumors at school and the torments of will and josh and brittany . \\n▁ we were bonded already , but going through that chaos together , i do n't know , it bonded us even tighter . \\n▁ i felt surer of her than anyone , besides my mom , of course . \\n▁ and we were comfortable together . \\n▁ we 'd stretch out on the couch , my long legs taking up all the cushions , hers flopped causally over mine as we cuddled up under a blanket to watch a movie she 'd rented - one that i 'd approved first . \\n▁ we were lying that way , my arms wrapped around her as she stretched in front of me on the edge of the couch , my head back against the armrest , watching one of the xxunk , when my eyes started to drift closed . \\n▁ fully content and happy with her in my grip , i let myself relax into sleep … the sound of water falling filled my head , lifting my awareness . \\n▁ each drop felt like a gong going off in my brain it was so loud , or maybe that was because everything else was so silent . \\n▁ i was n't sure where i was for a moment and could n't remember what had just happened . \\n▁ all i was aware of , was the dripping sound of rain on vinyl and metal , and then slowly , i became aware of the rushing sound of water pouring down glass . \\n▁ i shifted and opened my eyes . \\n▁ immediately , i inhaled a sharp breath and my vision clouded , as pain vibrated through my skull . \\n▁ i brought a hand to the side of my head and felt the blood there . \\n▁ then i remembered where i was and what had happened . \\n▁ i was in the smashed remains of darren 's car . \\n▁ we 'd just gone over the embankment and i 'd had a rough ride down the steep hill , ending with a painful smack against the side window . \\n▁ i remembered that solid hit , felt the remembered pain of my head xxunk back against the glass ; my neck remembered that too . \\n▁ but my window had remained intact and , beside the smear of blood on the side of my skull and the pain screaming throughout my jolted body , i was alive . \\n▁ miraculously , i was alive . \\n▁ my eyes refocused on the water streaming down the windshield like a surging river . \\n▁ the sudden downpour was still streaming hard around us . \\n▁ wait … us … my hazy brain struggled to remember that i was n't the only one in the car . \\n▁ i remembered lillian hitting her head hard against her window , and wondered if that had hurt her , as much as it had hurt me . \\n▁ carefully , i reached my hand out for her . \\n▁ in the darkness of the dim lights from the dash , i could only see the basic outline of her body , slumped against the passenger side door . \\n▁ ` ` lil ? '' \\n▁ my hand brushed her shoulder but she did n't move at the contact . \\n▁ ` ` lil ? '' \\n▁ i carefully unbuckled my seatbelt and , even though every muscle in my chest and h * ps protested , i moved as close to her as i could in our bucket seats . \\n▁ ` ` baby , talk to me . '' \\n▁ as my vision improved more , i glanced back at the empty rear seat , the open door , where i could just barely make out the scraggly underbrush and shadowy trees , before they disappeared into the dark thickness of night . \\n▁ i remembered darren and sammy 's unbuckled bodies bursting through that door , the force of their impact breaking the inferior metal of the latch . \\n▁ where were they outside ? \\n▁ were they okay ? \\n▁ god , please let them be okay . \\n▁ my head throbbed and my heart raced as i turned back to lillian . \\n▁ ` ` lil , did you see where darren and sammy went ? \\n▁ lil ? '' \\n▁ when she still did n't respond to me , i brought my hand to her cheek , her cold cheek . \\n▁ concerned , i finally noticed the glass around her still body , her head resting against the boulder protruding through it , the slick wetness of her blood on the rock , turning it black in the darkness . \\n▁ wind was coming through the shattered window , bringing rain with it , dampening lil 's blouse and shorts and washing the blood down her arms . \\n▁ so much blood . \\n▁ flashes of her head smacking that stone assaulted me . \\n▁ she 'd hit it so hard . \\n▁ her fragile , fragile head had hit it so hard . \\n▁ there was so much blood … my heart in my throat , speech barely still possible , i turned her face gently to look in her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` lillian , baby ? \\n▁ please … answer me … '' her head offered no resistance and twisted easily in my grasp . \\n▁ my wide eyes locked onto hers , but it was too late , no one was there to look back at me … i woke with a start , screaming . \\n▁ i had been in a cold , dimly lit car in dark woods , the sound of rain all around me , but now i was in a warm , dry , and brightly lit room , lying down on a soft couch , with a tv flickering in the background , playing the end of the movie i could n't remember . \\n▁ i was n't registering that a dream was fading from me , and hopelessly confused , i had no idea where i was and what was real . \\n▁ still sobbing , i clung to the last remnants of my nightmare . \\n▁ ` ` no , no , no . \\n▁ lil , talk to me ! \\n▁ please … please do n't be … '' hands and arms and hair flew around me , taking me into a tight embrace . \\n▁ soothing sounds entered my ear as i broke down into remembered sobs . \\n▁ lil 's eyes - those beautiful , loving , pale blue eyes - empty … vacant … dead . \\n▁ i sobbed even harder , gasping for air . \\n▁ ` ` the rain … i could n't stop … so much water … i could n't stop … the rock … oh god , her head … so much blood … there 's so much blood … i do n't know what to do … '' ` ` it 's alright , lucas … let it go . \\n▁ it was a dream … you 're safe . '' \\n▁ it was a dream . \\n▁ i was safe . \\n▁ i recognized then , that i was safe on the couch , wrapped securely in sawyer 's arms and not back there again . \\n▁ but she was wrong , it was n't just a dream , it was a memory and she was n't safe . \\n▁ none of them had been . \\n▁ my hands cinched around her waist as i buried my head in her shoulder , and continued my wracking , tortured crying . \\n▁ ` ` god , sawyer , why wo n't this ever stop ? \\n▁ i just want it to stop , '' i sputtered between my tears . \\n▁ i felt her fingers wiping some tears from my face and when my sobbing subsided , i pulled back to search her eyes , for comfort or maybe for hope . \\n▁ she cupped my cheek lightly as we locked gazes . \\n▁ hers were moist and concerned , as empathetic as eyes could get . \\n▁ i reached up to grab her cheek and we held each other 's faces as a few more tears fell from me silently . \\n▁ swallowing , i rested my head against hers . \\n▁ ` ` i just want it to stop . '' \\n▁ i leaned up so our noses were resting side by side ; my heart was thudding in my ears . \\n▁ ` ` please … just make it stop . '' \\n▁ sawyer 's breath was fast on my face through her parted lips and i found myself matching her pace . \\n▁ not thinking of anything but pushing aside this grief , i found her mouth . \\n▁ she gasped as our lips met : soft , wet and slightly salty from so many of my tears . \\n▁ ` ` please … make it stop , '' i muttered around our lips . \\n▁ her breath was still fast against my skin and her hand inched up to weave into my hair . \\n▁ she let out a soft noise , and the lingering pain of my nightmare faded as her reaction to me stirred something deep inside , something i 'd thought was so buried it would never resurface in waking life . \\n▁ the warmth of desire flooded through me and my hand slid around to her neck , pulling her into me . \\n▁ our lips parted and my tongue lightly slid into her , brushing up against hers . \\n▁ she moaned and an ache went straight through me , blocking out all remnants of my vicious memory . \\n▁ she tasted sweet , like the watermelon jolly rancher she 'd been sucking on earlier . \\n▁ it was indescribably good and i wanted to taste more . \\n▁ i angled my mouth differently and deepened our connection , my hands twisting into her dark locks . \\n▁ she moaned softly again and the slight ache shifted to an almost painful need . \\n▁ i needed her . \\n▁ i 'd always emotionally needed her … but this , this was entirely different . \\n▁ keeping her mouth close to me , i shifted her from our side - by - side position , so that her back was flush to the cushions . \\n▁ never breaking the motion of our lips , i leaned over her , shifting more of my body on top of her . \\n▁ her fingers dropped from my hair to run down my back and my body shivered in response . \\n▁ she made a soft noise in her throat and wrapped her legs around mine as i carefully adjusted my entire body over the top of hers , the blanket that had been draped over us , dropping to the floor . \\n▁ the need surging through me , overran my commonsense , and before i could analyze what we were doing , i was pressing the most sensitive part of my body against the most sensitive part of hers . \\n▁ i was hard , i was ready , and i was aching so bad my legs were slightly shaking . \\n▁ she gasped at the feel of me and her fingers clutched at my back when we connected . \\n▁ i groaned at the feel of her and moved my lips to her neck . \\n▁ while i placed deep kisses up her neck to her ear , we started moving together intimately . \\n▁ it was the most incredible thing i 'd felt -lrb- while being awake -rrb- in a long while , and it did n't take long for our movements to become more urgent , along with our breath . \\n▁ it was almost like my earlier despair had crumbled the dam between us , and we were finally letting the weeks of pent - up attraction spill over into our lips and bodies . \\n▁ our desire to connect was an almost frantic one , with our fingers lightly tugging , and teasingly pulling at our clothing , while our h * ps moved in perfect , simulated rhythm . \\n▁ she sucked on my neck , her teeth lightly grazing my skin while my hands slid up under her shirt to feel the softness of her stomach , the hardness of her n * * ples through her bra . \\n▁ she ran her hands under my shirt and up my back , the feel of her fingernails along my bare muscles sending electricity straight down my body , making me throb with the need to release . \\n▁ i hissed in a sharp breath and pushed harder against her , wishing it was more . \\n▁ our mouths met again , our tongues searching the other out , and each break of our lips brought a ragged breath or a soft groan . \\n▁ i heard myself mutter ` ` more '' and ` ` please '' . \\n▁ i heard her suck in a groaning breath and utter my name . \\n▁ i 'd never heard so much passion and desire leaked into the syllables of that word . \\n▁ it crumbled me . \\n▁ driven by pure desperation and need , my hands slid down her body and tugged at her jeans , wanting them off , wanting that barrier between us gone . \\n▁ ` ` please … i need … more . \\n▁ closer … please , closer . '' \\n▁ my words were breathless , coming in pants between our fiery kisses . \\n▁ every inch of me felt electrified , oversensitive , and every rub , moan , and moment of flesh on flesh seared me … but i still needed more . \\n▁ she whimpered and groaned my name , followed by her own pleas for more , and then her fingers moved between us , and stilling my hips , she unzipped her jeans . \\n▁ my heart pounding , our lips never stopping , i felt her push them down , just passed her hips , and then her fingers reached over to unzip mine . \\n▁ ` ` oh god , please , '' i muttered , as i helped her position mine the same . \\n▁ with my erection pushing against my shorts , freed from the restraint of one barrier of clothing , i resettled on her thighs . \\n▁ her hands slid around to grab my hips , guiding me where she most needed me . \\n▁ with a ragged cry , her whole body arched against me as we pressed against each other , unimpeded by the thick fabric of our denims . \\n▁ i bit my lip and groaned heavily , feeling the warmth of her body , as the thin materials separating us slid together . \\n▁ i could feel a faint trace of dampness on her underwear as the edge of my hardness , passed over the edge of her softness . \\n▁ it was bliss . \\n▁ a bliss i did n't know i could still feel while being conscious . \\n▁ vague cries and gasps and muttered pleas for more filled my ears , some from her , some from me . \\n▁ it was so easy to be with her like this , that i could n't remember why we 'd never done this before . \\n▁ i could n't even think about all the lines of friendship we were crossing . \\n▁ i could n't think of anything , really . \\n▁ my mind had shut off awhile ago and only sensation , desire and instinct drove me . \\n▁ her own out of control needs seemed to be driving her as well . \\n▁ in one fast move and arch of her back , her hands went to her h * ps and she pushed her jeans down farther . \\n▁ my breath hitched with the anticipation of where this might go , of where i wanted it to go , and then i hastily helped her scrunch the bulky material all the way off her legs . \\n▁ with her jeans no longer restricting us , i settled more firmly in - between her thighs and pressed directly against her . \\n▁ ` ` oh , sawyer … god , yes , '' i muttered , as i was finally able to completely press my full length up against her . \\n▁ i could definitely feel the warmth of her moisture on me this way , her readiness for me , for this , and i groaned heavily as her legs clamped around mine . \\n▁ my heart surged and my breath could barely keep pace as our h * ps found a rhythm that was natural and appealing , and felt so much more connected than how we physically were . \\n▁ with a loud cry , her head dropped back on the cushions and her hands ran back up my spine . \\n▁ she started to pant in an intoxicating rhythm and her hands came up to tangle in my hair . \\n▁ i watched her face intently , knowing she was close to coming and , oh god , how i wanted to come with her . \\n▁ my breath came in a quicker pant as i pushed harder and faster against her . \\n▁ she muttered my name over and over , followed by a faint ` ` do n't stop '' and closed her eyes as her body stiffened , and the beginnings of ecstasy washed over her . \\n▁ i wanted more . \\n▁ i wanted to stop grinding against her . \\n▁ i wanted to pull down her underwear and slip inside her . \\n▁ i wanted to feel her coming around me , while i came inside of her . \\n▁ i 'd never gone that far before with anyone , but i suddenly wanted it more than i wanted the air i was gasping for . \\n▁ i imagined how that would feel - her body wrapped around me : warm , wet , tight … she cried out and clenched my back hard as her cli * * x intensified . \\n▁ a moment of desperation washed over me as i moved against her ceaselessly , grabbing her h * ps and pulling her into me , as i unconsciously started shifting her underwear down . \\n▁ i wanted to come inside her so bad . \\n▁ i wanted to come so bad . \\n▁ and then , suddenly , and much to my surprise … i did . \\n▁ my fingers curled around the edges of her panties , twisting them , and i dropped my head to her shoulder . \\n▁ she pulled me tight to her , a long cry escaping me as the orgasm ripped through my body . \\n▁ she ran her hands through my hair as a chorus of ` ` oh god '' ran through my head and surely followed out of my mouth . \\n▁ i panted in her ear , struggling to control my breath , while she ran a hand tenderly down my back and whispered my name . \\n▁ it was hearing her lovingly say my name that snapped reality back into me . \\n▁ oh , fuck … no . \\n▁ what did i just let happen ? \\n▁ what did i just do ? \\n▁ ugh , and kind of all over her . \\n▁ did i just ruin everything ? \\n▁ frozen in terror , i remained on top of her , my head glued to her shoulder , until both of our breaths returned to normal . \\n▁ feeling genuine fear , i lifted my head to look at her . \\n▁ we stared at each other with almost frozen in shock faces . \\n▁ he had n't had sex , technically , but it felt like we just had . \\n▁ we 'd been so connected and needy , almost desperate with how much we 'd wanted each other . \\n▁ and i 'd wanted so much more than just coming in my shorts . \\n▁ i 'd wanted her in a way i 'd never wanted anyone but lillian . \\n▁ thinking of lil made icy guilt flash right through me . \\n▁ this would kill lil the next time i saw her … and she 'd know ; i could n't keep anything from my friends . \\n▁ they knew what i knew … and they 'd all know about this . \\n▁ i imagined lillian would be crushed . \\n▁ finally , feeling horrid and guilty , and a little gross , i lifted off of her . \\n▁ ` ` i should … i ' m gon na … i 'll be back in a minute . '' \\n▁ she only nodded as i stood up and adjusted my jeans . \\n▁ avoiding looking at her again , i went to my room . \\n▁ i changed my underwear and cleaned myself up ; luckily most of the mess appeared to have stayed with me . \\n▁ throwing on a pair of sweats that were lying on my floor , i ran a hand through my hair and sighed noisily . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ if i had n't been misleading before … i definitely was now . \\n▁ why did i let that get so carried away ? \\n▁ why did i even start that , when i suspected she had real feelings for me ? \\n▁ i thought of my dream . \\n▁ i thought of my despair and my overwhelming need to make it end . \\n▁ i sighed as the answer struck me - i 'd needed the release . \\n▁ i 'd been selfish , and taken something from her that i was pretty sure she 'd let me have . \\n▁ i closed my eyes as i put my hand on the door handle , momentarily thanking my sudden orgasm from stopping me from going all the way with her . \\n▁ i was n't sure if she 'd have let that happen or not … but i had the feeling she would have . \\n▁ because she likes me , because she cares about me … for some odd reason . \\n▁ i hoped she was n't hurt by what just happened , but i did n't see how she could n't be . \\n▁ god , now i really was a louse . \\n▁ sighing , i opened my door and prepared to face her . \\n▁ shaking my head , i wondered how things could change so fast . \\n▁ in one night , i 'd managed to hurt the two women that mattered most to me . \\n▁ i 'd betrayed lil and misled sawyer even more . \\n▁ i wished i could redo the entire day . \\n▁ hell , if i was wishing for xxunk , then i wished i could rewind time all the way to that night . \\n▁ i walked back out to the living room , where she was sitting quietly on the couch , perfectly put back together and playing with the ring on her thumb . \\n▁ i sighed softly at seeing her nervous habit return and she looked up at me when she heard the noise . \\n▁ i moved to sit beside her , keeping as much distance between us that i could , without offending her . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer … '' oh god , i did n't want to have to say this … ` ` i ' m … i ' m really sorry … about … that . '' \\n▁ she flushed with color and nodded , studying the floor . \\n▁ i swallowed and felt my cheeks heating . \\n▁ i hated this . \\n▁ ` ` do you want to talk about it ? '' \\n▁ i really hoped she said no , and we could just pretend none of this ever happened . \\n▁ she looked up at me with analyzing eyes and i wondered if my thoughts were all over my face . \\n▁ they must have been , for after a moment of contemplation she finally shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i should … it 's getting late , i should go . '' \\n▁ i ran a hand through my hair and nodded as she stood up . \\n▁ i stood up next to her and debated grabbing her hand , or putting mine on her shoulder , or even hugging her , but everything felt weird and contradictory , so i did n't do anything . \\n▁ ` ` okay … um … i 'll see you tomorrow morning then ? '' \\n▁ i did n't mean for it to come out like a question , but it did . \\n▁ she nodded , her mind clearly deep in thought , and made her way to the door , where she grabbed her bag and jacket . \\n▁ i silently watched her slip them on and place her hand on the door . \\n▁ my heart squeezed at the thought of the strain i 'd placed between us ; we 'd been so perfect . \\n▁ she turned back to look at me with her hand still on the knob . \\n▁ ` ` goodnight , lucas . '' \\n▁ ` ` goodnight , sawyer , '' i whispered . \\n▁ and i ' m really sorry . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; throwing on a weak smile , i shook my head again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine … bad hot pocket . '' \\n▁ i shrugged and her face twisted in parental compassion , and probably a little bit of guilt for what i constantly fed myself with . \\n▁ her hand came up to my cheek , cupping it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , luc . \\n▁ i really should n't buy that stuff for you . '' \\n▁ i sighed that my stupid cover was making her feel bad about herself . \\n▁ i seemed to be really good at making her feel bad about herself . \\n▁ i hated that . \\n▁ i stood up , feeling a little wobbly , and put a hand on her shoulder , drawing her in for a quick hug . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine … really . \\n▁ it was just a weird moment , but it 's gone now . '' \\n▁ i hoped it was gone for awhile . \\n▁ she returned my hug , her face never relaxing out of concern . \\n▁ ` ` oh … alright . \\n▁ do you want to stay home ? \\n▁ should i call the school ? '' \\n▁ i seriously considered that . \\n▁ but … as terrified as i was to see sawyer again , avoiding her for a day would probably only make this , thing , between us worse . \\n▁ no , i needed to get this awkwardness behind us so we could have our amazing friendship back again . \\n▁ i relied on that friendship too much . \\n▁ shaking my head , i reiterated , ` ` no , i really am fine . '' \\n▁ she finally conceded , reaching up to kiss my cheek before leaving me to shower away my troubles . \\n▁ or try to anyway . \\n▁ the soothing feeling of hot water and sudsy bubbles sliding over skin , only did so much to ease the soul . \\n▁ but being clean , and eventually dressed , did lighten the pit in my stomach . \\n▁ now it was only a typical bundle of nerves and not the radiation - enhanced version i 'd had upon waking . \\n▁ sipping coffee with mom in the kitchen later , i waited for sawyer to appear . \\n▁ and waited … and waited . \\n▁ i started to worry that she was going to avoid me . \\n▁ she 'd only said she 'd see me this morning … she did n't say she 'd come get me . \\n▁ i 'd just gotten so used to being picked up , i guess i kind of expected it now . \\n▁ pretty selfish of me really . \\n▁ mom looked at her watch and frowned . \\n▁ another few minutes and i 'd have to take the bus or be late . \\n▁ god , i really did not want to climb back on that damn bus . \\n▁ i shifted in my chair and spun the coffee cup in my hands , trying to appear unworried . \\n▁ surely she would n't ditch me ? \\n▁ ` ` um … luc ? '' \\n▁ mom began , glancing at her watch again . \\n▁ ` ` she 'll be here , '' i muttered , more to myself than my mom . \\n▁ ` ` well , she 's never late and you 're going to be , if she does n't get here soon … '' i stopped fidgeting and stared at my mom , meeting her gaze . \\n▁ ` ` she 'll be here . '' \\n▁ my voice sounded confident , but i was n't . \\n▁ how badly had i damaged us ? \\n▁ mom stood and ruffled my hair , grabbing my coffee cup and walking over to the sink . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she said as she rinsed out our cups . \\n▁ she glanced at her watch again and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , luc , but i have a. . . \\n▁ meeting before work . '' \\n▁ she shrugged and looked really guilty . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't give you a ride today , honey … if she does n't make it . '' \\n▁ i stood up and threw on an unworried smile . \\n▁ walking over to her , i slung my arms around her and brightly proclaimed . \\n▁ ` ` have a good day , mom … and do n't worry , she 'll be here . '' \\n▁ she sighed and cupped my cheek as her eyes took me in . \\n▁ i waited patiently for her to finish and then she grabbed her purse , kissed my cheek and left me alone in the kitchen … with that gargantuan knot making a reappearance . \\n▁ i paced for a few minutes and then decided the enclosed space was just making me feel worse . \\n▁ the bus had gone by not long after my mom had left and my options for getting to school on time were dwindling . \\n▁ i suppose i could run there … if i really needed to . \\n▁ or maybe i 'd just skip first period . \\n▁ i stepped outside and breathed in the crisp , cool december air . \\n▁ it had rained during the night and everything was slick and damp . \\n▁ deep puddles filled in a low spot on our lawn and the edge of the road by the sidewalk streamed like a narrow river . \\n▁ leaves dripped their stores of excess water and the whole world felt heavy and damp . \\n▁ i was not looking forward to being in this . \\n▁ just as i mentally accepted that she really was n't coming , a familiar camaro pulled into the drive . \\n▁ a frazzled looking sawyer waved at me through the window , urging me to get my butt in the car already . \\n▁ i startled from where i 'd been stupidly staring at her , and briskly walked to her car , getting in and shutting the door behind me . \\n▁ she was off before my door had even finished closing . \\n▁ ` ` sorry i ' m late , '' she muttered as she sped down the wet streets , the sound of the rain splashing up under her car nearly as loud as the roar of the car 's engine . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay … i ' m just glad you came . '' \\n▁ i cringed at my choice of words and stared out the window . \\n▁ the town sped by and i clutched the handle of the door , part nerves from driving so fast in the rain , part nerves from the tension i felt in the car . \\n▁ ` ` why would n't i ? '' \\n▁ she shot back , a flatness to her tone that i did n't like hearing . \\n▁ she 'd ignored the xxunk of what i 'd said , so i ignored it as well and looked back at her . \\n▁ she focused hard on the road , too hard for it to not be intentional . \\n▁ her hands were white as she gripped the wheel and she was breathing shallowly though parted lips . \\n▁ i sighed at her obvious discomfort . \\n▁ i did n't want us like this . \\n▁ just as i was about to speak , to apologize for my behavior last night , we reached the school lot and she parked , shut off the car , and opened her door , all in practically one move . \\n▁ i had trouble adjusting to her swiftness , and scrambled to pick my bag off the floor and open my own door . \\n▁ by the time i 'd successfully done both , she was ten paces in front of me , walking fast towards the main building . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer , wait , '' i called as i hurried to catch up . \\n▁ the lot was full of cars , and no one was around . \\n▁ we only had a few moments before the bell was going to ring ; we 'd barely have time to get there and we definitely did n't have time for the conversation i felt we needed to have . \\n▁ i suddenly got the feeling that that was exactly what she 'd planned this morning . \\n▁ her being late was n't an accident . \\n▁ she said nothing and did n't slow her pace , but my long legs caught up to her easily enough and we made the final steps to the doors in an uncomfortable silence . \\n▁ i watched the way her hair streamed behind her , unrestrained by any clips or rubber bands . \\n▁ i remembered that silky length wrapped in my fingers yesterday , remembered her breath in my ear … remembered the noises she 'd made and how she 'd clutched my back when she came beneath me . \\n▁ the way she 'd held me tight when i came . \\n▁ she cleared her throat and gestured to the door and i woke from my thoughts , my face heating as i realized we were at english already . \\n▁ in my spacing out , i 'd missed the entire trip up here . \\n▁ i pulled open the door as i let my heated memories fade ; i really needed to not think about her like that . \\n▁ ms . reynolds smiled at our joint entrance and the bell rang right as we sat in our seats . \\n▁ ignoring the people around me and ms . reynolds xxunk asking how everyone did on their last assignments , a five page paper we were supposed to write on the person who inspired us most -lrb- i think she was trying to prep us for our college essays that we 'd be starting to really focus on soon -rrb- , i stared at sawyer . \\n▁ unlike most days , sawyer did n't look back at me . \\n▁ she 'd slung my letterman 's jacket over the back of her chair and was chewing on the end of a pencil , listening to the teacher intently . \\n▁ nothing in the slump of her body or the casual way she ran her thumb over the edge of her notebook showed any signs of turmoil , but every once in a while , just her eyes would flick over to me , and i knew . \\n▁ i knew she was making herself not return my unblinking gaze . \\n▁ she was making herself kind of ignore me . \\n▁ when nothing had changed halfway through class , i could n't take it anymore . \\n▁ i needed to talk to her ; i needed to know if we were okay . \\n▁ it was unfortunately a silent reading period , and everyone had their nose in a book . \\n▁ it was too quiet for me to whisper a conversation to her . \\n▁ ms . reynolds was preoccupied with reading our essays at her desk , her red pen flying across the papers as she worked , and aside from the rustle of turning pages among the students , she was making the only noise in the room . \\n▁ sawyer was twirling a lock of hair around her finger as she read quietly and i stared at my book without even seeing the tiny typed letters on the page . \\n▁ wanting to curse for having to resort to fifth grade measures , i grabbed my pencil and quietly tore a sheet out of the notebook still open on my desk . \\n▁ i wrote a question in it and folded it as silently as i could . \\n▁ i extended my note enclosed hand out to her , but her eyes remained on her book . \\n▁ worried that she 'd just plain blow me off , i coughed and exaggerated the ` take it ' motion with my hand . \\n▁ she finally pulled her eyes away from whatever fascinating novel she was reading , and stared at my hand . \\n▁ she flicked a glance to my eyes and i could clearly see the reluctance on her face . \\n▁ i gestured again , my brows drawing together as i worried . \\n▁ with a soft sigh she finally reached over and took the note from my hand . \\n▁ she unfolded it while i bit my lip . \\n▁ with a shake of her head , she picked up her pencil and wrote something next to my question . \\n▁ then she refolded it and handed it to me , not looking at me . \\n▁ i took it immediately . \\n▁ in my messy scrawl i 'd written , ` ` are we okay ? '' \\n▁ in slanted , elegant script she 'd responded with , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped and i looked over at her . \\n▁ that 's it , that 's all i get ? \\n▁ a one syllable answer to cover all the tension between us ? \\n▁ she met my eye and i gestured to the paper and shook my head disbelievingly at her . \\n▁ she shrugged and started to turn back to her book . \\n▁ irritated , i wrote , ` ` are you avoiding me ? '' \\n▁ deciding to not leave her with another yes / no question , i added , ` ` what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ she took the note and read it , responding with , ` ` no . \\n▁ nothing . '' \\n▁ sighing , and wanting to scream in frustration , i heavily wrote , ` ` talk to me ! '' \\n▁ i nearly ripped the paper i wrote it so hard . \\n▁ i harshly handed it to her and stared while she sighed and wrote a reply . \\n▁ it was a long one and i relaxed . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what to say to you . \\n▁ last night should n't have happened for several reasons , but i ' m not trying to avoid you . \\n▁ i promise . '' \\n▁ i frowned down at the paper and glanced back at her . \\n▁ she was worrying her lip and twirling the ring on her thumb . \\n▁ i frowned more as i wrote , ` ` you seem mad at me . \\n▁ are you ? \\n▁ do you hate me for what i did ? '' \\n▁ her brows drew to a point when she read that . \\n▁ shaking her head she replied with , ` ` no , i do n't hate you . \\n▁ i ' m mad at myself . \\n▁ i should n't have let that happen . '' \\n▁ incredulous , i wrote back , ` ` you ? \\n▁ i ' m the one that started it . \\n▁ i ' m the one that kissed you . '' \\n▁ as i wrote those words , i really hoped our note did n't get confiscated and read out loud . \\n▁ ms . reynolds really was n't the type to embarrass students like that though . \\n▁ now , if we were in mr . varner 's class … ` ` you were hurting . \\n▁ you needed … something . \\n▁ i should have pushed you away , found another way to comfort you . \\n▁ i ' m mad at myself . \\n▁ i know better than that … '' i did n't know what she meant by that last part , but i was so stunned that she was angry at her own conduct , that i ignored it . \\n▁ i did n't blame her for getting carried away when i practically attacked her , especially when i was pretty sure she had feelings for me . \\n▁ it was all my fault . \\n▁ i was the one with the lapse in judgment . \\n▁ i was the one being misleading , again . \\n▁ i told her as much and she sighed and stared at me a moment . \\n▁ i bit my lip as her wrist performed the delicate act of cursive writing . \\n▁ ` ` you were … impaired . \\n▁ i understand . \\n▁ will you please stop apologizing ? \\n▁ you 're just making me feel worse . '' \\n▁ i understood what she meant by impaired . \\n▁ she did n't mean drunk or high , she meant overwhelmed by grief . \\n▁ i suppose i was . \\n▁ it still did n't excuse what i 'd done and i felt like falling at her feet and begging her forgiveness . \\n▁ i just wanted things to return to normal . \\n▁ i hastily scrawled back , ` ` i 'll stop apologizing if you stop being mad at yourself and avoiding me - because you are avoiding me . \\n▁ i just want us back . \\n▁ please ? '' \\n▁ she closed her eyes briefly after she read that . \\n▁ when she opened them to glance at me , they seemed excessively moist . \\n▁ i swallowed when i read her response . \\n▁ ` ` okay . \\n▁ i ' m sorry if i came off that way . \\n▁ i really was just late this morning , but i guess i do feel sort of weird around you , kind of guilty and … angry . \\n▁ i 'll stop . \\n▁ we 'll brush this aside and just be us again . \\n▁ okay ? '' \\n▁ she held her hand out to me as i read the note and i automatically grabbed it . \\n▁ my eyes were overly moist now too . \\n▁ i 'd made her feel guilty and angry . \\n▁ i could n't grasp that the anger she felt was only towards herself . \\n▁ a part of her had to hate me a little . \\n▁ if anything , she had to hate me for pulling back from a relationship with her . \\n▁ i knew she wanted that , well , i was pretty sure anyway . \\n▁ but i was … taken . \\n▁ i was with lil and we could only be friends . \\n▁ i wished i could tell her that . \\n▁ instead , with one hand i wrote , ` ` so , we 're okay then ? '' \\n▁ she took it , read it and nodded her head , smiling at me . \\n▁ i relaxed back in my seat and smiled halfheartedly . \\n▁ i wanted to believe that , i really did , but a part of me just could n't . \\n▁ i held her hand for the rest of class , praying that it was true . \\n▁ the rest of the day went by with an odd sort of tension between us . \\n▁ a tension that anyone not in the loop of what happened last night would ever notice . \\n▁ outwardly we were the same . \\n▁ we walked to classes together . \\n▁ we talked about trivial topics with our heads close together . \\n▁ i even held her hand during break , needing to feel close to her , even if eyes were watching . \\n▁ no one else probably noticed the strain in our faces , the slight edge of discomfort in our voices and the almost panicked way we gripped each other . \\n▁ and no one else definitely noticed the quiet lunch we had in her car . \\n▁ no one else was there for that , and the odd feeling between us only intensified in that small space . \\n▁ and , of course , in the closeness of confinement , my mind had started wandering to touching her again . \\n▁ as she ate half of my sandwich , i watched her lick some crumbs off her upper lip . \\n▁ i instantly imagined that tongue along my upper lip . \\n▁ as she leaned over and her hair fell over her shoulder , i imagined that curtain of dark hair enclosing our faces , brushing against my shoulder . \\n▁ as her fingers wrapped around her water bottle , i imagined them wrapped around me . \\n▁ and as she tilted her head up to take a long drink from that bottle , i imagined … far more intimate acts . \\n▁ i knew i was n't helping matters any , and turned away from her to stare out the window . \\n▁ my body had started responding to the fantasies i 'd allowed it and i berated myself for mentally going there . \\n▁ it was wrong on so many levels - wrong to lil , wrong to sawyer . \\n▁ but still , you can only control what your body does and feels so much . \\n▁ some things are just instinct . \\n▁ i was so lost in my inner fog for the remainder of that long day , that i barely noticed any of it . \\n▁ by the time sawyer and i were parting ways , her for purity club , me for counseling , i could n't remember a single face i 'd seen or assignment i 'd been given . \\n▁ the only thing in my head was sawyer … and guilt … and confusion . \\n▁ as i sat down in my chair and stared at my hands , i started wondering if counseling was the best place for me . \\n▁ i started wondering if maybe i should finally open up to mrs . ryans . \\n▁ just the thought brought back super - knot though . \\n▁ still staring at my hands , i heard her merrily greet me . \\n▁ i returned the greeting and my lip lifted to a tiny smile when she asked me to call her beth . \\n▁ i studied the lines and creases of my fingers as silence filled around us . \\n▁ i wanted to say something , but the behemoth in my stomach had me in a strangle hold - i could n't speak . \\n▁ i awkwardly shifted in my chair and concentrated harder on my thumb , mentally outlining the unique lines that only belonged to my skin . \\n▁ mrs . ryans started speaking to me , asking me questions that only required either a nod or shake of my head . \\n▁ she usually started out that way , to loosen me up , i think . \\n▁ no matter my good intentions throughout the day , no matter how much i wanted to talk sometimes , by the time i sat in this chair across from her , my throat always closed up . \\n▁ she seemed to sense that and eased me in for conversations . \\n▁ i 'd been silent a lot lately , but today , i was nearly mute . \\n▁ as half the session went by without so much as a peep from me , and i do n't think i 'd even looked at her yet , she finally sighed and i felt her hand reach over to touch my shoulder . \\n▁ i finally looked up at her with the contact . \\n▁ ` ` i want to help you , lucas , but i ca n't do that if you wo n't talk to me . '' \\n▁ her astonishingly blue eyes seemed to brighten with concern . \\n▁ ` ` please . \\n▁ i ' m used to a little resistance from you , but this … '' she indicated where i was rigidly sitting with my hands fisted in my lap . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't help you if you completely shut down . '' \\n▁ i tried to relax my stance and unknown aches told me i 'd kept my rigid posture for awhile . \\n▁ i had n't even noticed . \\n▁ her pale , red eyebrows drew together as she tilted her head and removed her hand from my shoulder , sitting back in her chair . \\n▁ ` ` things are different today , '' she surmised . \\n▁ ` ` something happened ? '' \\n▁ i stiffened back up as she crept closer to the truth . \\n▁ her eyes took in my response and she spoke in a low voice , ` ` did someone else bother you ? '' \\n▁ she knew i was picked on . \\n▁ she knew someone had even drugged me . \\n▁ i shook my head , that was n't my issue today . \\n▁ she sighed and then a thought seemed to lighten up her speckled cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` is it sawyer , did you have a fight ? '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes and exhaled . \\n▁ part in nervousness that she 'd guessed correctly , part in relief that she 'd guessed correctly . \\n▁ i felt that knot start to loosen and i swallowed noisily a few times , trying to loosen my tongue as well . \\n▁ finally i sputtered , ` ` yes … no … i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i opened my eyes to find her watching me with an elated expression that she tried to keep even . \\n▁ she was excited i was talking , even if i was n't making much sense . \\n▁ she leaned over her desk , her red hair moving over her shoulders as she did so . \\n▁ ` ` can you tell me what happened ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , so she 'd know i was going to respond , and then i mentally made myself relax in my chair . \\n▁ i listened to the quiet jazz she played in the background and noted how everything else in the room was silent . \\n▁ she normally took kids during school hours . \\n▁ i was her exception . \\n▁ she 'd told me once that she stayed late with me so we 'd have more privacy . \\n▁ she was aware that her flimsy japanese screen did little to block out conversations , and she 'd fit me into her life this way in the hopes that i 'd open up to her if no one was around to hear . \\n▁ i swallowed again and hoped i 'd be able to do that today . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ we … i sort of … made out with her … and i ' m really scared . \\n▁ i ' m really scared that i ' ve destroyed our friendship … '' my words were halting , starting and stopping and seeming to take forever in coming out , but she sat patiently and waited for me to be done . \\n▁ she infinitesimally raised her eyebrow at my admission . \\n▁ i 'd sworn up and down in earlier sessions that there was nothing between us and now i 'd let it slip that maybe there was . \\n▁ evening her face she said , ` ` why are you worried about it being destroyed ? \\n▁ you both seem to care about each other . \\n▁ maybe you 're just finally moving closer . \\n▁ that 's natural , lucas . '' \\n▁ i shook my head and wiped my hands on my jeans , ignoring the fluttering sensation in my stomach . \\n▁ ` ` no , we are n't like that . '' \\n▁ i sighed heavily . \\n▁ ` ` well , i ' m pretty sure she likes me , like that . '' \\n▁ i ran a hand through my hair nervously . \\n▁ both dreading and wanting to finish my thought , i whispered , ` ` i was having a weak moment and … i took advantage of that fact . '' \\n▁ i shook my head again , in anger this time . \\n▁ my voice heated as self loathing ran through me . \\n▁ ` ` i needed the comfort and i stole it from her … and i sort of feel like a bastard . '' \\n▁ i waited for her to agree with me , my head down . \\n▁ that 's exactly what i 'd felt like today - a bastard . \\n▁ one of those guys that jerked girls around simply because they could . \\n▁ i felt horrid . \\n▁ she surprised me by instead saying , ` ` you have feelings for her as well , you know . '' \\n▁ i looked up , already shaking my head at her , but she continued , ` ` everything you ' ve told me about her … '' she shook her head , her curls bouncing merrily , ` ` that 's not a man describing a friend , that 's a man describing the woman he loves . '' \\n▁ i shook my head harshly and it spilled out before i could stop it . \\n▁ ` ` no , i ca n't like her . \\n▁ lillian 's my girlfriend and i do n't want to hurt her . '' \\n▁ i immediately shut my mouth as i realized what i 'd just said . \\n▁ i could feel my face pale and i begged the fates that she somehow had n't heard that . \\n▁ no such luck . \\n▁ her brows drew together . \\n▁ ` ` lillian ? '' \\n▁ she looked past me , over my shoulder , and i could see pieces of the puzzle , that was me , snapping into place for her . \\n▁ with an expression that clearly said ' i understand you better ' , her eyes came back to me and she asked , ` ` lucas … are you afraid to hurt sawyer , or are you afraid to hurt lillian ? '' \\n▁ ` ` both , '' i whispered , wishing i could vanish . \\n▁ she nodded , like she finally got it . \\n▁ ` ` so , you wo n't let yourself be with sawyer , acknowledge the love you feel for her … because you still feel loyalty to your ex - girlfriend . \\n▁ you 're still bound to her . '' \\n▁ i bristled at that and answered before my head could shout at me to stop . \\n▁ ` ` she 's not my ex ! \\n▁ we 're still together . \\n▁ i still see her and - '' i cut myself off , wishing that earlier knot would return and cinch off my throat . \\n▁ this was exactly why i did n't want to open up to her . \\n▁ i could n't talk about this with her , she 'd think i was nuts . \\n▁ her brows drew together , confused again . \\n▁ ` ` you still … ? \\n▁ what do you mean you still see her ? '' \\n▁ i immediately stood up , needing to get out of there . \\n▁ ` ` i have to go . '' \\n▁ i made to head for the door . \\n▁ she stood up as well , hastily reaching across her desk to grasp my arm , stopping me . \\n▁ ` ` no , stay . \\n▁ please … stay and talk to me . \\n▁ do you still see lillian ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head , tears forming . \\n▁ she 'd put me in a padded cell and pump me full of anti - xxunk if i told her the truth . \\n▁ ` ` no … i. . . \\n▁ no , i know she 's dead . '' \\n▁ her hand ran under my arm to my elbow , supporting me . \\n▁ with a gentle squeeze she asked , ` ` then what do you mean ? '' \\n▁ i hesitated , starting to buckle under the strain of hiding this , and she saw my internal debate . \\n▁ ` ` you can trust me , luc , you can tell me . '' \\n▁ i stepped away , breaking the contact . \\n▁ scared beyond belief , i decided to let it out or maybe it decided for me . \\n▁ ` ` i dream of her and its real … as real as anything in this world . \\n▁ and in that way … we 're still together . '' \\n▁ my voice was shaking and tears dripped to my cheeks as i waited for her to tell me i was crazy . \\n▁ i 'd been backing up while i was speaking and i eventually bumped into the door handle . \\n▁ my hand automatically clutched it , seeking escape . \\n▁ her face fell into sympathy as i twisted the knob . \\n▁ as i pulled open the door she shook her head at me and my body tensed . \\n▁ ` ` luc … oh , lucas … that 's not real . '' \\n▁ i swallowed back the tears and fled into the hallway . \\n▁ i was practically running and wiping tears off my cheeks when i heard her behind me . \\n▁ ` ` luc , wait . \\n▁ please . '' \\n▁ i kept going , fighting the natural instinct i had to obey a request made from an authority figure . \\n▁ i slowed as i made my way to the section of the hall where the purity club was just letting out . \\n▁ feeling panic creep into me , i stopped , not knowing which way to go . \\n▁ i could hear mrs . ryans ' heels clicking up the hall as she caught up from behind me , and i could hear the light laughter of students as they left the now getting packed classroom in front of me . \\n▁ my breath was coming in stuttered pulls , like i 'd just run a marathon and i could feel the burning sensation of a massive barrage of tears starting to form . \\n▁ i was gon na break down ; it was more a question of where than when . \\n▁ sawyer 's black hair entered my vision as she exited the classroom , a big smile on her face as she talked to a young looking blonde girl . \\n▁ she had n't seen me yet , but i was positive that the moment she looked into my eyes , i 'd start to cry . \\n▁ i did n't want to cry again in front of her , especially over lillian . \\n▁ i backed up and ran into mrs . ryans . \\n▁ she looked over at my panicked face staring at sawyer and pulled me into a classroom . \\n▁ i broke down the minute the door closed . \\n▁ she held me and let me cry all over her . \\n▁ i hated it . \\n▁ i hated feeling so weak in front of a teacher - like figure . \\n▁ she only held me close and rubbed my back though , making soothing sounds and not commenting . \\n▁ when i 'd finished , i pulled away from her , wiping my nose on my sleeve and turning my face away from her . \\n▁ i sat on a nearby desk and sniffled , getting my breath and emotions under control . \\n▁ mrs . ryans sat on a desk near me and waited patiently for me to be more put back together . \\n▁ when i was , she quietly said , ` ` lucas … can you talk about her now ? '' \\n▁ i knew which her she meant and the beginning of a sob rose to my throat . \\n▁ i shook my head and looked at her , my eyes begging for the torture to be done for one day . \\n▁ she seemed to understand my expression and nodded . \\n▁ her next words made that sob escape however . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m very proud of you for telling me . \\n▁ i know that was hard . '' \\n▁ as my eyes let more embarrassing tears escape , that i hurriedly brushed away , she brought a hand to my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll leave it for another day , okay ? '' \\n▁ with a shaky exhale , i nodded , a numb sort of relief filling me . \\n▁ relief that the burden of my hidden secret was lifted , relief that she had n't outright called me nuts and relief that i did n't need to open up any more today ; my fresh wound hurt enough . \\n▁ she moved her hand from my cheek to my knee and patted it a couple times . \\n▁ ` ` i do have an assignment for you though . '' \\n▁ with an even shakier voice i muttered , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ she smiled and tilted her head at me . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to take sawyer to the winter dance . '' \\n▁ i shook my head like she 'd just asked me to jump out the window . \\n▁ the winter dance was the last official school function before winter break . \\n▁ it was semi - formal and open to every student . \\n▁ i 'd gone last year with lillian and the others . \\n▁ it had been a fun night with lots of holding and kissing and … ` ` what ? \\n▁ i ca n't … sawyer and i ca n't … '' i sputtered on my words and could n't finish . \\n▁ her lips twisted and a somber look passed her . \\n▁ ` ` this is important for you , lucas . \\n▁ i want you to go . \\n▁ i think sawyer is the best person to go with you , and who you take is ultimately up to you … but i do want you to go , regardless of your escort . '' \\n▁ ` ` but … i do n't dance . '' \\n▁ even i knew that objection was n't going to get me anywhere . \\n▁ she smiled with one corner of her lip . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not about dancing , lucas , and you know that . '' \\n▁ her face got serious again . \\n▁ ` ` it 's about you reconnecting with society , with your peers . \\n▁ it 's about you stopping this shut down . \\n▁ it 's about you living … in this world . '' \\n▁ i bristled at that and pulled away from her hand on my knee . \\n▁ i waited for her to further comment on my dream life , but she did n't . \\n▁ she only held my gaze and i knew we both knew what she was talking about . \\n▁ i shook my head and she sighed , but shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't make you go , lucas … but i do think it would help you . '' \\n▁ she stood up and put a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` think about it . '' \\n▁ her eyes drifted over my worn features . \\n▁ ` ` think about if what you 're doing now … is making anything in your life better . '' \\n▁ her voice was soft and concerned , full of genuine compassion and i found myself nodding . \\n▁ i stayed in that classroom after she left , my body swirling with so many emotions , i could only feel numbness . \\n▁ my chin lifted when i heard the door open . \\n▁ sawyer 's head popped in , looking around . \\n▁ she spotted me still sitting on a desk and walked into the room . \\n▁ ` ` there you are . '' \\n▁ her brows creased together as i stared blankly at her . \\n▁ i was n't sure what i looked like , but i knew how i felt : empty , alone … tired . \\n▁ she sat beside me , not breaking our eye contact . \\n▁ her hand came up to brush some hair off my forehead and she ran her fingers down my cheek , brushing away a tear i had n't even realized was there . \\n▁ her thumb continued stroking my face as we gazed at each other . \\n▁ ` ` tough session ? '' \\n▁ she whispered . \\n▁ i could only swallow and nod in answer . \\n▁ the hardest one yet . \\n▁ with a sigh , she brought her arm around me and pulled me in for a tight hug . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , luc . '' \\n▁ i exhaled as she said the words , feeling like she was apologizing for more than just my meeting with mrs . ryans . \\n▁ feeling the tension between us slip away , i hugged her back just as tight and whispered , ` ` i ' m sorry too . '' \\n▁ she nodded in my shoulder and i knew she knew exactly what i meant by that . \\n▁ she drove me home and stayed with me for awhile , going over our philosophy homework while slyly watching to make sure i was really okay . \\n▁ other than homework , we did n't talk much . \\n▁ i did n't tell her about my session and she did n't ask . \\n▁ we did n't talk any more about what had happened between us ; that was over and dealt with . \\n▁ and i definitely did n't ask her to the dance . \\n▁ it was such a crazy idea that i could n't even entertain it yet . \\n▁ i did n't really want to reconnect with society , with my peers . \\n▁ they did n't want to reconnect with me either . \\n▁ at least the rejection was mutual . \\n▁ i did n't see the point of it , and i did n't see the harm of having a better life in my dreams , crazy as that was . \\n▁ for now , going to a silly high school dance seemed the crazier suggestion and i did n't bring it up around sawyer . \\n▁ dances were apparently in my thoughts when i fell asleep that night though . \\n▁ i blankly looked around at a fully decked out for a dance gymnasium , complete with blue and white crepe paper , generic popular music in the background and a revolving disco ball suspended from the ceiling , throwing sparks of light across the laminated floor . \\n▁ i looked down at myself , taking in the black slacks and white button - down dress shirt . \\n▁ i ran a hand through my hair and felt the product styling it back into more manageable waves . \\n▁ i looked around the empty room , feeling the lonely expanse of it . \\n▁ where was everyone ? \\n▁ the room suddenly felt … thicker . \\n▁ the scent of lilies and vanilla hit me and i closed my eyes , remembering the fragrance lillian used for special occasions . \\n▁ dances , dates , nights when she snuck into my bed to be intimate with me … the memories assaulted me , and i swallowed and sat on the bleacher behind me . \\n▁ panicky nerves shot through me . \\n▁ she was finally reappearing to me . \\n▁ i was about to finally see her again … and she 'd know . \\n▁ she 'd know i was unfaithful to her . \\n▁ she 'd hate me . \\n▁ she 'd finally hate me … and i deserved her hatred . \\n▁ i felt her presence get even closer and my whole body tensed . \\n▁ i could n't do this . \\n▁ i could n't look at her and break her heart , without even having to say a word . \\n▁ her high heeled shoes filled my vision as i regretfully opened my eyes . \\n▁ i swallowed but did n't look up at her , not wanting to see those achingly beautiful pale eyes fill with tears . \\n▁ she was n't just going to let me ignore her though . \\n▁ she squatted down and looked up at me . \\n▁ i avoided looking at her face , my gaze instead going to her dark blue silk dress , the spaghetti straps clinging to her pale shoulders . \\n▁ i swallowed again . \\n▁ ` ` lucas , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i closed my eyes briefly and then made myself look up to hers . \\n▁ her hands stroked my knees as she squatted in front of me , a small smile playing on her peach lips , a trace amount of smoky eye makeup highlighting the brilliant blue irises gazing at me lovingly , only the slightest hint of moisture in them . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , '' i immediately choked out . \\n▁ she shook her head , the tight blonde curls of her intricate up - do bouncing as she did . \\n▁ ` ` do n't , luc … it 's okay . '' \\n▁ a tear dropped to my cheek as i swallowed and spoke the words i was terrified to say . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ i feel like i cheated on you . '' \\n▁ my voice quavered horribly and i swallowed again , looking down at my hands pressing against my stomach . \\n▁ her hands came up to grab mine and i looked back at the hazy image of her in my watery vision . \\n▁ ` ` that 's ridiculous , luc . '' \\n▁ she shook her pale head again . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't cheat on me … , '' she shrugged , ` ` i ' m already gone … '' i shook my head and grabbed her face . \\n▁ ` ` not to me … not to me … '' i brought her lips to mine , needing her comfort . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry . \\n▁ it wo n't happen again , i promise , '' i whispered against her mouth . \\n▁ she pulled back and sighed brokenly . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to do this , lucas . \\n▁ i want you to move forward with sawyer . '' \\n▁ her lips came up to a small smile and i felt my heart seize . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m telling you it 's okay . '' \\n▁ i reached up to stroke her cheek , brushing aside a tear as it spilled from her eye . \\n▁ ` ` then why are you crying ? '' \\n▁ she swallowed , her smile slipping . \\n▁ ` ` just because i know it 's right … does n't mean it 's easy . '' \\n▁ i searched her face , not wanting to listen . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't be with her , lillian … '' she shook her head , like she knew what i was going to say next . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't be with her … because i ' m in love with you . '' \\n▁ i searched her watery eyes as i reverently whispered , ` ` i love … you . '' \\n▁ her eyes closed and tears fell from both of them . \\n▁ ` ` oh , lucas … '' she reopened them , pain and joy clear in her face . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too . '' \\n▁ she leaned in to kiss me and i pulled her tight , never wanting to let her go . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i got out of bed and ran a hand down my face . \\n▁ i would n't take it there again though . \\n▁ i 'd be the friend sawyer deserved and keep my physical distance . \\n▁ i 'd return us to a more normal guy / girl relationship of at least a foot apart at all times . \\n▁ then my hormones would be kept in check and she would n't get hurt anymore . \\n▁ i could at least do that for her . \\n▁ and for lillian . \\n▁ i made my way to the bathroom to shower and shave , all the while thinking of lillian again . \\n▁ i 'd hurt her . \\n▁ she may have tried to stoically brush it off as ` that 's real life and you should embrace it ' , but i could see it in the slight tremor of her lip and the few tears she 'd let slide down her cheek . \\n▁ i 'd abandoned her , betrayed her and she 'd been devastated . \\n▁ i 'd never do that again . \\n▁ i 'd never bring her pain again . \\n▁ i 'd never let her go … we were going to be together forever . \\n▁ as i sat down for my coffee with mom , a smile was still with me and she delighted in seeing it . \\n▁ she xxunk on it and i only told her things were fine . \\n▁ i did n't want to tell her that lillian and i had finally moved up in our romance . \\n▁ she 'd tell me that was impossible and i needed help … etc , etc , etc . . \\n▁ i did n't want to hear it . \\n▁ i felt good today and i was going to keep that feeling , even if that meant being vague or even outright lying to people . \\n▁ sawyer surprised both my mom and me by arriving a few minutes early and coming inside . \\n▁ mom stood up and gave her the chair she 'd been sitting in , then poured her a fresh cup of coffee . \\n▁ sawyer politely thanked her , twisting the ring on her thumb , and my mom leaned back on the counter , beaming at the two of us . \\n▁ mom believed sawyer was making me happy and wanted to foster that , wanted us to be together , or maybe she thought we already were . \\n▁ to a casual observer it did look that way , especially with her still wearing my jacket . \\n▁ but we were n't , and even though she did make me happy , happier than any living person , she was n't the one making me smile softly into my coffee cup . \\n▁ ` ` you seem … better today , '' she said quietly , once we were finally driving to school . \\n▁ i grinned and flicked her disco ball hanging off her rear view mirror . \\n▁ it caught the early morning rays and threw tiny dots of lights across her dashboard . \\n▁ it reminded me of my dream so firmly that i let out a contented sigh and leaned back in my seat . \\n▁ ` ` do i ? '' \\n▁ even i could hear the bounce in my voice and i laughed lightly as i stared off into the window . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i just had a good night . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ her voice was genuinely surprised and i looked back at her . \\n▁ she met my eye and scrunched her brows . \\n▁ ` ` that surprises me . \\n▁ usually when you have a bad session , it takes you a couple days to get … well , to smile again , honestly . '' \\n▁ she shrugged , her concerned look not leaving her . \\n▁ i sighed as i thought back over talking with mrs . ryans yesterday . \\n▁ i 'd messed up . \\n▁ i 'd said way too much and broken a wall i had n't meant to break . \\n▁ i was hastily trying to repair that wall now ; plastering the fragments before it completely fell apart on me . \\n▁ she knew i dreamed of lillian . \\n▁ she knew i considered that a real relationship . \\n▁ she 'd surely assign me medication now … but that did n't mean i had to take it . \\n▁ i did n't have to do anything i did n't want to . \\n▁ well , besides go in the first place . \\n▁ i shrugged and told sawyer the one thing we 'd discussed that i could share . \\n▁ ` ` she surprised me more than anything . \\n▁ she wants me to go to that stupid winter dance . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't been to a dance since … '' i bit my lip and looked back out the window . \\n▁ ` ` it just took me back that she 'd ask me to take you to something like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` she wants you to take me … to a dance ? '' \\n▁ i spun my head back around to her at the incredulity in her voice . \\n▁ she was studying the road . \\n▁ her hair was pulled back into a neat and orderly ponytail , giving me a perfect view of her expression . \\n▁ she was trying to keep her face neutral , but i 'd studied her features long enough to know when she was excited . \\n▁ her eyes flicked along the road , probably not even seeing it and a merry glow seemed to spark in the grayness . \\n▁ the very edges of her lips were curled up in a slight smile and her hands had tightened on the wheel . \\n▁ oh god , she wants to go . \\n▁ i 'd never imagined that possibility . \\n▁ not that i 'd imagined going at all , but still , i 'd pictured sawyer being as resistant to the very idea of it as me . \\n▁ ` ` do you … would you want to go ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , praying she said no … and meant it . \\n▁ she bit her lip , her eyes sparkling even more as she sat up straighter in her seat . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't get … i missed … '' she stumbled around for words before finally shaking her head and sighing . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' ve always … '' she bit her lip again and a light flush ran along her cheeks . \\n▁ she giggled nervously and simply said , ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ she flicked a quick glance at me , noticed the look on my face , that must have been somewhere between humor and horror , and frowned . \\n▁ ` ` but you do n't want to … '' her eyes went back to the main road . \\n▁ ` ` no , of course you do n't want that . \\n▁ that was something you shared with … '' she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` oh , that 's why you were upset … '' i fixed my face and started to say something , but she cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry … of course you do n't want to go . \\n▁ that was stupid of me to think that you might … '' her face flushed deeper and she fixed her eyes straight ahead . \\n▁ my thoughts stuttered and no coherent words came out of me . \\n▁ i shut my mouth and looked out the window as we made the final turn into the school parking lot . \\n▁ i 'd never imagined that conversation playing out this way . \\n▁ i thought i 'd tell her crazy mrs . ryans plans and she 'd laugh it off with me , agreeing that the woman was loony . \\n▁ i 'd never considered that sawyer would actually want to go with me . \\n▁ i watched her worry her lip as she parked the car . \\n▁ of course … she was a girl . \\n▁ as different as she seemed from other girls , as mature and pragmatic as she could seem sometimes , she was still a girl . \\n▁ and i knew from a year of being with lillian , that girls liked dances . \\n▁ they liked getting decked out to the nines in slinky dresses and professionally done up - dos . \\n▁ they liked the loud music and cheesy balloon arches and getting posed photographs taken . \\n▁ they liked seeing their men dress nice and act more gentlemanly than teenage boys generally did , bringing them flowers and taking them out to a nice dinner . \\n▁ they liked standing close and pressing their bodies right up against their men , nearly promising more intimate acts later , if they were taken care of in the right way . \\n▁ i sighed as she shut the car off . \\n▁ if i did this for her , asked her to go , that last part might be a problem . \\n▁ not that i would let anything happen between us … again , but it would violate my new ` ` foot apart '' rule if we slow danced all night . \\n▁ i looked back to her as she started to open her door . \\n▁ i suppose i could put that rule on hold , for one night . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer , '' i said , stopping her from finishing cracking open her escape route . \\n▁ she looked back at me , a faint redness still along her cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` would you like to go to the dance with me ? '' \\n▁ her flush deepened and she let out a nervous laugh . \\n▁ i kept my face steady and even , so she 'd know that i was serious , that i was seriously asking her . \\n▁ her eyebrows rose as she took in my face . \\n▁ ` ` are you being serious ? '' \\n▁ her voice matched her eyes . \\n▁ i nodded and let a smile creep into my lips . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ her eyes narrowed and her brow scrunched together as she twisted in her seat to face me , her escape route momentarily forgotten . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't seem like you wanted to go … why ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` honestly , i do n't . '' \\n▁ her face darkened and i quickly added , ` ` but you do … and after everything … '' my words drifted off as i looked over her softening face . \\n▁ the early light of morning backlit her dark hair and her face glowed at me like an angel . \\n▁ i swallowed as i looked over her features , resisting the urge to cup that porcelain cheek . \\n▁ keeping a distance with her might be harder than i first thought . \\n▁ she tilted her head as she watched whatever emotion was sliding across my features . \\n▁ i swallowed again and looked down , pushing back the odd feeling that had started to build in me . \\n▁ ` ` after everything you ' ve put up with from me , i could at least put up with this … '' i looked up and met her eye again , '' … for you . '' \\n▁ she swallowed as she searched my face . \\n▁ i made myself calmly watch her , unblinking , unworried about the delightful tension building in the car . \\n▁ she locked her gaze to mine , leaning forward slightly . \\n▁ my eyes flicked down to her lips before i caught myself and forcefully looked back up at her eyes . \\n▁ her hand raised and she brushed some hair off my forehead . \\n▁ i wanted to lean into her touch and made myself not react . \\n▁ i also made myself not pull away either . \\n▁ she did n't know about my new rule . \\n▁ she did n't realize she was breaking it . \\n▁ i could n't just initiate something like that without warning her first . \\n▁ when i did n't react or touch her back , she pulled her hand away and set it in her lap . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she said slowly . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd love to go with you . '' \\n▁ she grinned and then turned to open her door . \\n▁ the tension left the car with her and i stayed in my seat a moment , wondering how so much had changed so fast . \\n▁ was n't i dead set against going just yesterday ? \\n▁ she stood outside her car waiting for me , delight clear in her eyes , and shaking my head , i opened my door and joined her . \\n▁ she held her hand out for me and stepped within the one foot radius i 'd mentally set as a ` ` do not enter '' zone . \\n▁ i did n't take her hand and stepped back . \\n▁ she cocked her head at me and i sighed , knowing i 'd have to talk about this with her sooner or later , and sooner was probably a better idea . \\n▁ she started to take a step towards me and i put my hands out to stop her . \\n▁ she shook her head at my gesture , confusion , and maybe a bit of hurt , clear in her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been thinking , '' i started , glancing around to see if any students were this far back in the lot with us . \\n▁ a few were and were watching , but i needed to do this , for her sake . \\n▁ i swallowed and continued , ` ` i. . . \\n▁ do n't want to hurt you any more than i know i have . '' \\n▁ she looked about to argue and i held my hands up higher . \\n▁ ` ` no , i know you think you were as much to blame as me for what happened the other night , but the truth is … '' i paused , wondering what to tell her . \\n▁ i 'd opened this conversation up without thinking about how i could explain keeping her away from me , without hurting her even more . \\n▁ she 'd made every appearance that she liked touching me , liked being close . \\n▁ if i suddenly shoved her back and told her i did n't want her physically near me … well , i could n't see how that would n't hurt her . \\n▁ unless … unless i played the one card every guy my age has . \\n▁ god , i hated to play it . \\n▁ i was n't a neanderthal … i did have control . \\n▁ usually . \\n▁ i half smiled and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just a guy . \\n▁ you 're a really pretty girl and when you 're around me , my body reacts to … '' my cheeks heated , but i made myself say it , ` ` i ' ve never had sex with anyone and i really want to … and when you 're touching me all the time , i forget that we 're only friends and all i can think about is that you have br * * sts and that i 'd like to … '' i swallowed , wanting to crawl back in the car . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i can only control myself so much . \\n▁ i think we should keep some distance between us from now on . '' \\n▁ oh , god . \\n▁ i wanted … to die . \\n▁ her face dropped in shock so many times while i was speaking that it was nearly comical . \\n▁ she sputtered on what to comment on first . \\n▁ ` ` distance ? \\n▁ from me ? \\n▁ you like my … ? \\n▁ you want to … ? \\n▁ wait , you 're a. . . \\n▁ virgin ? '' \\n▁ she shook her head in disbelief as i closed my eyes , wanting to skip forward to the part where this was just a fact between us , and we never talked about it … ever again . \\n▁ ` ` you … you think i ' m pretty ? '' \\n▁ i opened my eyes at that and smiled at the awe on her face as she took that in . \\n▁ only meaning to tell her that of course she was pretty , i found myself whispering , ` ` i think you 're beautiful . '' \\n▁ my voice came out nearly reverent and i mentally slapped myself . \\n▁ god , i might as well shove my tongue down her throat . \\n▁ it would be just as misleading . \\n▁ a warmth settled in me at that thought and i shook my head to break it . \\n▁ her eyes had moistened and her mouth dropped open again . \\n▁ sighing at how my morning was not going as seamlessly as i 'd imagined -lrb- maybe sawyer and i had crossed that line of friendship too many times already … -rrb- , i shoved my hands firmly in my pockets and motioned with my head to the main building . \\n▁ ` ` we 're going to be late , '' i muttered and immediately started walking . \\n▁ she fell into step beside me , and with her gaze never leaving mine for more than a few seconds , we made our way to class . \\n▁ on the way there , i noticed things i had n't seen before - signs for the upcoming winter dance were everywhere . \\n▁ handmade posters were taped up every few feet down the hall , a large banner hung over the window on the staircase and eight by ten notices were plastered on every classroom door , urging students to buy tickets to the last dance of this year . \\n▁ now that i 'd agreed to go , i could n't seem to escape it . \\n▁ interesting how i 'd blocked all this out before . \\n▁ sawyer kept her distance from me but bounded to her seat with a grin on her face . \\n▁ i had no idea what was going on in her head . \\n▁ was it really just about getting dressed up and having fun together , or was she imagining having her arms around my neck all night . \\n▁ i flushed as i thought about how close she 'd be and for how long . \\n▁ i wondered if maybe i should talk to lil , to reassure her that nothing was going to happen . \\n▁ i was just being a good friend and making my counselor happy . \\n▁ but , knowing lillian , she would tearfully smile and tell me that i should let something happen , that i should be with sawyer and not her , or something equally ridiculous . \\n▁ it did n't seem like she was going to break things off with me , but she was sure insistent for me to break things off with her . \\n▁ like i 'd ever do that . \\n▁ i carefully walked past will on the way to my seat . \\n▁ when i looked up at him though , he was busy in a conversation with randy and did n't even notice me . \\n▁ randy glanced up at me and then hurriedly shifted back to his almost intense sounding conversation with will . \\n▁ they seemed to be arguing about the last football game . \\n▁ the season had ended before thanksgiving break and our team … had n't done well . \\n▁ i 'd run into coach in the hallway after the final defeat and he 'd actually scowled at me . \\n▁ like the fact that will tended to drop the ball , and the other team took advantage of that and scored a lot , was somehow my fault . \\n▁ he 'd muttered that i 'd probably let him down for baseball too and then stormed off down the hall . \\n▁ i had n't seen him since , but got the feeling that when spring rolled around , he 'd be all over me to try out . \\n▁ i had no plans to . \\n▁ sawyer had filled me in on bits and pieces of the football games , since she went to most of them . \\n▁ it had surprised me at first when she 'd admitted that she did … i had n't gone to a single one . \\n▁ she 'd said that she went with the safe and sound club , and that a bunch of them from the club went to every game , trying to dissuade the ranks from the debauchery of post - game partying . \\n▁ games were friday nights and before that fateful thanksgiving dinner , we 'd generally parted ways friday afternoon until monday morning . \\n▁ it had never occurred to me that she 'd go to the games without me . \\n▁ she 'd said she would n't if her parents did n't insist on it . \\n▁ apparently they wanted her to reconnect with the community as well . \\n▁ she laughingly had told me about how awful things had gone . \\n▁ i think she 'd been attempting to cheer me up , let me know i was missed . \\n▁ and in a microscopic way , it had . \\n▁ a small part of me enjoyed the fact that my absence was noticed in some small way . \\n▁ at least to coach , if not the rest of the team . \\n▁ for the rest of them … well , i think they 'd rather take the loss than have me play with them . \\n▁ and will had been especially stormy around me when the loss after loss had started being attributed to him . \\n▁ he 'd started acting like my being a better player was a character flaw that needed to be humiliated out of me . \\n▁ as i sat down , i was eternally grateful that he and randy 's conversation had kept him out of my hair , for one morning at least . \\n▁ sawyer had an adorable grin on her throughout the entire class . \\n▁ she seemed to find my multiple mortifying revelations endearing . \\n▁ i still felt flushed with embarrassment . \\n▁ i really had n't wanted to say any of that , especially the being a virgin part , but i could n't tell her the real reason why i needed space and it seemed as good of an excuse as any . \\n▁ maybe if i had n't added that last part about her being beautiful , she would n't look so thrilled . \\n▁ we worked on our reports for the books we were supposed to have finished yesterday and she gave me small , knowing smiles every few minutes . \\n▁ i could n't help but grin back at her , but i did wonder if any of my admissions had been for the best . \\n▁ i walked her to the front doors after class and as we separated she leaned into me , but never actually touched me . \\n▁ with a laugh she jokingly stated that she was headed off to her workout , huffing over to the science building for one class , only to turn back around afterwards and head right back up to the second floor . \\n▁ i laughed with her and wished her luck in her chem . \\n▁ test . \\n▁ when i saw her again she was huffing and getting her breath back , but her face was still excited , darn near elated . \\n▁ i mentally sighed , but returned her beaming smile for her benefit . \\n▁ she 'd been running later than usual and just made it in the door when the bell rang . \\n▁ when i asked her what she 'd been doing , she shyly admitted that she 'd been talking to sally xxunk , the safe and sound club president , about the dance . \\n▁ they 'd been going over hair styles and dress ideas . \\n▁ she was telling me she was concerned about how she 'd afford a nice enough dress when i interrupted her . \\n▁ ` ` you told sally that we 're going together ? '' \\n▁ i had n't meant for my tone to be rough , but in my surprise it kind of came out that way . \\n▁ i rarely talked to anyone besides sawyer , so it always kind of threw me for a loop that she kept up conversations with other people besides me . \\n▁ again , i can be a little self absorbed . \\n▁ her happy face fell as she looked over mine . \\n▁ i instantly felt bad for bursting her excited bubble and tried to apologize when mr . varner slammed his hand down on my desk . \\n▁ i jumped about a foot and turned to stare up at him with wide eyes . \\n▁ ` ` mr . west , miss smith … do i need to separate you two lovebirds ? '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed as he flicked his gaze between the both of us . \\n▁ he ran a hand through his hair and among the giggles running through the classroom , i heard someone dreamily sigh . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i muttered , slinking back in my chair . \\n▁ he crossed his arms over his chest , and even though i wished this were a dream and i could whisk him away , he remained standing xxunk in front of my desk . \\n▁ ` ` what were you talking about anyway ? '' \\n▁ his eyes flicked around to the students listening intently and my face heated . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve always wondered what 's so vital that students choose to tune me out . '' \\n▁ his hands made a go ahead gesture and he sat on the edge of the desk in front of mine , the girl there nearly swooning out of her seat . \\n▁ ` ` so , go ahead … we 're all ears . '' \\n▁ sawyer flushed bright red and bit her lip , while i shook my head . \\n▁ no way was i xxunk up to him , i 'd rather have detention . \\n▁ unfortunately , the girl with mr . varner 's rump on her desk decided to be teacher 's pet . \\n▁ i could only imagine what favors she thought she was winning . \\n▁ ` ` they were talking about going to the dance together , mr . varner , '' she said brightly . \\n▁ he smiled at her and then looked back to us with a tilted head . \\n▁ ` ` a dance … how touching . '' \\n▁ he stood from her desk , making her sigh , and stepped up to mine , leaning over the edge . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be going to that little dance as well , mr . west . '' \\n▁ his eyes flicked down me a little contemptuously . \\n▁ ` ` and if you so much as whiff of alcohol … you 're gone . '' \\n▁ my eyes narrowed and i felt myself starting to stand . \\n▁ i wanted to smack that smug look off his face , and with the surge of embarrassment and anger running through me , i thought i could do it . \\n▁ when i was in a half crouch , i felt a hand on my arm and looked over at sawyer , who was shaking her head at me emphatically . \\n▁ mr . varner smirked and stood up straight . \\n▁ he raised two fingers at me . \\n▁ ` ` two strikes , lucas . '' \\n▁ i clenched my hands into fists and made myself stay seated and quiet while he sauntered back to the front of the room . \\n▁ the students around me started giggling and whispering , and i knew the rumor mill had just ground out a new story . \\n▁ maybe in this one i 'd actually slug the bastard . \\n▁ i was still steaming about the incident with mr . varner when sawyer and i were huddled around her locker later . \\n▁ i kept my back to the lockers and did n't look at them . \\n▁ this morning had started out so well , but it was steadily spiraling downward . \\n▁ i tried to let the heat slide off of me as i rested my head back on the cool metal . \\n▁ i looked over when sawyer slammed her locker shut . \\n▁ ` ` he 's such an ass ! \\n▁ i do n't get what girls see in him . '' \\n▁ she looked at me pointedly . \\n▁ ` ` does a chiseled face really make up for poor social skills now ? '' \\n▁ i grinned at her xxunk , feeling my own die down . \\n▁ ` ` chiseled ? '' \\n▁ i teased . \\n▁ she returned my grin and then frowned a little . \\n▁ ` ` are you mad that i told sally ? '' \\n▁ she bit her lip and leaned against her locker . \\n▁ i watched her shoulder compress against the locker that should have been my girlfriend 's and sighed . \\n▁ i wished lil was here . \\n▁ i wished i was asleep and could see her . \\n▁ i startled out of my odd desire and shifted my focus back to sawyer . \\n▁ i shook my head at her . \\n▁ ` ` no , it just surprised me , that 's all . '' \\n▁ she tilted her head and i sighed again and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` sometimes i forget that you have a life without me . '' \\n▁ she smiled and started to reach out for me , but then stopped herself . \\n▁ i was glad she had , but found myself with an actual ache at the loss . \\n▁ this was going to be a lot harder than i thought . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't have much of a life , if it makes you feel better . '' \\n▁ with a grin she started walking down the hall towards math and i fell into step with her . \\n▁ she looked over at me with a seriousness on her face that i knew pretty well . \\n▁ she was about to say something beyond her years . \\n▁ ` ` you could have it too , you know . '' \\n▁ i scrunched my brow , confused . \\n▁ ` ` huh ? '' \\n▁ she lightly shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` have a life . \\n▁ have other friends . '' \\n▁ ice flashed through me , but i threw on a smile . \\n▁ ` ` why would i want other friends , when i ' m perfectly content with you ? '' \\n▁ i shifted my grin to a crooked one and bit back what i was really feeling . \\n▁ no one in this school wanted a friendship with me . \\n▁ no one but sawyer . \\n▁ she was all i had here . \\n▁ really , she was all i had awake . \\n▁ sawyer seemed to hear my silent words as we walked among the crowds that i felt watching and whispering about us . \\n▁ my upcoming appearance at a school function would be well known by the end of the day . \\n▁ ` ` i know i ' ve mentioned this before , luc , but not everyone here is against you . '' \\n▁ i scoffed at that , not meaning to sound angry and bitter , but clearly hearing it in my own voice anyway . \\n▁ ` ` right , nothing but warm fuzzies here . '' \\n▁ i looked around the groups as we walked by . \\n▁ at the people i 'd known since practically kindergarten . \\n▁ i do n't know what sawyer saw , but all i saw were heads bent together in gossip , and i was tired of being gossiped about . \\n▁ sawyer sighed . \\n▁ ` ` well , there 's randy , and that 's just one instance . '' \\n▁ i stopped in the hallway as her casual remark settled in my system . \\n▁ was she joking ? \\n▁ she looked around when she felt that i was n't beside her anymore and then looked back at me , her eyebrows raised . \\n▁ i stood a couple paces behind her , my mouth dropped open in what could only resemble a mentally impaired person . \\n▁ ` ` randy ? '' \\n▁ i said , incredulously while i heard the kids lining the hall quiet . \\n▁ ` ` are you serious ? \\n▁ you know what josh had him do to me . \\n▁ you think he wants to be pals ? '' \\n▁ my tone was getting louder and louder as i spoke and sawyer glanced around the hallway before stepping close to me , well within my one foot zone . \\n▁ i was so irritated that i did n't care though . \\n▁ quietly , she whispered , ` ` yes , lucas , randy . \\n▁ if you 'd pay a little closer attention , you 'd see that he feels really bad about drugging you . '' \\n▁ i started to pull away , but she grabbed my arm , dragging me closer . \\n▁ ` ` josh tricked him into doing it . \\n▁ randy told me that josh told him it was a liquid xxunk . \\n▁ randy did n't know what would happen . \\n▁ he just wanted you to suffer a little bit . \\n▁ he did n't know you 'd get suspended . '' \\n▁ i jerked away from her arm , pulling apart . \\n▁ i was sure it looked like we were having a lover 's spat , but regardless of my actions , sawyer was n't the one i was angry with . \\n▁ no , i was mad at everyone else - all of them , all of my xxunk , all of the whisperers and all of the xxunk - xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` when did you … '' i shook my head , not really caring when she 'd had this heart - to - heart with one of my tormentors . \\n▁ ` ` well , that 's so much better . \\n▁ i ' m glad he only wanted to send me to the john for a few hours . '' \\n▁ i threw my hands up as my voice got loud again . \\n▁ ` ` god , what a relief , sawyer ! '' \\n▁ her face flushed and with an irritated shake of her head , she stormed off down the hall . \\n▁ closing my eyes and cursing my dramatics , i hurried after her . \\n▁ everyone watched us leave . \\n▁ i grabbed her elbow right as she slipped into the door . \\n▁ she looked down at where we were touching and then up to my face . \\n▁ red blotches were still along her cheeks and i sighed , hating that i 'd hurt her . \\n▁ ignoring every person in the classroom , ignoring the teacher writing on the white board , ignoring my own desire to keep a distance between us - ignoring it all , i pulled her into a tight hug . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ i ' m an ass , i ' m sorry , '' i whispered into her hair . \\n▁ she nodded against my chest and returned my tight embrace . \\n▁ i sighed as i kept my eyes closed . \\n▁ here i was , just a few hours after telling her that i needed physical space , holding her tight , like i was afraid she 'd vanish if i did n't , while every eye around us watched . \\n▁ i was trying to avoid misleading her and i was trying to avoid more gossip about us … and i was failing miserably . \\n▁ a giggling titter filled the room and i finally broke apart from her , feeling my cheeks heat . \\n▁ her face was flushed as well as she looked around the semi - filled room and awkwardly adjusted her bag on her shoulder . \\n▁ i motioned to our seats and we gratefully sat down . \\n▁ a few eyes followed us back there before turning into each other , the whispering starting again . \\n▁ i got out my book and flipped through the pages , not seeing any of them . \\n▁ i heard sawyer beside me do the same and snuck a glance at her . \\n▁ she was staring at her desk , but met my gaze when she felt my eyes . \\n▁ ` i ' m sorry , ' i mouthed again and she nodded . \\n▁ the bell rang , the teacher turned from where she 'd been writing equations on the board and everything fell back into normalcy . \\n▁ well , as normal as things ever got for me . \\n▁ i thought about sawyer 's comments during class . \\n▁ i ignored my over - reaction to them and really focused on what she 'd been saying . \\n▁ i could n't believe it . \\n▁ i did n't see how anyone in this school would want anything to do with me . \\n▁ it was n't like anyone ever approached me , other than to ask me questions i 'd answered so many times , i was sick of it . \\n▁ i 'd stopped even answering them awhile ago . \\n▁ and randy … that one was definitely off . \\n▁ no way was he looking to be my friend . \\n▁ no frickin ' way . \\n▁ things got back to normal between us during lunch in her car . \\n▁ we lay back in her seats and ate our sandwiches and she commented that her dad had finally gotten a job with the logging company , so things were looking up for her family . \\n▁ she happily bit into her very own xxunk when she said that . \\n▁ i blinked at her in surprise when she did . \\n▁ i had n't realized her dad was out of work . \\n▁ i knew things were tough for them , but never really knew why , and had never asked . \\n▁ ` ` that 's great , sawyer . \\n▁ i did n't realize he was looking . '' \\n▁ i grabbed a corner off my own ham and cheese sandwich and curled it into a ball before eating it . \\n▁ she watched my habit before responding . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ he and mom both quit their jobs when we moved out here . \\n▁ they ' ve both been looking , but times are tough … '' she shrugged and looked really guilty . \\n▁ i wondered why , until i remembered that her parents had dropped everything and moved out to the middle of nowhere -lrb- from portland she 'd told me once -rrb- because of her . \\n▁ ` ` do you want to talk about what happened , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ i said quietly while she spaced out , gazing over my shoulder . \\n▁ she brought her eyes back to me and shook her head a little , snapping out of her mini - trance . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she smiled and her face got animated again . \\n▁ ` ` i want to talk about the dance . '' \\n▁ she was grinning ear to ear and i could n't help but grin with her . \\n▁ she was so excited about this stupid dance . \\n▁ i rolled my eyes , but then laughed and we started going over the details . \\n▁ the dance was the last friday night before the school broke for the holidays . \\n▁ it was a winter wonderland theme , of course , and both guys and girls were expected to wear nice dress clothes . \\n▁ sawyer was a little anxious about that , not being able to afford anything even remotely nice yet , even though her dad was now employed . \\n▁ i told her my mom had a couple of nice party dresses that would probably fit her if she wanted to wear one . \\n▁ she looked at me oddly and said she 'd have to look at them first . \\n▁ then she smiled brightly and started going on about xxunk . \\n▁ we were talking about having dinner at my place to save on cash -lrb- she made me promise that we would n't be having my hot pocket standard -rrb- , as we walked to our next classes . \\n▁ i shook my head at her as we parted ways . \\n▁ for someone who seemed almost anti - social at times , she sure was digging this . \\n▁ as i walked to science , i was surprisingly grateful to mrs . ryans for even bringing up the idea . \\n▁ maybe it would be good to get out in the real world . \\n▁ as i opened the door to astronomy , i reconsidered . \\n▁ josh was glaring at me and i quickly ducked my head and broke eye contact . \\n▁ we had n't had any confrontations in awhile and i was trying to keep it that way . \\n▁ i heard his laughter and resisted the urge to look as i sat down . \\n▁ keeping my eyes straight ahead , i started daydreaming about lillian to distract myself ; i could n't wait to see her tonight . \\n▁ i was in the middle of xxunk slow dancing with her in my dream , my fingers low on her waist , hers running through the back of my hair , when a wadded up piece of paper smacked me in the side of the head . \\n▁ irritated , i looked over before i could stop myself . \\n▁ josh was laughing , sneering cruelly while randy held down his arm , stopping him from chucking another piece . \\n▁ brushing it off , i exhaled slowly and stared straight ahead , again . \\n▁ ` ` hey , luc , '' i heard josh say from the other side of the room . \\n▁ ` ` heard your date to the dance went off on you . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes and focused on my breath , focused on not reacting . \\n▁ it had n't taken very long for that tiny spat to twist into high school dramatics . \\n▁ josh , apparently enjoying my attempt at non - reaction , continued , ` ` hear she only agreed to go in the first place to be your designated driver . \\n▁ at least one of you is smart , '' he added . \\n▁ my head twisted around as i visually drove nails into his body . \\n▁ that ? \\n▁ that was the way he was going to spin our fight in the hall ? \\n▁ i gripped the edge of my desk , my fingers digging into the hard , wooden top , urging the flare of anger he sparked in me to die down . \\n▁ he started rocking with laughter at my reaction and i started shaking from the restraint . \\n▁ biting my lip to not tell him to go to hell , i made myself face front again . \\n▁ the laughter from his side of the room grew even louder . \\n▁ fortunately the bell rang and the teacher started class . \\n▁ i knew it was too late though . \\n▁ i knew the student body would take that pathetic gossip and run with it . \\n▁ by the end of the day , the very idea of me going to the dance with sawyer would be akin to me going with a breathalyzer attached to my arm ; someone to keep me in check , since i obviously could n't do it on my own . \\n▁ i sighed as i listened to what had once been my favorite subject . \\n▁ what else could i have expected from these people ? \\n▁ definitely not friendship . \\n▁ sawyer was so wrong about that . \\n▁ as soon as i could , i darted out of that class . \\n▁ even though i 'd sat in the back , i got out into the fresh , chilly air before everyone else , having gotten up from my seat a second before the bell had even rung . \\n▁ i heard josh snigger as i left the room , and practically speed - walking to my next class , i pictured an irate darren beside me . \\n▁ i imagined restraining him from turning around and beating the shit out of josh . \\n▁ much like the time i 'd had to restrain him from wanting to go after some senior last year who had said sammy had a fat ass . \\n▁ personally , i think the guy was just upset that sammy had turned him down , but darren had taken it as a personal attack on his girlfriend . \\n▁ he 'd been determined to give the guy a broken nose … in the middle of american history . \\n▁ i 'd dragged him out of the room with both arms locked under his elbows as he 'd yelled threats at the imbecile . \\n▁ picturing restraining hot - headed darren from fighting helped calm the inner beast within me , and i felt more relaxed with each step away from josh . \\n▁ for as much as i understood his anger , as much as i tried to ignore the hurts and insults , a part of me just wanted to kick his f * * king ass ! \\n▁ much like darren had done when he 'd finally run into that guy at a party a few weeks later . \\n▁ using darren 's remembered temper to moderate mine , by the time i stepped through the doors into art class , i was calm again . \\n▁ josh was behind me for the day and i could let him go . \\n▁ i was easing a smile onto my face and working on my latest project , when i felt mrs . xxunk come up beside me . \\n▁ she praised me for my work and then chirpily said , ` ` i hear you 're going to the dance , tom . \\n▁ that 's great ! '' \\n▁ she walked away before i could respond to that and i shook my head as i watched her , her loose pants and flowing tunic a myriad of contrasting colors that was almost dizzying to look at . \\n▁ how had my spacey art teacher heard that already ? \\n▁ news traveled so fast around here . \\n▁ i waited outside of art for sawyer to get out of choir . \\n▁ i 'd tried to go to one of their concerts once , but she 'd told me she 'd rather not have me there , so i had n't ever heard her sing . \\n▁ she 'd explained it away as her having a solo that she 'd never be able to get through , if she knew i was listening . \\n▁ i was dying to hear her sing , especially if she was good enough for the teacher to have her sing by herself , but i 'd respected her wished and stayed away . \\n▁ looking back on that , i wondered if it was more keeping me away from her parents , than her nerves . \\n▁ or maybe it had been a combination of the two . \\n▁ i waited for awhile and frowned . \\n▁ she was taking a long time to get out of there . \\n▁ remembering the flood of gossip that had started this day , i started to worry about her . \\n▁ brittany hopped on anything she could to tease her , and i 'd handed her a nice little bouquet to choose from . \\n▁ i started walking over to the room just as her black hair came out the door . \\n▁ she immediately looked over to me and started walking my way . \\n▁ she walked tall and straight and did n't look behind her . \\n▁ i did . \\n▁ brittany , and the group that usually flocked around their queen , was just exiting the building as well . \\n▁ they were looking over at her and laughing . \\n▁ brittany looked past sawyer 's back , to me , scowling at her . \\n▁ the smile fell from her lips and she glared at me . \\n▁ then her lips twisted into a look that clearly said ` come get me ' . \\n▁ i was not about to . \\n▁ ignoring her , i focused back to sawyer as she walked up and adjusted the bag on her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` everything … okay ? \\n▁ ` ` i asked , glancing at brittany 's retreating form , her h * ps swaying in a much too exaggerated way to be a natural walk . \\n▁ she confirmed that by looking over her shoulder at me . \\n▁ she muttered something to the girl beside her , which made her laugh and look at me too . \\n▁ when their joint laughter died down , her friend faced front while brittany lifted a lip derisively and ran a hand down her ass seductively . \\n▁ i shook my head at her odd , mixed attitude towards me and turned back to sawyer , who was watching her as well . \\n▁ i was about to ask her what brittany had done , when she interrupted me . \\n▁ ` ` i can never tell if she wants to screw you … or kill you . '' \\n▁ she turned back to me with furrowed brows . \\n▁ i shook my head and sighed . \\n▁ ` ` i know … i ca n't either . \\n▁ what did she say to you ? '' \\n▁ she shook her hair out , her face relaxing as she did . \\n▁ ` ` does n't matter . \\n▁ i do n't know what her problem is with me , and i ca n't control what she does or says … '' she exhaled and let a warm smile touch her lips . \\n▁ ` ` but it 's still up to me how i react to it , right ? '' \\n▁ i smiled and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` you sound like my counselor now . '' \\n▁ she laughed and motioned with her head to the main building . \\n▁ ` ` well , maybe i ' ve discovered my calling in life . '' \\n▁ i laughed . \\n▁ ` ` being my counselor ? \\n▁ do you think that would be a lifelong job ? '' \\n▁ she giggled beside me , staring at me with adoration clear on her face . \\n▁ ` ` i hope so . '' \\n▁ i swallowed at the look in her eye and then nervously chuckled . \\n▁ ` ` well , do n't expect it to pay much . '' \\n▁ she laughed and shoved her hands in her pockets . \\n▁ for a second , i missed that i could n't hold her hand , but it was for the best . \\n▁ i should n't be so friendly with her , if it was n't going to go anywhere other than , well , friendship . \\n▁ i shoved my hands in my pockets as well , and we made our way to our next activities in a comfortable silence . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i looked away and muttered , ` ` ready , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ i heard her stand and cheerily say goodbye to sally . \\n▁ she was still buzzing about the dance and they 'd apparently been talking about it . \\n▁ as she hopped off the bleachers , i glanced back at sally . \\n▁ she nodded politely at me , but had on odd look on her face - almost compassionate and disapproving . \\n▁ like she understood how hard things were for me , but still did n't like me or what i 'd done . \\n▁ i could understand that . \\n▁ as sawyer and i walked away , i shook my head and sighed . \\n▁ she asked if i was alright and instead of my usual answer of fine , i told her that sally did n't like me . \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` no , she does . '' \\n▁ i gave her a blank look . \\n▁ ` ` she said that . '' \\n▁ she frowned and her eyes shifted to the corners as she ran through past conversations in her head . \\n▁ ` ` well , no , not outright . '' \\n▁ she looked back to me . \\n▁ ` ` she 's never said anything bad about you though . '' \\n▁ i smirked that in her logic , not saying anything mean was akin to being liked . \\n▁ ` ` that 's because she likes you , sawyer . '' \\n▁ pointedly i said , ` ` believe me , she does n't trust me and she does n't like me . \\n▁ if you told her you were going with someone else to the dance , you 'd see it . \\n▁ she 'd probably do cartwheels . '' \\n▁ she sighed as she opened the gym door . \\n▁ ` ` not everyone 's against you , luc . '' \\n▁ i sighed as i followed her out . \\n▁ ` ` so you keep telling me … '' i was anxious to go to bed after sawyer left for the night . \\n▁ i desperately wanted to see lil . \\n▁ wishing for bedtime made the evening go by exceedingly slow . \\n▁ especially since mom was working and i had no one to help me pass the time . \\n▁ i ended up crawling into bed at six and staring at my ceiling , willing sleep to claim me . \\n▁ when it did n't , i considered popping an xxunk … but , remembering my promise to sawyer and her face when we 'd talked about it , i did n't . \\n▁ eventually my body did succumb to slumber and i drifted away to unconsciousness . \\n▁ i floated in a hazy realm , not really knowing where i was or when i was or even what i was . \\n▁ then my world seemed to solidify and i had the distinct feeling of cool air brushing across my cheek , followed by the sound of gravel crunching under my shoes . \\n▁ i smelled crisp , clean air and heard a train rumbling in the distance . \\n▁ i smiled as i realized where i was . \\n▁ i turned and behind me was a rundown looking split - level home with a large rectangular paved driveway , a basketball hoop prominently hanging over the garage . \\n▁ the house had seen better days , but busy parents with two rambunctious boys had made home repairs fall by the wayside . \\n▁ two rambunctious boys … and me , i suppose , since i was as much a part of this household as the actual sons , darren and josh . \\n▁ i looked over the house , reminiscing . \\n▁ i had n't been to the home in real life since the accident . \\n▁ darren 's family still lived there , i just was n't welcome anymore . \\n▁ looking at the picture perfect memory i 'd created , i smiled as i took in the second story window with a shutter missing . \\n▁ josh had tried sneaking out one night and stumbling , pulled off the decorative wood as they both tumbled to the ground . \\n▁ they 'd never repaired the window , using the money to repair josh 's arm instead . \\n▁ i moved my eyes over to the gutter , half pulled away from the home by darren . \\n▁ he 'd been convinced he was spiderman when he was eight , and had tried climbing up the house to prove it to me , since i 'd said he was full of crap . \\n▁ he 'd realized he was n't , the minute the gutter gave way under his weight and he 'd fallen heavily to the ground , twisting his ankle . \\n▁ i took in the other features i knew so well , as well as my own home . \\n▁ the worn spot on the first floor roof that we 'd created from years of us jumping from that point into their collapsible pool . \\n▁ the dent in the garage door where darren had accidently backed his geo into it . \\n▁ the long scratch along the side of the house that darren and josh had made when they 'd tried to haul a full size ping - pong table down the narrow rosebush - lined path that led to the front door . \\n▁ the only thing they 'd successfully done that day was scratch the home and trample some of their mom 's beloved flowers . \\n▁ no one in the house had been happy that night . \\n▁ still , i ' m sure darren 's mom would take a thousand of those nights over the one night i had given her months ago . \\n▁ a long sigh came out of me as i thought about the last time i saw her . \\n▁ it was at darren 's funeral . \\n▁ she would n't even look at me . \\n▁ i could n't bring myself to talk to her , her or darren 's dad . \\n▁ i 'd watched them from the back of the ceremony , wondering how much they hated me . \\n▁ i did n't see how they could feel anything less than loathing for me . \\n▁ it had certainly been that way for lil and sammy 's parents . \\n▁ sammy 's mom had slapped me at her funeral . \\n▁ my mom had nearly slapped the woman back , but she 'd broken down into sobs and had to be carted off by sammy 's older brothers . \\n▁ the entire family had left town not long after . \\n▁ lil 's parents had also moved , gone back to where they had originally moved out here from . \\n▁ her parents had been more reserved around me , not seeming to hold any anger , just regret . \\n▁ they 'd regretted bringing her out here in the first place . \\n▁ they 'd regretted fostering our relationship . \\n▁ and they 'd regretted trusting me . \\n▁ the last thing her father had said to me was , ` ` how could you not be more careful . '' \\n▁ since i asked myself that same thing every day , i could only hang my head at him and say , ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ her parents had left with her baby sister not long after . \\n▁ the only ones left were josh and his mom and dad . \\n▁ i did n't see the latter two people ; we all avoided anything that might bring us into contact with each other . \\n▁ as for josh … well , him i could n't avoid until i graduated . \\n▁ a voice in front of me snapped me out of my melancholy . \\n▁ ` ` catch . '' \\n▁ instinctively i looked up , right as a basketball headed for my chest . \\n▁ i caught it , my head snapping to darren in front of me , laughing . \\n▁ i laughed as well and bounced the ball a couple times . \\n▁ he squatted to defend the basket behind him and i crouched down as well , moving the ball from one side of me to the other . \\n▁ ` ` hey , darren , good to see you . '' \\n▁ he shifted from one foot to the other , watching my movements . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , well , i get bored just hanging out with two girls all the time … thought i 'd surprise you . '' \\n▁ i chuckled at the thought of him , sammy and lillian all hanging around some ethereal place , waiting for a doorway to my dreams to open . \\n▁ a part of me knew that was n't how it worked , that they were n't real people , waiting around for me , but it eased my heart to think of them that way , to think of them with full and complete lives , even when i was n't around . \\n▁ much like sawyer , as i 'd fully realized today . \\n▁ he grinned and i suddenly moved with the ball , twirling around him when he got close to me . \\n▁ coach was right though , darren had good hands . \\n▁ he snaked out and tore the ball away from me , twisting and shooting before i had barely even registered that the ball was gone . \\n▁ it swished through the hoop and he pumped a fist in the air . \\n▁ he pointed over to me as he went to grab the ball that was starting to bounce over into the grass . \\n▁ ` ` you still suck , lucas . '' \\n▁ he laughed as he reached down to pick the ball up . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd think you 'd make yourself better in your dreams . '' \\n▁ i exhaled slowly as i took his place , crouching in front of the basket . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m all about realism , '' i muttered sullenly . \\n▁ he dribbled the ball and cocked his head at me . \\n▁ ` ` is that why you and lil still have n't done it ? '' \\n▁ i straightened at his comment and he darted past me , scoring another basket . \\n▁ he laughed as he scooped up the ball and tossed it to my still standing in the same spot body . \\n▁ i caught it and gave him a glare . \\n▁ ` ` we 're going to , darren … soon . '' \\n▁ i dribbled the ball and changed places with him . \\n▁ he crouched down , ready for me and i immediately tried to fake him out and get around him . \\n▁ did n't work . \\n▁ he anticipated the move and ducked under my hand to catch the dribble before i could . \\n▁ deftly he twisted and backhanded the ball into the basket . \\n▁ show off . \\n▁ i scooped it up as he laughed at me again . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll never score , luc . '' \\n▁ knowing he meant that in more ways than one , i forcefully chucked the ball at him . \\n▁ he grunted when he caught it . \\n▁ ` ` hey , '' he muttered . \\n▁ i stood under the basket with my arms out . \\n▁ ` ` what 's really on your mind , darren ? '' \\n▁ he idly bounced the ball as he stared at me . \\n▁ finally , he sighed and shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` i just think it 's stupid , luc . '' \\n▁ i crossed my arms over my chest and leaned back , waiting for him to explain that . \\n▁ he sighed again and held the ball under his arm . \\n▁ ` ` you held off hav * * g s * x with lil in real life , but you 're trying to get her to go all the way with you in your dreams ? \\n▁ you 're demented man . '' \\n▁ i glowered at him as irritation sparked in me . \\n▁ why did he always have to go there ? \\n▁ ` ` thanks . '' \\n▁ my tone was flat , not amused in the slightest . \\n▁ sniffing , i raised my chin and added , ` ` why should n't we ? \\n▁ as you always say - it 's just sex . \\n▁ why make such a big deal out of it ? '' \\n▁ he looked at me incredulously , like i 'd just asked him the most outrageous thing he 'd ever heard . \\n▁ ` ` uh , because she 's dead . \\n▁ because we 're not talking about you guys holding off at junior prom because she thought it was too cliche . \\n▁ she 's a corpse , dude . '' \\n▁ i blanched at his harsh choice of words . \\n▁ ` ` so are you . '' \\n▁ one edge of his lip twisted into a wry grin as he brought a hand to his chest . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , but we 're only talking . \\n▁ we 're not screwing . '' \\n▁ i looked away from him , wishing he would drop this and just hang out with me , just be the best friend i needed him to be . \\n▁ my real life was hard enough . \\n▁ i did n't need that filtering into my dreams too . \\n▁ ` ` i want to , darren . '' \\n▁ quieter i added , ` ` i always wanted to . '' \\n▁ i felt him come up to me and put a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ reluctantly , i looked back at him . \\n▁ his face was firm , but deeply sympathetic . \\n▁ ` ` but you did n't , luc . \\n▁ you guys decided to wait … and you ran out of time . '' \\n▁ he shook his head , a sad smile playing on his lips . \\n▁ ` ` you have to let that go . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , my brows furrowing . \\n▁ ` ` no , i ca n't … i do n't … '' i shut my mouth and paused , collecting myself . \\n▁ ` ` this way i can be with her . \\n▁ we can pick up right where we left off . \\n▁ it will be like nothing bad ever happened . '' \\n▁ i knew my eyes and voice were pleading with him , and i was n't sure why i needed his support on this so badly . \\n▁ maybe i was just tired of being chastised by people on the subject . \\n▁ he sighed and dropped the ball on the ground . \\n▁ it bounced just once and then ominously stuck to the ground with a dull thud . \\n▁ darren ran his hands through his hair and grunted irritably . \\n▁ he flung his hands out to his sides as he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` bad things did happen , lucas . \\n▁ and you ca n't just wish them away . '' \\n▁ he waved his arms around him , indicating his house and the driveway . \\n▁ ` ` dude , all of this is just in your head . \\n▁ if you have sex with her , it will just be in your head ! '' \\n▁ he gave me a pointed look and poked a finger in my chest . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll just wake up all alone in your bed , with wet sheets , wishing you had something more . '' \\n▁ i stepped back and lightly pushed his shoulders away from me . \\n▁ i felt my jaw tighten as i answered him . \\n▁ he was hitting too close to home , and fear started to mix with my irritation . \\n▁ ` ` so … it will feel real during . '' \\n▁ his face remained sympathetic , but his tone betrayed his own rising temper . \\n▁ ` ` but , luc … it 's not . \\n▁ she 's dead , man … let her go , let us all go . '' \\n▁ he stepped forward and put his hands on my shoulders , shaking me lightly , like he wanted to shake some sense into me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're going to die a virgin because you ca n't let her go . \\n▁ wet dreams will be the extent of your relationships , and that 's not fair to the real people who love you . \\n▁ and she does , you know . \\n▁ and you do too . '' \\n▁ i smacked his arms away and raised mine up in the air . \\n▁ ` ` what the hell are you talking about ? '' \\n▁ he ran a hand through his hair . \\n▁ ` ` god , i never realized what a f * * king moron you are . '' \\n▁ he shoved my shoulder again . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer , idiot . \\n▁ you want to be with sawyer . \\n▁ you know that … right ? '' \\n▁ i bristled , suddenly furious that everyone was trying to tell me how i felt . \\n▁ that everyone was after me for wanting to be with my girlfriend . \\n▁ what was so wrong about wanting to be loyal to my girlfriend ? \\n▁ could n't people just leave me to my fantasy life ? \\n▁ could n't my fantasy life leave me to my fantasy life ? \\n▁ i stepped back and made to move around him . \\n▁ ` ` why ca n't we just get together and hang out like we used to , darren ? \\n▁ why do you always have to get after me ? '' \\n▁ his hands reached out to stop me and i turned to face him . \\n▁ i thought his eyes were misted over , but i could n't really tell through my own angry fog . \\n▁ ` ` because i ' m your best friend . \\n▁ and sometimes that means i have to tell you things you do n't want to hear . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , my anger fading as sadness filled me . \\n▁ ` ` your brother , your whole family , the school , god , the whole town … nothing there is easy for me . \\n▁ i just need you to accept that this is how i want things … and be my friend . \\n▁ i need this , darren . \\n▁ i need you guys . '' \\n▁ his eyes definitely misted . \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc . \\n▁ and if i thought it would help you , i would n't say anything . \\n▁ but , you 're scaring me . \\n▁ you 're scaring all of us . \\n▁ you lived , luc … '' he clutched my shoulders , a tear dropping to his cheek , '' … so live . '' \\n▁ the icy fear i 'd felt before returned , and i suddenly did n't want to be there anymore . \\n▁ i backed away from him , feeling more like i was at a counseling session , backing away from mrs . ryans , than backing away from my best friend . \\n▁ as much as i tried to recreate my old life , i suddenly felt like i had n't recreated it at all . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve got ta wake up now , darren . \\n▁ i 'll see you around . '' \\n▁ his face pleaded at me as another tear dropped to his cheek . \\n▁ ` ` wait … luc … '' my eyes opened and i stared at my ceiling , still seeing darren 's stricken face . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and felt the tears well , but i forced them back and made myself get up . \\n▁ it was still late at night , not as much time had gone by as it had seemed . \\n▁ i stood and ran a hand down my face , wanting that dream to fade out of my memory . \\n▁ i 'd gotten too used to retaining them though . \\n▁ it was such a habit in me , pulling in every moment of the dreams so that i would n't forget them , that i could n't stop myself from doing it now . \\n▁ the conversation was embedded in me , like it or not . \\n▁ i stood and made my way to my door , wanting some water . \\n▁ i stopped when my eye caught the picture i always had tucked in my mirror . \\n▁ i stared at darren 's face in it and wondered if my dream version of him was as close to the real darren as i thought it was . \\n▁ unfortunately , i had nothing to compare it to . \\n▁ darren and i had never had a conversation about sleeping with a dead girl in real life . \\n▁ in fact , the only conversations we 'd had about sex , were him usually teasing me for my lack of it . \\n▁ he 'd never understood why we 'd let opportunity after opportunity pass us by , time and time again . \\n▁ sometimes i did n't either , but we 'd thought we 'd had more time . \\n▁ we 'd thought we 'd had all the time in the world . \\n▁ we were so wrong . \\n▁ i tore my eyes away from the picture and made my way out to the hallway , needing that water now . \\n▁ i stopped just outside my door and paused , every fiber of me shooting with anticipatory energy . \\n▁ i heard a voice coming from the kitchen . \\n▁ immediately , i looked back at my mom 's door . \\n▁ it was late , or early depending on your definition , and mom should be home from the diner . \\n▁ her door was closed and her light was off . \\n▁ i could n't tell if she was in there or not . \\n▁ i turned back to the hallway and listened harder as i lightly crept along the wall . \\n▁ i did n't know who was in our house , or whether or not they meant us any harm , all i knew for sure , was the voice was deep - a man 's voice , and oddly … familiar . \\n▁ i paused in the living room where i could hear better , my entire body tense . \\n▁ a softer voice answered the man 's and i recognized it as my mother 's . \\n▁ i relaxed as i realized she was talking to someone she knew . \\n▁ that probably meant the person was n't going to attack us . \\n▁ curiosity propelled me forward though . \\n▁ who was she talking to at this hour ? \\n▁ the voices were too low to make out the words , but the tone was a soft and relaxed one and occasionally a soft , feminine laugh echoed back to me . \\n▁ the overall vibe i sensed was that she was having a friendly conversation . \\n▁ i inched even closer , hating that i was kind of spying on her , but not able to stand not knowing . \\n▁ i had a sudden respect for cats and their dreaded sense of curiosity . \\n▁ just when i thought i heard the man say something with my name in it , followed by a long sigh and an , ` ` i do n't know '' from my mom , i clumsily bumped against the end table next to the couch , knocking over a picture frame on top of it . \\n▁ i immediately righted it , but by the silence in the kitchen , i knew they 'd heard that . \\n▁ feeling guilty and stupid , i darted back to my room . \\n▁ leaning against my door , i heard the front door open and close . \\n▁ i exhaled softly and leaned my head back against the wood , wondering what that had been about . \\n▁ i could hear my mom coming up the hall and i froze , careful to not make a sound , so she 'd think i was still sleeping . \\n▁ her shuffling feet paused at my door and i felt her lean close to it . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? \\n▁ are you awake ? '' \\n▁ she asked softly . \\n▁ i stifled a sigh , torn by wanting to lie with silence , and wanting to be honest and confess . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ she said again . \\n▁ i did let out a sigh this time and turning , opened the door . \\n▁ i kept enough from my mom already ; i really could n't handle keeping anymore . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m awake , '' i muttered , as i guiltily looked down at my feet . \\n▁ ` ` is everything okay ? '' \\n▁ she asked and i looked back up at her . \\n▁ she was still wearing her diner 's uniform and her hair was still pulled back into a falling apart ponytail . \\n▁ she looked tired and worn , but a faint trace of happiness was around her too . \\n▁ nothing obvious , just a crinkle in the lines around her eyes , a slight lifting of her lip , even as her brow bunched together in concern , probably nothing no one but me would even notice . \\n▁ her identical eyes flicked over my face and i quickly answered her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine … just could n't sleep . '' \\n▁ she nodded and brought a hand up to my cheek . \\n▁ she was about to speak when i interrupted her , ` ` was someone here ? \\n▁ i thought i heard a guy 's voice . '' \\n▁ i blushed a bit , at admitting that i 'd been listening , but again , curiosity . \\n▁ her face paled and she dropped her hand from my cheek . \\n▁ she opened her mouth a couple times before answering me . \\n▁ ` ` uh , oh … that was … '' her eyes went over my face faster , and if i did n't know any better , i 'd swear she was searching for a lie . \\n▁ ` ` um , jake … from the diner . '' \\n▁ her face relaxed and she casually tossed a hand in the air . \\n▁ ` ` i had trouble starting my car and he followed me home , just to make sure i was safe . '' \\n▁ she smiled and patted my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i offered him a cup of coffee before he drove home . \\n▁ i ' m sorry if we woke you . '' \\n▁ i frowned as i looked over her face . \\n▁ that seemed genuine enough . \\n▁ i 'd met jake a few times . \\n▁ he was a cook there and always went out of his way to help anybody who needed it . \\n▁ him trailing my mom home , just to make sure she made it back safely , was exactly something he would do . \\n▁ but still , something about the set of her jaw and the glint in her eye was screaming at me - ` do n't ask anymore , just believe me ' . \\n▁ i sighed , thinking my dream had just thrown my senses out of whack . \\n▁ my mom would n't lie about something like that . \\n▁ she may try and hide how difficult her life was from me , but she would never flat out lie . \\n▁ not to me . \\n▁ guilt washed through me that i could n't be more honest with her . \\n▁ i leaned forward and pulled her in for a hug . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't , mom . '' \\n▁ i sighed again . \\n▁ ` ` sorry to spy on you … i just did n't know who was here . '' \\n▁ i tightened the hug and whispered into her hair , ` ` it 's my job to keep you safe , right ? '' \\n▁ she returned my hug and then pulled away . \\n▁ she brought her hand up to my cheek again and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` no , it 's my job to keep you safe . \\n▁ no matter how old you get … you 'll still be my child , and i would do anything for you . '' \\n▁ she leaned into me , her face suddenly intense . \\n▁ ` ` you know that , right ? '' \\n▁ i blinked at her expression and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i know , mom . '' \\n▁ she nodded and relaxed , giving me a kiss on the cheek . \\n▁ ` ` try to go back to sleep , lucas . \\n▁ you need your rest . '' \\n▁ i watched her head down the hall to her room and then turned and closed my door . \\n▁ i had no idea if i wanted to go back to sleep again or not . \\n▁ i did n't want to fight again with darren . \\n▁ i hated that . \\n▁ our time together was a precious thing to me and i hated to waste it , xxunk like catty girls . \\n▁ i shook my head and sighed . \\n▁ well , even picking a fight with darren was preferable to the numbness of my everyday existence . \\n▁ i 'd take the chance in the same way i took a chance every time i closed my eyes . \\n▁ there was always a risk when i dreamed , always a possibility that a pleasant one could morph into a nightmare . \\n▁ like the one i 'd had that had driven me to a regretfully passionate moment with sawyer . \\n▁ a moment that still plagued me , both by how fond the memory was , and how horrid the memory was . \\n▁ i hated hurting or confusing sawyer . \\n▁ she was my best ` ` living '' friend . \\n▁ with what felt like the hundredth sigh tonight , i crawled back into my bed and laid my head back on my arms . \\n▁ i stared at the familiar cracks and fault lines in the plaster . \\n▁ lines i could n't really see in the dark room , but knew were there . \\n▁ spacing out as i mentally traced the lines , i heard a voice beside me quietly say , ` ` you really should fix those one day , lucas . '' \\n▁ smiling widely , i turned my head . \\n▁ ` ` hey , barbie . '' \\n▁ lillian 's pale eyes , gray in the darkness of my room , seemed to glow at me with life . \\n▁ she lightly smacked my arm . \\n▁ ` ` do n't call me that . '' \\n▁ i grinned and leaned in to kiss her . \\n▁ ` ` how about … i love you instead . '' \\n▁ i pulled back to stare at her and she bit her lip before shaking her head and sighing , ` ` i love you too . '' \\n▁ she leaned into me , wrapping her hands into my hair and pulling me on top of her . \\n▁ my hands wrapped around her trim waist and ran up her spine . \\n▁ a shiver ran through me as our suddenly bare bodies pressed together , and with a deep moan , i lost myself in the depth of her sweet kiss . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; there had been a constant chatter around classes . \\n▁ i tuned out most of it , but still caught phrases like : who are you going with ? \\n▁ what are you wearing ? \\n▁ do you think he 'll kiss me ? \\n▁ do you think she 'll put out ? \\n▁ pretty standard pre - dance conversations . \\n▁ i kept my head down and pushed it all out . \\n▁ especially when i heard my own name whispered on more than a few occasions . \\n▁ those i tried to ignore , but it still seeped in : lucas will be there , think he 'll be sober ? \\n▁ think he 'll spike the punch ? \\n▁ will sawyer really stop him from getting drunk ? \\n▁ does sawyer drink too ? \\n▁ should she drink while she 's pregnant ? \\n▁ yeah , there were still pregnancy rumors floating around about us . \\n▁ that would be a pretty miraculous pregnancy on my part , if it were true . \\n▁ thinking about my virgin status , brought my mind back around to lillian . \\n▁ i could n't figure out why the dreams were snapping away from me . \\n▁ i 'd never lost them so consistently in the same place before . \\n▁ it was like she had on an ethereal chastity belt and i was n't being allowed to cross it . \\n▁ i did n't even have anyone i could talk to about it . \\n▁ my mom ? \\n▁ god , no . \\n▁ no way . \\n▁ sawyer ? \\n▁ i only think that conversation would hurt her feelings and make me horribly uncomfortable . \\n▁ my counselor ? \\n▁ no , she did n't need any more ammo . \\n▁ she was already firmly on the ` ` live your life '' soapbox , her and darren both . \\n▁ i sighed and made my way through the living room . \\n▁ i could n't even talk to my best friend about it . \\n▁ not when he was so dead set against it happening in the first place . \\n▁ he thinks it would hurt me more . \\n▁ i do n't see how that 's possible . \\n▁ what could hurt worse than the aching loneliness i struggled through every day ? \\n▁ honestly , i think making love to lil would be the best moment of my life . \\n▁ i tried to push out how sad that statement actually was as i walked into the kitchen . \\n▁ a full pot of hot coffee met me , along with a note : ` had an early meeting . \\n▁ see you later tonight at the diner . \\n▁ ca n't wait to see sawyer all dressed up ! \\n▁ love , mom ' . \\n▁ i half smiled and poured myself a cup . \\n▁ mom , being a typical mom , was all too excited about seeing sawyer and i all dressed up like miniature adults . \\n▁ sawyer had come by last weekend and tried on a few of mom 's dresses . \\n▁ she 'd been reluctant at first , not even wanting to put a few on , but eventually she warmed up and tried on a couple of mom 's more elegant looking ones . \\n▁ mom never got rid of her party clothes . \\n▁ many of them she 'd had since before i was born , but she reasoned that eventually , she may have some reason to wear them and nice dresses were expensive . \\n▁ as i 'd watched sawyer twirl around my mom 's bedroom in a couple , i 'd thought my mom was pretty smart . \\n▁ i sipped my coffee in silence and spaced out as i stared out the window , waiting for sawyer to come get me like she did every morning . \\n▁ our no - touching policy had been more or less going okay . \\n▁ we did n't hold hands anymore and did n't hug or sling an arm around the other . \\n▁ honestly , i missed the contact , but it was n't fair to either her or lil to keep up with the … well , i guess flirting really . \\n▁ not that we 'd been perfect . \\n▁ occasionally we slipped . \\n▁ once , while watching a movie with her -lrb- and watching her more than the movie -rrb- , my hand had acted on its own and reached over the half - cushion between us to grab her fingers . \\n▁ i had n't meant to do that , but once she 'd turned and smiled at me , lacing our hands together , i had n't been able to pull away without offending her and we 'd spent the remainder of the movie that way . \\n▁ then there were the occasional moments where i just needed her to touch me , needed her comforting caress - bad memories , bad dreams , bad encounters with used - to - be friends or , more often than not , bad counseling sessions . \\n▁ well , maybe not necessarily bad , but … hard . \\n▁ wounds and scabs were being lifted and scoured , and i hated it . \\n▁ i hated going and hated speaking , yet found myself saying more and more every session . \\n▁ and mrs . ryans ' favorite subject … was lillian and me . \\n▁ she pried for insight into our relationship daily . \\n▁ seeing sawyer 's car in the driveway pulled my thoughts away from my girlfriend , and finishing my cold coffee , i grabbed my bag and coat and made my way out to sawyer . \\n▁ she beamed at me as i opened the door and sat down . \\n▁ ` ` good morning , lucas . '' \\n▁ i grinned at her happy face , her midnight hair pulled back into an adorable ponytail , showcasing her perfect cheekbones , highlighted in a rosy pink from the chill in the air . \\n▁ i shook my head at her , knowing her grin was because she was picturing tonight . \\n▁ as i returned her greeting and we pulled out of my drive , i hoped all the teasing she 'd endured lately was worth it . \\n▁ i 'd only caught a few glimpses of it , but it was enough to boil my blood and make me worry for her . \\n▁ but she 'd brushed off brittany and her group of tormentors with a chipper shrug , assuring me that we were going to have fun . \\n▁ as i watched the school loom closer and closer in the windshield , i began to wonder . \\n▁ i pushed aside the dread in my belly when i heard her giggle beside me and nearly bounce out of the car once we 'd stopped . \\n▁ she waited for me at the hood and a true smile spread across my face as i joined her . \\n▁ we would have fun … somehow . \\n▁ the buzz around school was just what i 'd expected . \\n▁ the students were so into the upcoming event that i was virtually ignored . \\n▁ aside from an odd look by randy and a suggestive look from brittany , i got through my day pretty much unmolested . \\n▁ josh did n't even look at me . \\n▁ of course , the huge fight i 'd heard him have with his girlfriend in the hallway during break , might have had something to do with that . \\n▁ i 'd only caught the words , ` ` why do n't you take your whore to the dance ? '' \\n▁ before she 'd stormed off and he 'd chased after her . \\n▁ i suspected that maybe josh had gotten caught with his hands on someone else 's merchandise again . \\n▁ mrs . ryans had poked and prodded in our session , but she 'd held back in places she did n't usually hold back , almost like she did n't want to ruin my night by bringing me to an emotional edge . \\n▁ we 'd talked a lot about the dance and about what it meant for me to sort of reenter society . \\n▁ i confessed my fear about the whole matter and she assured me that it was worse in my head than in reality . \\n▁ she 'd again encouraged me to continue to see her after my time was up , and told me i could call her during winter break , if i needed to talk to anyone . \\n▁ she 'd even handed me her business card with her cell phone number written on the back . \\n▁ maybe that was what had opened me up . \\n▁ maybe that 's what had made me ask this as we were parting ways : ` ` do you think life ever makes mistakes ? '' \\n▁ i 'd been looking down , staring at the sharp , right angle of her desk when i 'd asked that and at the silence that greeted my question , i raised my head to find her looking at me with an odd expression , hopeful , yet sad as well . \\n▁ finally she nodded her head and quietly told me , ` ` sure , all the time . '' \\n▁ she sighed and looked down at the pencil in her hands before meeting my gaze again . \\n▁ ` ` some people live who should n't … and even more people die who should n't . '' \\n▁ she gave me a pointed look when she said that and i nodded . \\n▁ something about the sentence nagged at me though , picking at a hard to reach corner of my brain , but i tried to brush it aside when i saw sawyer again . \\n▁ her bubbly excitement eventually drove all the painful thoughts of my friends away , and with her practically giggling that she 'd see me in a few hours , she dropped me off at home . \\n▁ and so , before i knew it , my day was over and i was prepping myself for the big night . \\n▁ it was an even bigger deal for me than just a dance - this would be the first friday night i 'd actually left the house in a really long time . \\n▁ thinking about that , in - between dressing and trying to manage my unruly hair , my stomach starting doing little flip - flops . \\n▁ i pushed aside my fear , as best i could , and after i 'd finished getting ready , i sat and waited for the time to pass by . \\n▁ it took awhile , which the clock on the wall ticking ominously with every achingly long second , reminded me . \\n▁ it felt odd waiting for sawyer to pick me . \\n▁ it felt odd for two very different reasons . \\n▁ one , it felt like i had rewound to this morning , and i was waiting for her to pick me up for school again , and the fact that we actually were going back to the school was n't helping there . \\n▁ second , it felt odd that i was n't driving to pick her up . \\n▁ not that i wanted to drive , not that that was even a possibility - i do n't think i could even gather the courage to start a car , but still , it was the sort of event where a guy should really be doing the picking up . \\n▁ the one bonus of her coming to get me , i suppose , was that i did n't have to face the wrath of her father . \\n▁ maybe wrath is too strong of a word , but she did tell me he had … reservations , about us going to a dance together . \\n▁ sawyer had had to all but promise him that she would n't be opening her legs for me . \\n▁ she had n't exactly put it like that when she embarrassingly told me , but that was the impression i 'd gotten . \\n▁ it made me flush just thinking about it and i was n't sure why . \\n▁ maybe because we 'd finally be breaking our no - contact rule tonight . \\n▁ breaking it repeatedly . \\n▁ we 'd be close , really close … all night . \\n▁ i wiped my sweaty hands on my black slacks and picked up the corsage box , tossing the clear plastic back and forth in my hands , the intricate daisy creation inside it , shifting back and forth . \\n▁ i really should n't be nervous about holding her all night . \\n▁ it 's not like anything was going to happen . \\n▁ i 'd even finally had that conversation with lillian , to assure her that we were just going as friends and it did n't mean anything . \\n▁ she 'd looked away from me after i 'd told her that , and apologized that she could n't be there with me . \\n▁ i 'd held her and kissed her , and told her she was with me everywhere i went . \\n▁ she 'd looked at me sadly and told me i should n't be with her , told me i should be with sawyer , since she was alive and could give me the life i deserved . \\n▁ i 'd told her to stop being ridiculous , and kissed her with as much ferocity as i could muster . \\n▁ she always tried to slip that into our meetings . \\n▁ that what we were doing was n't right , and that i should n't be saving myself for her when i had a living girl right in front of me . \\n▁ i hated when she said that . \\n▁ i hated that even after pouring our hearts out to each other , she still wanted me to end things . \\n▁ i wished she 'd understand that i never would . \\n▁ lights splashed along the kitchen window and i looked up from the table to see sawyer 's car in the drive . \\n▁ i exhaled slowly and stood while i watched her car shut off and her dome light pop on when she opened her door . \\n▁ how cute . \\n▁ she was going to come to the door to get me , just like an actual date . \\n▁ my stomach flopped again . \\n▁ forgoing the warmth of a jacket for style , i grabbed my corsage box and opened the door for sawyer . \\n▁ i held my breath when i took in the sight of her . \\n▁ she looked … like a goddess . \\n▁ she was wearing my mom 's deep , navy blue , velvet , long - sleeved party dress . \\n▁ i ' m not sure what my mom had worn it to , but it was a touch sexy . \\n▁ it was long , nearly draping onto the floor , but not quite reaching it thanks to dark blue , open toed high heels that she 'd also borrowed . \\n▁ the dress flared slightly around mid - thigh , with a slit down the middle starting well above her knee , well above the school 's policy on short skirt lengths . \\n▁ i hoped they 'd overlook it , since it was technically a dress . \\n▁ it hinted at a pair of very shapely legs above the opening and highlighted the very shapely calves when her movements offered a peek . \\n▁ but that really was n't what made it hot . \\n▁ it was the fact that the velvet material clung to every curve of her , and i could n't help but notice something that i 'd never noticed before , something her loose t - shirts and worn jeans had hidden quite well . \\n▁ sawyer … had a really nice body . \\n▁ i felt mine responding , just taking her in , and changed my initial description - the dress was n't just a touch sexy , it was the sexiest thing i 'd ever seen . \\n▁ i tried really hard to forget it was my mom 's . \\n▁ collecting myself , i told her she looked great -lrb- understatement much ? -rrb- \\n▁ and stepped outside , closing the door . \\n▁ she laughed and bit her lip , eyeing me up and down and blushing slightly , telling me i looked great too . \\n▁ i knew i came nowhere near her perfection , what with my basic black pants and lighter shade of blue dress shirt , that complimented her dark shade . \\n▁ we 'd opted for no tie , thank god , and i had on basic black dress shoes . \\n▁ honestly , i could have been going to church and not a semi - formal , but this was how sawyer wanted me , and tonight was mainly for her . \\n▁ a thank you , if you will , for putting up with me . \\n▁ she ran a hand along the side of my hair , fixing a messy piece that had n't been cooperating with me , and i felt my body react even more to her slight touch . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ and we had n't even started dancing yet . \\n▁ maybe having her borrow my mom 's clothes was a bad idea . \\n▁ wanting to be a gentleman , and shut parts of my body off , i gallantly offered her my arm and walked her over to the driver 's side of the car . \\n▁ she laughed delightfully as i helped her sit down . \\n▁ the slit of her dress fell open and i could see a smooth expanse of inner thigh before she adjusted it . \\n▁ my body really liked that . \\n▁ feeling like a moron , i moved around to the passenger 's side . \\n▁ i got in with a frown on my face and stared at her lightly gripping the wheel in her beautiful dress , her thumb ring gleaming in the dash lights . \\n▁ it really was n't very gentlemanly to let her drive . \\n▁ i really should … ` ` lucas , you okay ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ i snapped out of my thoughts , my stomach starting to squeeze at the very idea of switching places , and threw on a smile . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m just not feeling like a very good date . '' \\n▁ i blushed a bit at calling myself her date and indicated her driving , to cover my momentary embarrassment . \\n▁ she looked at herself behind the wheel and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` oh , do you want … to drive ? '' \\n▁ i felt all the blood rush from my face at hearing it said out loud . \\n▁ thinking it was one thing , having it presented to you as a viable option , quite another . \\n▁ i felt my stomach lurch and i heard my heart pound so hard , i was sure she could hear it too in the quiet space . \\n▁ her eyebrows shot up and her hands went to my cheeks , stopping me from repeatedly shaking my head no , which i had n't even realized i 'd been doing . \\n▁ i was breathing heavier as i stared at her intently . \\n▁ she slowly brought me back to a more relaxed state , holding my face and making me keep staring at her . \\n▁ her gray eyes bored into mine - loving , concerned , friendly and maybe somewhere in the depths , something a little more . \\n▁ she 'd applied a dark , smoky eye shadow with long , thick , black mascara , and the stunning grayness seemed to pop out at me . \\n▁ eventually , i felt calm and nodded against her hands , gently releasing them from my face and ignoring how warm her touch had made my skin . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine , '' i muttered . \\n▁ ` ` i better stay over here though . '' \\n▁ i shrugged , feeling stupid . \\n▁ she smiled and fixed my stray piece of hair again . \\n▁ ` ` okay … sorry for asking . \\n▁ that was stupid . '' \\n▁ i looked down , shaking my head . \\n▁ ` ` no … it 's okay . '' \\n▁ i noticed the box in my palms and opened it . \\n▁ with a smile i grabbed her wrist and slipped the flowers on . \\n▁ she stiffened when i first touched her , but smiled when she realized what i was doing . \\n▁ she admired her wrist once the flowers were in place , then she laughed and gave me such a loving look , that an ache went straight through me . \\n▁ i swallowed and shifted my eyes away from hers , sweeping them over the intricate up - do of her shockingly black hair instead . \\n▁ it had been meticulously curled and pinned into place so that most of it was held up , exposing her slender neck , but a few long pieces were left free , and dangled down to tickle the hollow between her shoulder and her collar bone in a nearly intimate way . \\n▁ i swallowed again and forced my focus to the more innocuous windshield . \\n▁ this was going to be a really long night . \\n▁ she started the car and we pulled away , heading for the diner . \\n▁ my mom was overly excited to see us and had offered us a free meal in exchange . \\n▁ since i really had no expertise in cooking , and sawyer had had no interest in my hot pockets , we 'd both agreed . \\n▁ we pulled up to the diner a few minutes later and i smiled as i saw my mom in the large window , talking to a silver haired man sitting alone in a booth . \\n▁ i frowned as i watched her laugh and lean over closer to him , the man laughing as well . \\n▁ i frowned because i recognized the man . \\n▁ sheriff whitney . \\n▁ she was chatting with the sheriff . \\n▁ i sighed , not relishing eating while he was there . \\n▁ painful memories snuck up on me and i brutally beat them back . \\n▁ not tonight . \\n▁ tonight was for sawyer and this moment was for my mom . \\n▁ i was n't going to let my moodiness ruin this evening for either of them . \\n▁ sawyer noticed my frown . \\n▁ ` ` hey , we could go somewhere else if you want . \\n▁ back to your place ? '' \\n▁ i looked over at her ; the perfect heart shape arch of her lip was painted in a pleasing shade of pinkish - red . \\n▁ ` ` no , this is fine . \\n▁ i just was n't expecting … '' i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` this is fine . \\n▁ mom is dying to see you anyway . '' \\n▁ i tucked a stray piece of hair away from her eye , tucking it behind her ear . \\n▁ my eyes swept over her face as my thumb absentmindedly stroked her cheek . \\n▁ ` ` you wo n't disappoint her either . \\n▁ you 're beautiful , '' i whispered . \\n▁ oh my god , lucas , i berated myself . \\n▁ get a grip . \\n▁ i immediately pulled my hand away from caressing her face and cracked open my door . \\n▁ yeah , tonight was going to be a really long night . \\n▁ i told her to stay where she was before i slid out of my door , and grinning like a moron , i skipped over to her side , to let her out of the car . \\n▁ it was old - fashioned and odd , since she had driven , but it made her laugh and reward me with a huge smile , so it was worth it . \\n▁ i held my hand out for her and she grasped it , lacing our fingers as she stood up . \\n▁ i had n't stepped back when i pulled her from the car so we were standing xxunk when she stood up . \\n▁ my heart started racing as that velvet encased body pressed against me . \\n▁ with a content smile , she looked over my face , her eyes flicking between mine . \\n▁ mine were n't so gallant anymore and stared blatantly at her stained lips . \\n▁ she leaned forward and i instinctively leaned down . \\n▁ ` ` luc , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i said breathily . \\n▁ ` ` are you going to let me get out of the car ? '' \\n▁ she gave me a wry grin , her oh - so - cute dimple showing itself . \\n▁ i blinked and realized that my body was trapping her in the open car door . \\n▁ i blushed and let out a nervous laugh as i stepped aside . \\n▁ i heard myself mutter , ` ` sorry , you just look really … good , '' as we walked hand in hand to the small diner . \\n▁ she laughed and told me that she never realized i had a fetish for cocktail dresses . \\n▁ i playfully scowled at her as i opened the diner door . \\n▁ immediately upon entering we heard , ` ` oh my god ! \\n▁ you 're adorable ! \\n▁ are n't they adorable ? '' \\n▁ my mom came up and gave each of us a hug as she beamed at us . \\n▁ as i watched eyes around the diner laser beam onto me , i felt my cheeks flush . \\n▁ not a lot of those eyes thought i looked adorable . \\n▁ mom broke off from hugging me to engulf sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` oh , sawyer , dear , you 're beautiful , just beautiful . '' \\n▁ she looked over her shoulder at the sheriff sitting at the booth next to our display , his gaze firmly on me . \\n▁ ` ` is n't she beautiful , neil ? '' \\n▁ i blinked as i watched the sheriff twist his silver head to glance at sawyer and smile . \\n▁ had my mom really just called him by his first name ? \\n▁ i knew they were friends , well , i mean , i knew they talked , but first names seemed a little disrespectful and it surprised me . \\n▁ his smile shifted to my mother . \\n▁ ` ` she 's lovely . '' \\n▁ his gaze shifted back down to sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` your dress is beautiful on her , vicky . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ did he just call her by her shortened name ? \\n▁ the weirdness just was n't going to stop . \\n▁ before i could comment on it , and really , nerves had already locked up my throat , mom was ushering us to a booth she 'd reserved for us , making elegant looking place cards with our names on them out of comment cards . \\n▁ i smiled at her attempt to make our diner meal a fancier experience , and helped sawyer scoot into her side of the booth before i slide over into mine . \\n▁ sawyer 's dress hitched up her thigh a little when she slid across the vinyl and i suppressed a groan . \\n▁ were the fates trying to kill me tonight ? \\n▁ mom beamed at us as she read off a list of specials , like they were five star xxunk . \\n▁ we ordered an appetizer of chicken strips , burgers for our main course and milkshakes for drinks . \\n▁ mom laughed and rumpled my hair , immediately apologizing and trying to fix it . \\n▁ i sighed and shooed her off with a smile on my face . \\n▁ i watched her head over to a small circle of waitresses and animatedly tell them something . \\n▁ she looked back at us over her shoulder and i knew she was bragging . \\n▁ i smiled as i watched her ; she suddenly seemed ten years younger , laughing and smiling with her friends . \\n▁ those friends were respectfully listening to her , but on occasion they gave me odd , appraising looks . \\n▁ i could almost see their minds trying to match the portrait mom painted of me , to the gossip that ran like wildfire around this town . \\n▁ the two probably did n't mesh up well . \\n▁ feeling like i was being put on trial right here at the table , i stopped watching the group and shifted my attention back to sawyer . \\n▁ she was watching me with a concerned expression and i did my best to relax my face . \\n▁ her hands reached out over the table for mine , and needing the comfort , i reached back for her . \\n▁ we laced our fingers and her thumb started stroking the back of my hand . \\n▁ i ignored the guilt that small gesture gave me . \\n▁ tonight was for her and she enjoyed contact . \\n▁ tonight , i would n't pull away - she could have all she wanted from me . \\n▁ well , up to a point at least . \\n▁ i blushed as i thought about the intimate moment we 'd had a few weeks ago . \\n▁ in my head , i pictured that happening again tonight … with her in that dress . \\n▁ my blush deepened as the image clearly flooded my brain and my clothes were suddenly very uncomfortable . \\n▁ taking a deep breath , i thanked god we were sitting down . \\n▁ i needed to get this under control … and fast . \\n▁ ` ` you alright , luc ? '' \\n▁ she tilted her head at me , some loose pieces of her hair dangling over her shoulder . \\n▁ i smiled and laughed , some of my tension easing . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . '' \\n▁ i looked down at the table and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m great . '' \\n▁ she seemed about to question me , when my mom showed back up with our milkshakes . \\n▁ she smiled softly at our clasped hands as she set our drinks down . \\n▁ i thanked her as i let go of sawyer 's fingers to grab my drink . \\n▁ i watched mom as she smiled at us and then walked over to the sheriff . \\n▁ they talked for a moment while i watched them intently . \\n▁ his eyes flicked over the two booths separating us , staring at me unabashedly and i lowered my head , not wanting to watch anymore . \\n▁ it did n't matter if he was here . \\n▁ i looked up at sawyer , merrily sipping on her shake . \\n▁ she was all that mattered tonight . \\n▁ i reached over and grabbed her free hand again . \\n▁ we chatted easily and mom soon brought our appetizers and main courses . \\n▁ we laughed while we ate , making the meal as fancy as we could with our flimsy paper napkins and plastic basket of fries . \\n▁ pretty soon our meal was done and sawyer got up to fix her lipstick . \\n▁ i smiled as i watched her backside walk to the bathrooms . \\n▁ that dress really was amazing . \\n▁ my focus was suddenly shattered as someone sat down in the booth with me . \\n▁ my face paled as sheriff whitney sat in front of me . \\n▁ i tried to speak , but found my throat locked up again . \\n▁ he tilted his head at me , his aged eyes boring into me . \\n▁ i could tell he was gauging my sobriety and i felt my jaw tighten and my chin lift up . \\n▁ perhaps noticing the defiance in my eyes , he shook his head and smiled softly . \\n▁ ` ` how are you doing , lucas ? \\n▁ i shrugged and mumbled , ` ` fine . '' \\n▁ i was a little surprised any speech came out of me . \\n▁ he nodded and cocked an eyebrow at me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're … okay tonight ? '' \\n▁ i let out a long exhale , calming myself . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine , '' i repeated . \\n▁ he was silent for a moment and then sighed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m just trying to look out for you , lucas . \\n▁ your mom and i both worry about you . '' \\n▁ i bristled at him mentioning himself in the same sentence with my mom . \\n▁ why did she feel the need to confide in a man who brought back such horrid memories in me ? \\n▁ if there was one person i wished i would n't see anymore , it was this man . \\n▁ because even though he was asking about my current level of awareness , and not that night 's , and even though , through everything , he 'd been nothing but nice to me , all i heard in my head when i looked at him was ` they 're all gone ' . \\n▁ i knew it was n't right , but i sort of hated him for it . \\n▁ i did n't say anything to his comment and he eventually sighed again and stood up . \\n▁ ` ` well , have fun tonight , lucas . '' \\n▁ he started to walk away but then turned back to me . \\n▁ ` ` and stay sober . '' \\n▁ okay , that was n't what he said . \\n▁ he 'd said , ` ` and be careful '' , but that 's what i 'd heard . \\n▁ i nodded and stared down at the crumpled up napkin in front of me . \\n▁ i looked up when i felt a hand on my arm . \\n▁ sawyer stood by my side , concern on her face . \\n▁ not wanting to see that look on her anymore tonight , i smiled and stood up , wrapping my arm around her waist . \\n▁ the velvet slid under my fingertips as my hand came to rest on her hipbone . \\n▁ i tried to ignore how much i liked that , as i cheerily said , ` ` ready to dance ? '' \\n▁ she grinned and nodded , and with quick goodbye hugs to my mom , who looked about to cry , we made our way back to her car . \\n▁ i helped her in again , avoiding looking at that enticing slit up the middle of her dress , and then we were off for a night of … fun . \\n▁ i took a deep breath as we pulled into the familiar , but foreign parking lot . \\n▁ i had n't been here at night in so many months , that i 'd almost forgotten how different it could look . \\n▁ the oversized florescent lights spaced sporadically around the lot , lit it in an odd purplish - pinkish wash of color . \\n▁ the edges of the lot stayed pitch black and i knew in the daytime , an empty field surrounded the lot on one side . \\n▁ in the darkness though , all you could see was a sea of nothingness encroaching on the lot , almost as if , at any moment , that inky night would extend its reach and swallow the high school whole . \\n▁ i rolled my eyes and turned my head away from the dark boundaries of the lot as sawyer picked a parking space directly under a pink light . \\n▁ that may be a little over the top of a description . \\n▁ i guess i ' m a little nervous . \\n▁ as i stared out the window at the xxunk dressed people walking arm in arm to the large , square - like lump of a building that the gymnasium was enclosed in , i realized i was n't a little nervous , i was bordering on terrified . \\n▁ a light touch on my arm brought my attention to sawyer . \\n▁ she was relaxed back in her seat watching me with a small smile on her lips . \\n▁ her hand lightly stroked my arm as she softly spoke to me . \\n▁ ` ` it will be okay , lucas . \\n▁ we 'll have fun . '' \\n▁ she looked out the windshield to glance at the dressed up couples then swung her eyes back to me . \\n▁ ` ` just ignore them and focus on me . '' \\n▁ her hand reached up to cup my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` tonight is about you and me . '' \\n▁ her voice was nearly a whisper when she said that and my heart started beating faster for a completely different reason . \\n▁ i gave her a tiny smile and nodded . \\n▁ she was right . \\n▁ this was something she really wanted and i really wanted to give that to her . \\n▁ what the rest of the world thought … was irrelevant . \\n▁ sawyer was all that mattered tonight . \\n▁ i owed her a good time . \\n▁ i owed her a lot . \\n▁ i gave her a look that clearly said ` please let me pretend you need my help ' and opened my door . \\n▁ getting out , i watched her watch me from the window , that small , satisfied smile still on her lips . \\n▁ i opened her door and extended a hand out to her . \\n▁ she giggled as she let me help her up again . \\n▁ it was chilly outside and neither one of us had opted for coats , so we hightailed it to the gym . \\n▁ well , as fast as sawyer could hightail it in that dress and those heels . \\n▁ we approached the front doors with a crowd of people and i felt sawyer 's hand tighten in mine . \\n▁ i looked over at her , but her face showed no strain . \\n▁ if she were nervous for any reason , i could n't tell . \\n▁ we heard the thump of the music before our feet had even crossed over the doorframe . \\n▁ it was loud pop , some sort of top forty hit that must have sprung up over the summer , since i 'd never heard it . \\n▁ i had n't done a lot of music listening in the past few months . \\n▁ sawyer beside me was humming along , so at least one of us was keeping current . \\n▁ we checked in at a small table set up near the doors . \\n▁ oddly , it was being run by purity club members . \\n▁ they had buttons and flyers for people to take and were telling everyone to have a safe night . \\n▁ that was met with a lot of eye rolling and grunts of acknowledgement , but it did n't dampen the member 's spirits . \\n▁ i think a general sense of gloom only spread over the three perky people behind the table when sawyer and i walked up to it . \\n▁ sally happened to be the one checking us in and she gave me a discerning look that was just as obvious to me as the sheriff 's had been . \\n▁ some rebelling part of me wanted to start acting drunk , but i did n't . \\n▁ i stood straight and calmly met her eye . \\n▁ i tried to remember that this girl was sawyer 's friend and was only looking out for her friend 's best interests . \\n▁ i also was looking out for sawyer 's best interests , so i sort of felt bonded with sally … even if she did n't approve of me . \\n▁ she finally nodded us off , telling sawyer she was gorgeous and wishing us both a ` ` safe '' night . \\n▁ she emphasized safe more than she had for any of the other couples and i felt my cheeks heat . \\n▁ honestly , did these people think that i 'd walk into the gym messed up … again ? \\n▁ i already had one strike ; i had no desire to get kicked out of here . \\n▁ the obligatory photo op was setup across from the check - in table and sawyer squealed with delight when she saw it . \\n▁ i smiled at her response and pulled her over there . \\n▁ we stood in line behind a couple that was obviously practicing for where their night was predictably headed . \\n▁ there was deep throat kissing and ass grabbing and general sounds of moaning . \\n▁ it made me really uncomfortable to watch them and i was grateful when it was their turn . \\n▁ when they stepped up to the fake flower arrangement in front of a bland black and white background , sawyer leaned into me and whispered , ` ` do you think they like each other ? '' \\n▁ i looked down at her and chuckled , while ass - grabby couple got their love cemented in an xxunk glossy . \\n▁ i laughed out loud when i saw that the guy was indeed cupping that ass throughout the entire photo session . \\n▁ even though the couple were freshmen , i was suddenly reminded of darren and sammy and stopped laughing , looking away . \\n▁ sawyer tugged on my arm when it was our turn . \\n▁ now , i may have been overly sensitive to the mood of the people around me at this point , but i swear it got pin - xxunk silent when we posed beside our flower potted pedestal . \\n▁ i knew that was n't actually possible with the loud , thumping music coming from the open room next door , but it felt like every human within a twenty foot radius of us stopped breathing . \\n▁ i know i did . \\n▁ sawyer nudged me in the ribs . \\n▁ ` ` hey , relax . \\n▁ you 're gon na break my hand . '' \\n▁ i startled when i realized how hard i was gripping her . \\n▁ i met and held her eye , letting the comfort i found there wash over me , easing the tension in my hand and my body . \\n▁ i heard the click and saw the bright flash of light and sawyer and i both turned to the photographer . \\n▁ ` ` that was perfect , '' he said merrily , ushering us aside for the next couple . \\n▁ ` ` but we were n't even looking at you ? '' \\n▁ i asked , feeling a little stupid . \\n▁ he grinned and shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` trust me , kid , it 's perfect . '' \\n▁ sawyer bit her lip and a flush crept over her face . \\n▁ she smiled up at me and nodded her head to the ordering table . \\n▁ i shrugged my shoulders and followed her . \\n▁ if that was fine with her , then i guess i had no complaints . \\n▁ after i got a packet ordered for her , we made our way to the main gym where i could see the twirling lights and gyrating bodies . \\n▁ as we fully stepped into the room , i could n't help but notice how similar it was to my dream version of it , the night i 'd finally told lillian i loved her . \\n▁ aside from the swarm of bodies , it was so similar , that i nearly expected lillian to walk up to me and ask for a dance . \\n▁ my heart squeezed as i took it all in - the crepe paper , the plastered with glitter snowflakes , the blue and white balloon arches and the stray balloons that had floated up to the high ceiling , the suspended disco ball throwing sparks of light everywhere . \\n▁ ` ` oh , lil … '' i muttered as i looked around , wishing she were here . \\n▁ ` ` what , luc ? '' \\n▁ i looked down at sawyer beaming up at me . \\n▁ guilt forced me to shove aside the painful thoughts i was starting to wallow in . \\n▁ i threw on a smile and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` nothing , '' i attempted to say lightheartedly . \\n▁ she frowned , but then i slipped my arm around her waist and pulled her into my side and she smiled again , resting a hand on my chest as she twisted in my arms . \\n▁ it was closer than we generally were with each other , especially in a crowd this size , but her dress and body pressed against me was sweeping all negative thoughts from my mind and i clung to that , desperate to make this night memorable for her . \\n▁ we moved to a less crowded spot and slunk back into the shadows to people watch for a bit . \\n▁ it was dark where we were and not too many people glanced our way . \\n▁ eventually , she laid her head on my shoulder and i felt her sigh contently . \\n▁ i rested my head against hers and enjoyed her warmth . \\n▁ a few eyes passing close did some double takes , and i knew that before long , everyone would know we were here . \\n▁ it did n't matter . \\n▁ aside from dancing and talking and hopefully laughing , sawyer and i were n't going to be giving them a show . \\n▁ as the music thumped around us and the swarm before us grew in size , encroaching on our peaceful spot and forcing us farther back into the shadows , i started to relax . \\n▁ my thumb lazily drew a large circle over the soft velvet covering sawyer 's hip and her fingernails started lightly stroking back and forth along the fabric of my shirt . \\n▁ it was perfect . \\n▁ it was peaceful . \\n▁ and for the first time since mrs . ryans had suggested the idea , i started to think us being here was a great one . \\n▁ then sawyer 's hand shifted from lightly running over my chest to lightly running over my stomach . \\n▁ her head was still resting on my shoulder and i was pretty sure she was absentmindedly watching the people before us dance , maybe not even fully aware she 'd moved her hand , but i was . \\n▁ her pinky lightly grazed over the button on my slacks and i closed my eyes . \\n▁ it felt really nice . \\n▁ i remembered those hands running up my bare skin and my hand tightened and squeezed her hip . \\n▁ the continual movement of her hand was making a wonderful tension start in my stomach and i kept my eyes closed , focusing solely on where she was touching me . \\n▁ her hand dropped fractionally , subconsciously , and one finger barely touched the top of my zipper . \\n▁ i groaned as my body instantly , and not subtly , responded . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; the driving beat engulfed us , as surely as the driving bodies surrounded us , as we parted the sea and moved to a central location in the pack . \\n▁ i caught a few heads turning and whispering to others around them as we passed , but i ignored it . \\n▁ i let go of sawyer 's hand as we found a place with a little room to move . \\n▁ i was n't really a dancer , but what guy in high school is ? \\n▁ the others around me were doing the ` yeah , i ' m only out here to please my girlfriend in the hopes of getting lucky later ' dance , so i copied them . \\n▁ sawyer however … could move . \\n▁ i found my eyes drifting over that body as she frolicked around to the upbeat song . \\n▁ she sang along and moved her hands through her hair , dislodging a few long pieces , which only made it look even better . \\n▁ a slight flush crept into her cheeks as the heat of the crowd and that long - sleeved dress started to get to her . \\n▁ she was intoxicating to watch . \\n▁ i realized this was n't helping my situation at all and shifted to look out over the crowd . \\n▁ i noticed sets of eyes staring at me , but many more sets were staring at sawyer . \\n▁ most of those sets were guys , and most of those had a glint in them as they watched her body move . \\n▁ a sudden surge of possessiveness washed over me , which actually startled me with an icy wash of astonishment . \\n▁ was i possessive of her ? \\n▁ she was n't mine , by any stretch … but , i did n't want her to get hurt . \\n▁ and as i glared back at a few male eyes , all i saw were jerks and a * * holes who 'd stomp on her heart if given the chance . \\n▁ hell if i was going to give them that chance . \\n▁ they 'd have an easier time getting through her overprotective father than me . \\n▁ a few guys glared back at me , but most turned away and focused on their own dates . \\n▁ a calm , satisfying peace went through me as their eyes left my beautiful friend . \\n▁ not tonight boys . \\n▁ tonight , this angel , for some reason , was mine . \\n▁ a smirk was stuck on my lips for most of the songs after that . \\n▁ finally , a slow song started playing and sawyer smiled and reached out for me . \\n▁ i was n't sure exactly how my body was going to respond to hers pressing up to me , but i could n't deny her what she wanted . \\n▁ not tonight . \\n▁ praying that i could stay in the even - flow i 'd managed to obtain , i smiled and grabbed her waist , pulling her into me . \\n▁ my fingers slid over the crushed velvet of her dress and the contours of her body beneath it were only too obvious . \\n▁ i slid over the lean muscle of the sides of her stomach , around her curved hipbones to the lowest part of her back . \\n▁ as her arms laced around my neck , a few of my fingers disobeyed me and rested along the very top of her backside . \\n▁ she either did n't notice or did n't care , as she gazed at me adoringly . \\n▁ she sighed and tilted her head as we stared at each other . \\n▁ she pulled me tighter , her chest resting flush against mine . \\n▁ those br * * sts i 'd been admiring earlier , pressed firmly against me , made me need to swallow repeatedly and search my brain for something else to think about . \\n▁ not helping the situation any , she started running her hand through the back of my hair , bringing our faces mere inches apart . \\n▁ my eyes drifted to her lips and i knew … i knew this was going to be a bad moment , if i did n't do something to distract myself - and soon . \\n▁ quickly thinking of anything to say to her , i sputtered out , ` ` so , miss i ' m - secretly - obsessed - with - school - dances , how is it you ' ve never been to one before ? '' \\n▁ she 'd let that slip during our planning sessions for tonight and it had surprised me . \\n▁ for someone so into it , i figured she 'd been on the dance committee at her old school . \\n▁ she sighed and looked away , our bodies naturally pulling back from each other . \\n▁ i exhaled a quick breath in relief and then tilted my head at her reaction . \\n▁ she was worrying her perfectly painted lip and staring out over the crowd of intimately dancing couples , but she did n't seem to be seeing any of them . \\n▁ i idly wondered what exactly was replaying itself in her head . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , sawyer … to talk to me . '' \\n▁ i immediately recognized the oddity of me saying that , since i never really opened up to her . \\n▁ she raised an eyebrow as she twisted back around to face me and i thought she probably caught the oddity of it too . \\n▁ she did n't call me on it though , only sighed and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't have a date . '' \\n▁ she shrugged and i frowned at her anticlimactic answer . \\n▁ surely there was more to it than that ? \\n▁ i shrugged as well . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you go alone … or with a group of friends ? '' \\n▁ i knew that some of the girls around here did that occasionally . \\n▁ it seemed socially acceptable for girls to that - girl power and all . \\n▁ if a group of guys did that , well , there was a certain social stigma to it . \\n▁ sawyer looked down before quickly looking back up at me . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't have a whole lot of girlfriends back there and the school instituted a one guy , one girl policy anyway . \\n▁ it had the parents in an uproar at first , '' she shrugged , ` ` but what can you do ? '' \\n▁ i frowned as i considered that . \\n▁ she was still worrying her lip and looking like she really wanted to fess up to something . \\n▁ i would n't normally have pushed , but she looked like she wanted to talk about it , she just was n't quite there yet . \\n▁ i squeezed her waist , drawing her tight to me again . \\n▁ ` ` hey … tell me . '' \\n▁ she sighed again as she looked over my face . \\n▁ i thought her eyes were starting to water , but i could n't really be sure in the swirling light patterns that flashed along our bodies . \\n▁ she opened her mouth and shut it , then opened it again . \\n▁ i waited patiently while she did it again , this time speaking before closing it again . \\n▁ ` ` the boy … the stupid one i told you about … '' her eyes flicked over my face nervously and her voice dropped so low , i had to lean in to hear her over the music . \\n▁ ` ` he … '' i nodded at her and rubbed the small of her back , silently encouraging her to open up to me . \\n▁ she swallowed and then finally did . \\n▁ ` ` he was supposed to take me to junior prom last year . '' \\n▁ she looked away , her eyes definitely shining as she glanced around at the crepe paper and loose balloons . \\n▁ ` ` i was so excited to go . '' \\n▁ she turned her head back to me , the sad smile on her lips unconsciously making me hold her tighter . \\n▁ ` ` he was the most popular guy in our class , and my class alone , was about three times the size of the entire student body here . '' \\n▁ her head motioned around to the suddenly sparse feeling gym . \\n▁ a surge of jealousy flashed through me , but i forced it down and made myself concentrate on her story . \\n▁ she slowly shook her head as she said , ` ` he was handsome and athletic and funny and charming , '' her eyes locked onto mine , ` ` and he told me he loved me . '' \\n▁ that jealousy sprang up in me again , but her lower lip started to tremble , making it shift to sympathy instead . \\n▁ she shook her head again , more forcefully . \\n▁ ` ` i thought i loved him . \\n▁ i adored him . \\n▁ god , i practically worshipped him . '' \\n▁ she looked down at our tightly held together bodies and her voice dropped again . \\n▁ i lowered my head to rest against hers , so i could hear her in the noisy room . \\n▁ ` ` two weeks before the dance , i gave him my virginity . '' \\n▁ she looked up at me and i forced myself to not close my eyes and dwell in the sudden sadness that swept through me . \\n▁ sadness that she was n't at the same level i was , that she 'd been with someone like that before , that someone else had ever touched her that way . \\n▁ but i made myself keep eye contact as her voice quavered horribly with her next words . \\n▁ ` ` i loved him and gave him every part of me … and he … '' her voice and face turned to a mean sneer that i 'd never seen on her , not even when she talked about brittany , '' … he gave me a three on his fuck - o - meter . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open at that and a hard flash of anger burned me . \\n▁ ` ` he what ? '' \\n▁ the moisture in her eyes built up to near flood level as her face softened into sadness . \\n▁ ` ` he was playing some stupid game with his friends , something his brother had picked up at his fraternity . '' \\n▁ her eyes looked over the crowd again as her arms tightened around my neck . \\n▁ ` ` he got points for sleeping with different types of girls . \\n▁ i was a low type . '' \\n▁ she swallowed and lowered her head . \\n▁ i brought my hand up to her chin and made her look at me . \\n▁ our feet slowed to stillness as i held her in my arms . \\n▁ ` ` no , no you 're not . \\n▁ you 're not a low anything . \\n▁ he 's an idiot . '' \\n▁ she sniffled and swallowed back her tears , a light smile playing on her lips . \\n▁ i stroked my thumb along her cheek before returning my hand to her waist , pulling her in for a hug . \\n▁ she returned it , laying her head on my shoulder , her mouth facing my ear . \\n▁ without us looking at each other , she continued . \\n▁ ` ` i found out about it , when i overheard some girls laughing about me in gym class . \\n▁ they said there was a chart in his locker and i was on it , so i busted it open to see for myself … and it was true . \\n▁ he 'd slept with a half dozen other girls while i thought we were a couple , and he ranked them all higher than me . \\n▁ needless to say , i did n't go to the prom with him . \\n▁ i barely went to school after that . \\n▁ i just could n't take the hurt and humiliation . \\n▁ i could n't bear to look at his charming , beautiful face . '' \\n▁ i held her tight when she said that , my hands coming up to wrap over her shoulders , wishing i could wrap myself around her heartache . \\n▁ i 'd never loved someone who 'd used me like that . \\n▁ i almost could n't imagine the torture that must have been for her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry , sawyer , '' i whispered . \\n▁ she sighed and sagged against me . \\n▁ ` ` do you know what the stupidest part is ? \\n▁ i still loved him . \\n▁ i spent weeks wondering what i 'd done wrong , why he did n't love me like i loved him . \\n▁ a part of me wanted to rush over to him and tell him i forgave him for everything , beg him to take me back . \\n▁ but i started seeing him hanging on other girls … and i could n't . \\n▁ i knew i did n't compare . \\n▁ i knew i had no chance . \\n▁ i knew i was worthless . '' \\n▁ i immediately pulled back from her and put both hands on her cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` no , you 're not . \\n▁ do n't ever say that . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , disbelieving that the warm , wonderful person between my hands could ever think they were anything but perfect . \\n▁ she closed her tear - filled eyes and leaned her head against mine . \\n▁ in a whisper she continued with her painful reminiscing . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't handle it all very well and i. . . \\n▁ i did something outrageously stupid . '' \\n▁ her voice lowered even more , to where i could barely make out the words over the blasting song lyrics . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ got … really drunk and … '' she stopped herself and peeked her eyes up at me . \\n▁ biting her lip , she shook her head lightly against mine . \\n▁ ` ` i freaked my parents out and they pulled me from the last few weeks of school , eventually dragging me out here . \\n▁ they thought i 'd do better in a smaller environment , even though it cost them their jobs , their friends . \\n▁ they gave up their entire life back there … for me . '' \\n▁ a tiny smile lit her lips . \\n▁ ` ` i try to never forget that , even when they 're being impossible about our … friendship . '' \\n▁ i smiled with her and dropped my hands to her waist again . \\n▁ she pulled her head back , and her voice took on that wisdom - soaked tone that was too old for seventeen . \\n▁ ` ` this town , this school , was a chance for me to start over and i ' ve never taken that for granted , even when things here have been hard . '' \\n▁ she grabbed a loose piece of her super - black hair , holding a strand up for me . \\n▁ ` ` i did this to remind myself , that i can be anyone i choose to be . '' \\n▁ she looked at the strand and smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m traditionally a mousey - brown kind of color , '' she explained . \\n▁ with a smile she added , ` ` my mom gets a kick out of coloring it for me every few weeks . \\n▁ it 's the one thing we splurge on . '' \\n▁ the smile on my face faded as i thought over everything she 'd confessed to me . \\n▁ i ached with sympathy for her and admired her for her strength , all at the same time . \\n▁ maybe our situations were n't exactly similar , but she 'd certainly dealt with her fair share of torture and ridicule . \\n▁ and here she was , starting over in a new town , determined to make it through each day in any way she could , much like me . \\n▁ my hands slid up to her shoulder blades again , hugging her to me , our heads resting together again . \\n▁ my heart warmed as i held her tight , never wanting to let her go , never wanting her to get hurt again . \\n▁ the music swelled around us and my hand came up to cup her cheek . \\n▁ we inched closer and now every inch of her was pressing against me , head to foot . \\n▁ we 'd stopped bothering to move with the music awhile ago and were just standing still together on the swaying - with - bodies dance floor , holding each other . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry , sawyer . '' \\n▁ i rocked my head against hers as my thumb stroked her cheek , wishing i could stroke away her pain . \\n▁ ` ` i wish i 'd been there . \\n▁ i wish i 'd known you . '' \\n▁ i exhaled softly and ran my finger along the edge of her face . \\n▁ i could see her eyes start to water again as she stared at me . \\n▁ ` ` i wish i could have saved you from that . '' \\n▁ my hand moved around to the back of her head , holding her in place against me . \\n▁ she lifted her chin so our noses rested side - by - side and her breath lightly fanned over me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd never let anyone hurt you , sawyer . \\n▁ i 'd never hurt you . \\n▁ i love you , '' i whispered , my words not making it any farther than the centimeters away from me that she was . \\n▁ i did n't know what i meant by that phrase anymore . \\n▁ i could n't think of anything , other than the overwhelming feelings i had for her . \\n▁ i could n't process anything farther than naming that feeling . \\n▁ her watering eyes threatened to drop that moisture as she held my intense gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , '' she whispered , a tear finally making it down her cheek . \\n▁ i did n't know what she meant by that either . \\n▁ there were so many different levels of love - it was too exhausting to think about it … so i stopped . \\n▁ my hand came back to her cheek , stroking the tear away with my thumb . \\n▁ her lips parted , her breath picking up pace , and my eyes drifted down to the perfect heart arch . \\n▁ i found myself closing the distance between us , my lower lip brushing her upper one . \\n▁ we paused like that , my breath faster , my heart starting to race and my body starting to react again . \\n▁ ` ` lucas , '' she whispered , her lips moving against mine as she spoke . \\n▁ my throat closed on me and my nerves spiked . \\n▁ the pounding in my chest intensified to a level that i thought might be dangerous for me , and the only coherent thing screaming in my head was ` kiss her . ' \\n▁ her body pressed against mine , our lips lightly touching , her thumbs stroking the back of my neck , my free one rubbing against the fabric of her dress . \\n▁ it was all too much for my body - too emotional , too sensual . \\n▁ i could n't help it and i could n't stop it , especially since i 'd been struggling with my hormones all night anyway , and her h * ps pressing against mine were only exacerbating the situation . \\n▁ she gasped softly and glanced down at where our h * ps were touching and i knew she knew . \\n▁ i knew she could feel me becoming aroused by her . \\n▁ embarrassed beyond belief at what i 'd been trying so desperately to hide from her earlier now being exposed , i stepped back , quickly dropping my hands to my sides . \\n▁ surprising me , she stepped forward , pressing herself up against me again and i sucked in a quick breath . \\n▁ ` ` oh … lucas … '' she whispered again , her hand coming up to my cheek , her lips stopping just short of touching mine . \\n▁ my heart thudded in my ears as i debated . \\n▁ as i debated crossing that line again , debated caving to the feeling i 'd been fighting back all night , debated letting her in . \\n▁ finally , i stopped fighting this feeling i 'd been losing against all evening anyway . \\n▁ hating myself , i leaned forward the infinitesimal amount needed to connect our lips , my hands automatically slinking around her waist . \\n▁ the kiss was different from any kiss we 'd experienced before . \\n▁ for one thing , i was in better control . \\n▁ i was n't having an emotional breakdown and i was n't high off my ass . \\n▁ the kiss was light and languid ; we felt each other , we absorbed each other , we learned each other . \\n▁ there was so much emotion in the movement , that i nearly expected tears to spring to my eyes . \\n▁ we broke apart after a moment and as my eyes lazily opened , i focused on the shape of her mouth as she pulled away from me . \\n▁ my eyes slowly lifted up to hers , right as hers lifted to mine . \\n▁ i could see the questions in her depths ; i could see the desire too . \\n▁ i did n't know what to do . \\n▁ i did n't know what was right . \\n▁ all i knew , was that her firm body , wrapped in luxuriously soft velvet , was still making my body react . \\n▁ all i knew , was my breath was faster as i gazed at her . \\n▁ and all i knew , was i missed the warmth of her lips on mine . \\n▁ and i needed that . \\n▁ i needed her back on me . \\n▁ maybe finding an answer to her unasked question , she leaned back in at the exact same time that i did . \\n▁ our lips met in the same place as before , but this time with slightly more urgency . \\n▁ my hand trailed up her spine , straight up the back of her neck to tangle in some loose strands of her up - do . \\n▁ some silky tendrils threaded through my fingers as i moved my hand all the way up to scrunch into the back of her hair , pulling her into me . \\n▁ i did n't care that we were being quite public . \\n▁ i did n't care that everyone in school would know about this after break . \\n▁ for once , i did n't care about the gossip that surrounded us . \\n▁ she was what i cared about - her mouth , her tongue , her breath , her body … her heart . \\n▁ i could n't stop kissing her . \\n▁ i could n't believe she was letting me . \\n▁ i could n't believe i was letting me , but i could n't stop . \\n▁ part of my brain was screaming that it was wrong , really wrong , but as her soft lips moved across mine , all i could think was that it felt so … right . \\n▁ my body was saying that i needed this . \\n▁ that this moment was perfect and my brain should just shut up … and for once , my brain listened . \\n▁ just as her hands were weaving through my hair and our kiss was deepening dramatically , we were suddenly yanked apart . \\n▁ i stumbled as i was forcibly pulled a foot away from her . \\n▁ she stumbled as well at the sudden movement . \\n▁ panicked , i looked over to a smirking mr . varner , who had one hand on sawyer 's shoulder and one hand on mine , prying us apart . \\n▁ i blinked at seeing him holding us ; i had n't been physically pulled away from a girl since the seventh grade . \\n▁ ` ` there is no foreplay on the dance floor . '' \\n▁ he leaned into the both of us . \\n▁ ` ` if you want to have sex , you drive your car to the river , just like all the other kids . '' \\n▁ he chuckled at that and looked me over , concentrating on my eyes . \\n▁ if he 'd had a flashlight , he would have flicked it back and forth over my irises , making sure they dilated properly . \\n▁ i glared back at him , showing him that i was n't under any influences . \\n▁ he smirked again and lightly shook his head before turning and leaving us to our slow dance . \\n▁ i looked back at sawyer , reason returning to me as i did . \\n▁ i should n't have been kissing her . \\n▁ it was still really wrong and misleading and i 'd sworn i was n't doing that tonight . \\n▁ why could n't i ever keep my silent promises to her ? \\n▁ instead of clutching her tight to me again , i kept our distance . \\n▁ i avoided looking at her eyes as guilt washed through me ; guilt for her and guilt for lillian . \\n▁ finally , i looked over my shoulder at the punch bowl on the snack table and muttered , ` ` i need a drink . '' \\n▁ i sort of looked back at her . \\n▁ ` ` want one ? '' \\n▁ with a soft voice , she answered me . \\n▁ ` ` sure … i guess . '' \\n▁ studying the spot in the corner of the gym where the punch bowl was , i extended my hand out to her without looking her way . \\n▁ i felt her grab it and interlace our fingers . \\n▁ embarrassment and guilt prevented me from looking at her just yet . \\n▁ none of that should have happened . \\n▁ i weaved us through the throngs , grateful for the bodies around us that gave me an excuse to not have to engage her yet . \\n▁ i heard a buzzing current of whispers follow us along and i could only imagine the stories i 'd just provided this crowd : ` ` did you hear ? \\n▁ they were practically screwing on the dance floor . \\n▁ i heard luc was so wasted sawyer had to hold him upright . \\n▁ then mr . varner came by and lucas picked a fight with him . \\n▁ god , he was only trying to be a responsible teacher and luc went off on him - you know they had a threesome , right ? '' \\n▁ i sighed and rolled my eyes at all the possible forks the gossip stream could run through . \\n▁ i set my jaw and tightened my grip on sawyer as i pulled us through the crowd . \\n▁ they 'd pick the worst one and run with it - that was just the way it went . \\n▁ the most hurtful comments , the most tortuous situation - whatever was the best scandal , that 's what people would believe . \\n▁ guilt calmed my temper as i thought through what sawyer knew of hurtful gossip . \\n▁ she really was a lot like me … and here i was , dragging her back down into the mud , when she was trying to get her life back together again . \\n▁ i let go of sawyer 's hand when we reached the six foot table with a huge bowl of some pink liquid . \\n▁ sawyer stepped beside me , but i kept my face forward , staring at the stupid bowl , the water slightly sloshing inside from the bass of the hip - hop number pounding in the room . \\n▁ her hand came up and i thought she might swing me around to look at her , but she only reached down to the table , to grab a couple plastic cups from a large stack of them . \\n▁ no one was manning the station , or anywhere near it , so i ladled some punch into a cup when she handed me one . \\n▁ without looking at her , i handed the full cup back to her and grabbed the other empty one . \\n▁ i filled it as well and sighed , hating how i was ruining her night . \\n▁ sure , we 'd been inappropriate and i ' m sure we 'd need to have a conversation about that , but i could n't just ignore her for the rest of the night . \\n▁ had n't i promised that i 'd make this night memorable for her ? \\n▁ that we 'd have fun ? \\n▁ i knew i was n't being much fun at the moment . \\n▁ we stepped away from the table and i finally turned to face her . \\n▁ she was holding her cup in both hands and staring at the liquid inside , one thumb stroking the ring on her other one . \\n▁ i sighed and she looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer … '' my throat suddenly parched , i took a huge gulp of punch , nearly swallowing half the cup in one gulp . \\n▁ that was when my entire night shifted . \\n▁ that was when everything in my body shifted . \\n▁ my throat burned as the huge amount of liquid i 'd consumed traveled down the length of it . \\n▁ i did n't know what i 'd just had , but i knew a large portion of it was alcohol . \\n▁ some idiot had actually spiked the punch bowl . \\n▁ a year ago i 'd of thought it was funny , but a lot had happened in a year . \\n▁ now , as i coughed and sputtered on the potent liquid and sawyer 's brow scrunched together in concern , everything that had happened in that year rushed in on me . \\n▁ more specifically , everything that had happened on that night rushed in on me . \\n▁ it was the alcohol . \\n▁ the smell . \\n▁ the taste . \\n▁ whatever was in there was sending my senses into overdrive . \\n▁ it was the same as that night . \\n▁ it was the exact same stuff darren , sammy and lil had been drinking at the bonfire party . \\n▁ i had n't actually drunk any myself , but my mouth had been all over lillian , and what she 'd tasted , i 'd tasted . \\n▁ that remembered taste and scent flooded my brain as my vision started to swim with the suddenness of the alcohol hitting my system . \\n▁ i stepped back from sawyer and she grabbed my half full cup and set it on the table with hers , confusion and compassion clear in her face as she reached out for me . \\n▁ the memories of laughing , prancing around a fire , lying with lil on the beach , the alcohol on her breath , on her tongue , assaulted me . \\n▁ i could n't shut it off . \\n▁ my stomach rose as i took another step back from sawyer . \\n▁ i could n't control my body . \\n▁ that one dose of alcohol was enough to bring back every horrid and wonderful detail of that night , and i generally tried to keep those memories buried deep within my subconscious . \\n▁ my mind drifted forward in the sudden torrent of reflections - to the onslaught of rain , to the faint yellow stripe in the road , to the squeak of the windshield , to darren 's laugh , to the beer can being passed back and forth , the smell of it reaching me whenever lil handed it to sammy . \\n▁ i leaned over and clenched my stomach , my breath embarrassingly fast , nearly out of control . \\n▁ i was having a panic attack in the middle of the dance , a dance where people were already watching my every move . \\n▁ but my breathing was really the least of my problems . \\n▁ my stomach clenched with a terrible familiarity as lil 's face clouded my eyes . \\n▁ i looked around , knowing i did n't have much time . \\n▁ sawyer 's wide eyes caught mine for a second and she put her hand on my back , asking what was wrong . \\n▁ i could n't answer her . \\n▁ i could n't even speak because my stomach was in my throat , closing off speech . \\n▁ unfortunately , it was n't going to stay there . \\n▁ a wastebasket on one side of the punch bowl table drew all of my attention and i darted over to it , leaving sawyer a few paces behind me . \\n▁ with both hands on the edges , i leaned over and nosily lost my stomach , that vile liquid leaving my system in not one , but three short heaves . \\n▁ i panted over the edge of the basket , feeling my stomach descend to its normal level . \\n▁ the sound of laughter hit me over the music . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and felt my cheeks heat . \\n▁ throwing up in the middle of the gym was not exactly the best way to stay inconspicuous . \\n▁ embarrassment flooded me and regardless of wanting to give sawyer a good time , i suddenly wanted to be gone . \\n▁ maybe trying to rejoin the world had n't been the best idea after all . \\n▁ i felt sawyer 's hands lightly rubbing my back as she leaned over to ask if i was alright . \\n▁ i nodded , still able to hear chuckling going on around me . \\n▁ the can reeked of alcohol now , and leaning over it was going to make me lose it again , so reluctantly , i straightened and faced the music , so to speak . \\n▁ i turned , wiping my mouth with my sleeve , and was met by sawyer 's concerned gray eyes . \\n▁ she ran a hand across my cheek then put the back of her hand against my forehead , like she was checking to see if i was sick . \\n▁ i shook my head and muttered i was fine then glanced behind her at the packed gym floor . \\n▁ several sets of eyes were staring our way , some leaned over in conversation with their partners , others outright laughing . \\n▁ two individuals that were cracking up louder than was really necessary , caught my attention . \\n▁ josh and will were on the edge of the floor , just a few steps away from me , standing together and holding their stomachs they were howling so hard . \\n▁ josh got himself under enough control to give me a twisted sneer , and i had the feeling he was either responsible for the punch bowl or had known about it . \\n▁ either way , he was enjoying my embarrassing reaction . \\n▁ i glanced around the room , full of people that i did n't even feel like i knew anymore , and turned away , needing out of there . \\n▁ sawyer grabbed my arm as i twisted away from her . \\n▁ ` ` where are you going ? '' \\n▁ i glanced around at the masses , their residual laughter still echoing loudly in my ears . \\n▁ ` ` i need … quiet . '' \\n▁ she nodded , understanding , and grabbed my hand , leading me from the room . \\n▁ she led me through a set of open doors into the hallway . \\n▁ the bathrooms were on one end of it and a swarm of students were down there . \\n▁ she pulled us to the other end where the coach 's office was . \\n▁ no one was in that end and it was peacefully quiet . \\n▁ the hallway turned into a short t , with the guy 's locker room on one side and the girl 's on the other . \\n▁ we stopped as we rounded the corner , to the short side of the t by the girl 's locker room . \\n▁ i leaned back against the wall and closed my eyes , wanting to be back at home . \\n▁ a warm hand came up to cup my cheek and i nearly sighed out loud from the comfort in that touch . \\n▁ ` ` you alright , luc ? \\n▁ what happened ? '' \\n▁ i cracked open my eyes , not sure how to explain my latest meltdown . \\n▁ sawyer 's held a depth of emotion in them that made it hard to think clearly . \\n▁ i wanted to confess everything to her . \\n▁ i wanted to tell her everything in my heart and in my soul , but fear locked my throat up . \\n▁ talking about that night was so hard . \\n▁ ` ` luc , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` you can talk to me . '' \\n▁ a corner of my lip lifted at my words coming back to me . \\n▁ guilt washed through me . \\n▁ she 'd confessed something really hard for her to talk about tonight … i should do the same . \\n▁ maybe once we got past that hurdle , everything else between us could be talked about . \\n▁ ` ` i remember everything … from that night . \\n▁ every horrid , intricate detail . \\n▁ i wish i could forget . '' \\n▁ my throat threatened to seize up on me and my heart started racing again . \\n▁ she only stared at me expectantly though , and i flushed , realizing that i 'd never actually said that out loud . \\n▁ i looked down and stammered a few times while she stepped closer , resting her hands on my chest . \\n▁ ` ` it was the punch . \\n▁ josh , or someone , spiked it and it reminded me … it reminded me of … '' my voice trailed off , my throat closing . \\n▁ ` ` it reminded you of that night … the night of the crash ? '' \\n▁ i looked up at her , my face softening with relief that she understood . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i just could n't take it . \\n▁ i could n't stop the memories of the wreck from coming , and i hate thinking about what happened … '' i stared at her , my face paling as i wondered if i 'd just said that out loud . \\n▁ apparently i had . \\n▁ her hand came back to my cheek , her eyes darting between mine . \\n▁ ` ` do you … remember , lucas ? '' \\n▁ she whispered . \\n▁ my mouth fell open and i wanted to scream ` ` yes '' . \\n▁ instead , i floundered for any syllables . \\n▁ ` ` holy crap ! \\n▁ you did show up . '' \\n▁ sawyer and i turned our heads , to look at the voice encroaching on our privacy . \\n▁ it belonged to brittany , who was sauntering out of the girl 's locker room , alone , and stumbling a bit , like she 'd had a few cups of the punch . \\n▁ her honey hair was twisted into a perfectly put together mass of cascading curls and her dress was short and tight . \\n▁ she looked like a million bucks , but i would n't have gone near her if you 'd given me two . \\n▁ ` ` leave us alone , brittany , '' i muttered , my voice cracking as emotions surged through me . \\n▁ she gave me a sneer as she walked up to me , ignoring sawyer standing in front of me . \\n▁ ` ` you think you 're so great , '' she slurred as she stepped into sawyer , causing her to back up a step . \\n▁ sawyer 's face flushed as she glared at brittany . \\n▁ trying to move away from where brittany was now trapping me against the wall , i muttered , ` ` what are you talking about ? '' \\n▁ she put both hands on either side of my body , leaning into me . \\n▁ i instinctively pressed against the wall to get away . \\n▁ ` ` the locker room is empty . \\n▁ we could finally get this … tension between us over with . '' \\n▁ i flicked a glance at sawyer , her face darkened dramatically and her hands clenched into fists . \\n▁ not wanting a fight , i gently pushed brittany away from me . \\n▁ ` ` what do you want with me , brittany ? \\n▁ i do n't get you . '' \\n▁ she stepped back and crossed her arms over her chest . \\n▁ sawyer beside me relaxed her stance and i thought maybe i 'd averted world war xxrep 3 i . \\n▁ brittany gave me a condescending look as her eyes swept the length of me . \\n▁ ` ` you … all those years you acted like you were so much better than me . '' \\n▁ i tilted my head , not understanding . \\n▁ besides our make out session , i 'd barely noticed her . \\n▁ i certainly had never looked down upon her . \\n▁ i just had had other things come up , especially when lil and i got together . \\n▁ ` ` what are you talking about ? '' \\n▁ she stepped up to me again . \\n▁ ` ` you know exactly what i ' m talking about . \\n▁ you were all over me … hot to trot , and then you got all sanctimonious and would n't even touch me , like i was beneath you or something . '' \\n▁ her lip twisted in a sneer . \\n▁ ` ` mr . high - and - mighty quarterback and his barbie doll prom queen . '' \\n▁ she scoffed at me . \\n▁ ` ` like you did n't want to f * * k me . '' \\n▁ her lips curved into xxunk . \\n▁ i rolled my eyes and sidestepped away from her , closer to sawyer who was listening intently . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't ever want to … fuck you , brittany . \\n▁ not even close . '' \\n▁ she snorted derisively . \\n▁ ` ` whatever , lucas . \\n▁ i remember what you were like and i ' m sorry but … '' she ran a hand down my chest and i pulled away , ` ` the way your hands ran up and down my bare body , '' she flicked a glance at sawyer and i suddenly realized with a surge of annoyance why she was bringing this up , ` ` the way your tongue probed my mouth - you wanted me . '' \\n▁ i pushed her back roughly , angry that she was trying to hurt sawyer by bringing up something that had n't really meant anything to either one of us . \\n▁ she stumbled at the sudden move and i thought she might fall , but she righted herself at the last moment . \\n▁ ` ` if i 'd wanted you … i 'd of taken you . \\n▁ god knows it would n't have been hard … half the team did . '' \\n▁ her face paled as she truly did glare at me . \\n▁ with a hardness in her voice , she raised her chin and said , ` ` you ca n't talk to me like that . \\n▁ you 're not a god around here anymore . '' \\n▁ she laughed once with no trace of humor in it . \\n▁ ` ` you had it all , but now , well , you ' ve sunk all the way to the bottom of the social barrel . \\n▁ hell , you 're underneath the barrel , and i find that very … '' she smiled in a not pleasant way , '' … satisfying . '' \\n▁ i grabbed sawyer 's hand , ready to leave brittany 's vitriol . \\n▁ in my irritation , i could n't help but snap back , ` ` and yet , you 're still trying to get me to screw you . '' \\n▁ she sniffed haughtily , stumbling a bit where she stood . \\n▁ i momentarily considered turning her in for being drunk on school property , but immediately discarded it . \\n▁ regardless of what she 'd do to me if the roles were reversed , i was n't going to start turning people in out of spite . \\n▁ just as i pulled sawyer 's hand to leave the hallway , brittany angrily brushed by me , bumping my shoulder in the process . \\n▁ i turned to watch her leave and she paused at the corner to the main hallway , one hand steadying her on the wall . \\n▁ she looked back at me , that suggestive smile back on her lips . \\n▁ ` ` even i do n't mind dumpster diving every once and awhile , luc . '' \\n▁ her eyes lingered down my body before flicking to sawyer . \\n▁ then with a throaty laugh , she disappeared down the hall , presumably to rejoin the dance . \\n▁ i rolled my eyes and shook my head , turning over my shoulder to look at sawyer . \\n▁ i had an apology for brittany 's comments ready on my lips , but the look on sawyer 's face caused them to completely evaporate . \\n▁ her face was pale white and her eyes were starting to water . \\n▁ she stared at the spot brittany had just left us from and chewed on her lip . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer ? '' \\n▁ i said quietly , suddenly very nervous , but wanting to know what she was thinking . \\n▁ i stepped in front of her line of sight and she blinked and looked up into my eyes . \\n▁ i was just about to ask her if she was okay , when she spoke in a shaky voice . \\n▁ ` ` did you … date her ? '' \\n▁ i exhaled slowly , hating brittany for so callously bringing up that brief , pointless encounter . \\n▁ trying to exude nonchalance , i said , ` ` no . \\n▁ we just made out once . '' \\n▁ i shrugged in what i hoped was a casual manner and added , ` ` it did n't mean anything . '' \\n▁ her eyes widened and her mouth fell open a little bit . \\n▁ her cheeks regained some color as her eyes narrowed at me . \\n▁ ` ` did n't mean anything ? \\n▁ do you know how much crap she gives me because of you ? '' \\n▁ i cringed and started to apologize , but she cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` with how she torments me , it obviously did mean something , at least to her . \\n▁ why did n't you tell me you had a history with her ? \\n▁ no wonder she hates me , lucas . '' \\n▁ she shook her head and if i did n't know any better , i 'd swear a flash of jealousy went through her face . \\n▁ but that could n't be , she was so vastly different to me than that sour woman . \\n▁ she could n't possibly be jealous of that meaningless encounter when we had so much … of something . \\n▁ i shook my head and put my hands on her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` no , really , it was nothing . \\n▁ i do n't know why she 's latched on to you … or me . \\n▁ i think it all goes back to lil really . \\n▁ she just hates to lose , and i really did n't pay much attention to her , especially once lil and i started dating . '' \\n▁ i felt like i was n't doing a very good job of explaining and my hands moved up to her cheeks , almost begging her to understand how little brittany meant to me . \\n▁ ` ` but it was nothing , sawyer , just two kids messing around . \\n▁ it was no big deal . '' \\n▁ after i said that , she batted my hands away from her face and her eyes narrowed in anger . \\n▁ i took a step back , surprised at her reaction and wondering what i 'd said to make her mad . \\n▁ ` ` no big deal ? '' \\n▁ she said quietly , a seething undercurrent to her tone . \\n▁ not sure what i was doing wrong , i cautiously said , ` ` yeah . \\n▁ it was just making out … no big deal . '' \\n▁ i shrugged and raised my arms slightly to the sides , hoping she 'd get that i meant that . \\n▁ her face got even xxunk and i suddenly got the impression that i was digging myself into an even deeper hole , i just was n't sure why . \\n▁ her finger suddenly came out to poke in my chest . \\n▁ i frowned at the movement and at her words . \\n▁ ` ` just when i think that you 're different than all the other guys , you go and say something like that , and sound just like them . '' \\n▁ i blinked , hopelessly confused . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer , i do n't … what did i say wrong ? '' \\n▁ she pulled her finger back , crossing her arms over her chest and looking away from me , towards the girl 's locker room . \\n▁ vague sounds of music and people laughing drifted from the other hallway to us , but i did n't currently care about the embarrassing debacle that had driven me out here not so long ago . \\n▁ i did n't even care about the odd exchange with brittany . \\n▁ all i cared about was this woman before me , that seemed to be mad at me for some reason . \\n▁ not turning her head to look at me , she spoke in a tight , controlled voice . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ you said nothing wrong , lucas . \\n▁ i was just wondering … if maybe you came in your shorts for her , too . '' \\n▁ she looked back at me then , her eyes angry , hurt and on the verge of tears . \\n▁ ` ` i was just wondering if that was ` no big deal ' . '' \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; her face paled and she dropped her hands from my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` even me ? '' \\n▁ she took a step back from me . \\n▁ i closed my eyes . \\n▁ once again , i 'd stuck my foot in my mouth . \\n▁ once again i 'd forgotten that she did n't realize how important she was to me , that she was lumping herself in amongst the people i could barely even look at anymore . \\n▁ she was so above them all to me , that it was a little startling that she could n't see that . \\n▁ opening my eyes , i gazed at her heartbroken face . \\n▁ ` ` no , sawyer . \\n▁ i. . . \\n▁ i did n't mean it like that . '' \\n▁ i stepped up to her , wrapping my arms around her waist , drawing her in for a hug that i felt we both needed . \\n▁ she did n't resist me , but she did n't hug me back either . \\n▁ i swallowed back some awful tears , praying that my callus words and actions tonight had n't permanently damaged us . \\n▁ so much for giving sawyer a memorable experience , although , maybe i had succeeded on that point , just not in the way i 'd originally intended . \\n▁ resting my head on her shoulder , i exhaled into the crook of her neck . \\n▁ ` ` honestly , sawyer , you 're my only reason to wake up . '' \\n▁ just as i felt her arms come up to my back , the laughing that had been going on at the far end of the hall was suddenly right next to us . \\n▁ i raised my head from sawyer 's body , wondering who was bugging us now . \\n▁ i felt my grip on her tighten when my eyes received their answer . \\n▁ josh . \\n▁ josh had decided to disturb our heart wrenching moment . \\n▁ swiping a hand across my wet cheeks , i glared at him , not in the mood for any more tormentors tonight . \\n▁ i had n't actually sustained eye contact with him in awhile and he seemed amused that i held his stare . \\n▁ from behind him , i heard will chuckle . \\n▁ my glare switched to will when i heard him seductively say , ` ` hey xxunk . \\n▁ i like your dress . '' \\n▁ he eyed sawyer up and down and i pulled her slightly behind me . \\n▁ sawyer did n't exactly need my protection though . \\n▁ from over my shoulder she told him to f * * k off . \\n▁ his eyes on her turned mean and i put even more of my body in front of her . \\n▁ ` ` what do you want ? '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked between the two of them , but also took in the crowd gathering behind them , clearly expecting a showdown . \\n▁ josh crossed his arms over his chest and sneered at me . \\n▁ ` ` did you like the punch ? \\n▁ we made it just for you . '' \\n▁ i was n't too surprised that my suspicions were correct over the punch bowl , so my expression did n't change any . \\n▁ my words took on a heated tone however , as i spoke loud enough for everyone in the hall to hear . \\n▁ ` ` you drugged me and now you spiked the punch ? \\n▁ you trying to get kicked out of here ? '' \\n▁ josh smirked , his dark eyes glancing behind him at the gathering masses . \\n▁ will beside him shifted uneasily , glancing down at josh and then the crowd , before looking back up to me . \\n▁ josh took a step towards me and a hush went over the tittering crowd . \\n▁ i could hear a flush from the bathrooms in the distance it was so quiet . \\n▁ keeping his voice low and cold , josh said , ` ` no , i ' m not trying to get me kicked out . '' \\n▁ taking another step into me , his finger came up to poke my chest . \\n▁ i stood still , making myself not react to his goading . \\n▁ ` ` but you need a little punishment , so , yeah , i had you drugged by poor , stupid randy … and you ca n't do anything about it , because no one here believes a god damn thing you say . '' \\n▁ he was whispering heatedly , right in my face . \\n▁ i could see the crowd behind him bunch their brows , trying to catch a few words , but they were n't . \\n▁ his confession was only being heard by me , and i already knew it . \\n▁ i roughly pushed him away from me , my control momentarily slipping . \\n▁ his size was nothing compared to mine , so i ended up shoving him back into will . \\n▁ the crowd made a ` here we go ' noise as will helped right him . \\n▁ then will took a step forward , like he was gon na wail on me in josh 's place , but josh held him back with a hand on his chest . \\n▁ will was more my size and a fight between us would be more evenly matched strength - wise , but he seemed to be letting josh take the lead on this fight . \\n▁ maybe he understood that this was something josh and i needed to work out . \\n▁ or maybe he just had a follower mentality and was n't up to taking the initiative . \\n▁ yet another reason he sucked as quarterback . \\n▁ sawyer behind me was not a follower however , and tried to sneak around me to put her own two cents in . \\n▁ i twisted slightly to put my hands on her shoulders , stopping her . \\n▁ josh glared over at her , his eyes narrowing at the evident bond between us . \\n▁ one thing that always seemed to flare josh 's temper was sawyer and i , like he wanted me wallowing in darkness , struggling to hold it together each day , and any glimpse of happiness that i showed was disdainful to him . \\n▁ keeping his hard eyes on sawyer , josh sneered , ` ` even your girlfriend thinks you 're a drunk . '' \\n▁ his tone inflected harshly on the word girlfriend and he almost looked like he wanted to spit at her feet . \\n▁ i think he would have , if we were outside . \\n▁ sawyer bristled in my arms and i held her still , wondering how to get us out of this without fists flying . \\n▁ where 'd all the chaperones go anyway ? \\n▁ josh held his hand out and stared at it , like he was reading a letter . \\n▁ ` ` you were … impaired . \\n▁ i understand . '' \\n▁ he looked up at me , his face gloating . \\n▁ he was talking loud enough for everyone to hear now and a buzz went through the crowd . \\n▁ i looked back at sawyer as his words triggered a memory . \\n▁ he was miming reading a letter and he was implicating my girlfriend , which the school assumed sawyer was . \\n▁ recognition flared in sawyer 's face at the same time it did in mine . \\n▁ sawyer had written that in the note we 'd passed back in forth in english , the day after our ` ` incident '' on the couch . \\n▁ she had n't meant it like josh thought she did , but it sounded bad , really bad . \\n▁ he 'd seen that ? \\n▁ where had he seen that ? \\n▁ did n't sawyer have that note ? \\n▁ i searched her face while she furrowed her brow and stared out over the hall , her eyes flicking back and forth like she was trying to remember what had happened to that incriminating evidence . \\n▁ anger flashed through me at the thought of josh 's eyes on that intimate conversation , which probably meant a good chunk of the school had read it too . \\n▁ sawyer looked back at me , color flushing her cheeks , and i knew she 'd just realized that too . \\n▁ i tried to remember what that note had said , but all i could remember was what we were talking about - our moment of near - sex . \\n▁ i cringed at that sacred moment flying around the school . \\n▁ my self - imposed rule of not ever engaging josh again , vanished in my anger and embarrassment . \\n▁ but more than that , it vanished because i knew how much sawyer would be hurt be the idea of those words swirling out of control . \\n▁ i did n't want sawyer hurt or harassed by josh . \\n▁ i 'd do anything to prevent that . \\n▁ releasing sawyer , i walked up to josh and shoved his chest again . \\n▁ he was more prepared for that and shoved me back . \\n▁ the crowd behind him buzzed with energy and tightened ranks , effectively cutting off sawyer 's and my escape to the gym . \\n▁ irritated at the entire evening i yelled , ` ` i was n't drinking , josh ! '' \\n▁ everyone in that hallway knew exactly what i was talking about . \\n▁ everyone knew i was talking about the night of the crash . \\n▁ the room silenced , expecting an answer to the questions i always dodged . \\n▁ aside from josh and me scuttling back and forth , you could have heard a pin drop . \\n▁ ` ` oh , come on , luc - no one buys that ! '' \\n▁ josh shoved me again , pushing me into sawyer . \\n▁ she stumbled and i twisted to prevent her from falling . \\n▁ i turned my head back to josh when he added , ` ` there 's a witness anyway , luc . \\n▁ someone saw you slamming back beers , so you can stop acting like such a f * * king innocent ! '' \\n▁ a buzz of noise went through the crowd and will beside josh crossed his arms over his chest and met josh 's eye , nodding . \\n▁ several other heads were nodding too . \\n▁ not all , some faces looked surprised , but the majority were not startled by josh 's proclamation . \\n▁ this was apparently something most of the student body had already accepted about that night . \\n▁ i was surprised by it , as i 'd yet to hear it . \\n▁ my face felt like all the blood had rushed from it as i stepped away from sawyer and up to josh . \\n▁ he ran a hand through his dark hair but did n't back away . \\n▁ ` ` what … who ? '' \\n▁ even before i said it , i knew . \\n▁ who else in this school would spread lies and gossip about me , all in the hopes of bringing me down a peg ? \\n▁ who else , but that jealous little bitch . \\n▁ my face twisted into a sneer as i answered my own question . \\n▁ ` ` brittany . '' \\n▁ josh smirked . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember seeing her there now ? '' \\n▁ i ran both hands through my hair and grunted in frustration . \\n▁ i heard sawyer say something behind me , something about brittany being a cunt , but my focus was all on josh and that damn smirking smile on his face . \\n▁ ` ` god , josh ! \\n▁ she 's lying ! \\n▁ you know she 's a liar . \\n▁ she 's always made up crap about me , trying to start shit . \\n▁ she was n't there ! \\n▁ she 's mad at me for ignoring her or something . \\n▁ she was jealous of lil , because i would n't touch her anymore ! '' \\n▁ i knew i was ranting as i practically yelled at josh , the entire crowd listening intently , but i could n't hold it back anymore . \\n▁ ` ` she was n't f * * king there ! \\n▁ no one from school was there ! '' \\n▁ josh stepped up to me , his face as dark as the black on black outfit he was wearing . \\n▁ he poked a finger in my chest again . \\n▁ ` ` how convenient for you . '' \\n▁ i ran my hand through my hair , ruining any semblance of order , and gestured at my chest that he seemed to love poking . \\n▁ ` ` damn it , josh , you know me . '' \\n▁ i frantically patted myself as i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` do i drink ? \\n▁ have i ever been a drunk ? '' \\n▁ he shoved me back , his hands clenching like he wanted to do more . \\n▁ ` ` that night - yes ! \\n▁ there was beer spilled all over you , luc ! \\n▁ my cousin was at the hospital - he says you reeked of it ! '' \\n▁ ` ` it was open in the car , josh , but it was darren 's , not mine . '' \\n▁ i threw my hands up in exasperation and felt sawyer 's come up to rest on my shoulder , trying to calm me down . \\n▁ it worked a little bit and in a quieter voice i said , ` ` why … why do believe the rumor and not me ? '' \\n▁ josh stepped right into my face , his eyes wild with fury and hatred . \\n▁ i barely even recognized the kid i used to know . \\n▁ seething , he screeched , ` ` because you got away with it ! \\n▁ you got away with killing them all ! \\n▁ you did n't even get so much as a fine for the open beer can ! \\n▁ you got away scot - free and everyone knows why ! '' \\n▁ feeling tears sting my eyes , both from anger and sadness , i yelled back , ` ` what the hell are you talking about ? '' \\n▁ sawyer 's hand tightened on my shoulder and i heard her say something about leaving , but josh was in my face and that 's all i could focus on . \\n▁ not backing up an inch , he yelled back , ` ` your mom , luc ! \\n▁ you got away with it because your mom is f * * king the sheriff ! \\n▁ he covered for you , fixed your test at the hospital - all for his whore ! '' \\n▁ that was when i saw red . \\n▁ that was when i did n't care about getting kicked out of this school . \\n▁ that was when i did n't care that sawyer was standing right behind me or that will was on the other side of josh , looking ready to assist if needed , or that a large mass of witnesses was behind them . \\n▁ that was when i did n't care that i 'd made myself a promise to never let josh get the better of me . \\n▁ that was when josh got the better of me . \\n▁ my fist came around and solidly connected with his jaw . \\n▁ i had size and strength behind me , and his scrawny frame was no match . \\n▁ his head jerked around with the hit and he collapsed to the floor . \\n▁ my hand throbbed from the connection but i ignored it , keeping a tight fist for when he stood back up , for when we finally finished this . \\n▁ i stood over him , breathing heavy , as pure venom poured through my veins . \\n▁ ` ` fuck you ! '' \\n▁ he looked up at me , slightly dazed but grinning broadly , a trail of blood dripping from a cut across his bottom lip . \\n▁ he 'd wanted a fight with me for awhile now and he was finally gon na get one . \\n▁ he was small , but he was fast . \\n▁ he sprinted back to his feet and socked me in the gut before i could block it . \\n▁ the crowd behind us started chanting for a fight and i knew this was gon na end with me being evicted from this school forever . \\n▁ i pushed him back as the wind was knocked from me . \\n▁ he made to tackle me , but he was suddenly grabbed from behind . \\n▁ as i panted to get my breath back , i looked over at randy holding josh 's arms behind his back . \\n▁ will glared at randy but made no move to separate the two of them . \\n▁ josh cursed and tried to pull away from the large linebacker , but if he was n't a match for me physically , then he definitely was n't a match for randy . \\n▁ ignoring the look from randy that clearly said ` get the hell out of here ' , i stepped right up to josh 's seething face . \\n▁ rage drove me to my next words and i was n't even aware of saying them . \\n▁ ` ` fuck you and your lies ! '' \\n▁ i glanced up at the sea of faces watching , always watching . \\n▁ as hatred filled me , i did n't even see the xxunk that made them individual people . \\n▁ i only saw a blur of gossiping , heckling , cruel , humanoid blobs in various shapes , sizes and colors . \\n▁ my mind flicked back over the countless times they 'd laughed at me , stared at me , tormented me … i was sick of all of them . \\n▁ ` ` fuck all of you and your lies ! \\n▁ you want to hear what truth sounds like ? '' \\n▁ i stepped back from josh and gestured my hand over the quiet crowd . \\n▁ ` ` here 's some truth - i was n't drunk that night and i remember the whole f * * king thing ! \\n▁ it was n't alcohol that screwed me up , it was the stupid weather . \\n▁ the god damn rain ruined everything . '' \\n▁ my voice cracked and the indistinct shapes watered as my enraged eyes filled with tears . \\n▁ ` ` that damn rain came out of nowhere and hit hard , like someone turned on a f * * king shower . \\n▁ i slammed on the brakes to stop and lost control of the car . \\n▁ i f * * ked up - completely sober and they all died because of it ! '' \\n▁ i gestured at myself with both hands while i screamed at the crowd . \\n▁ ` ` and i wish every day that i 'd died with them ! '' \\n▁ josh had stopped squirming against randy as i 'd begun my rant , and stared at me blankly , his anger seemingly sapped . \\n▁ mine was n't yet . \\n▁ i stepped in his face again and randy dropped his arms from josh and brought those long arms around josh , to my shoulders , warning me to stay back . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't hurt me , josh … because i already wish i were dead . '' \\n▁ i backed away from him as icy realization hit me . \\n▁ i 'd said too much . \\n▁ i 'd said way too much . \\n▁ i felt sawyer 's hands on my back and her sweet voice finally reentered my head . \\n▁ she was begging me to leave with her . \\n▁ i took another step back and looked at josh again and then the hushed crowd . \\n▁ ` ` so just leave me alone , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` all of you . '' \\n▁ i turned to head to the locker rooms , needing to run away from this mess and hide for awhile . \\n▁ immediately coach stepped out from around the corner . \\n▁ his arms were crossed over his school - colored polo shirt and his hard eyes took in me and then the crowd behind me . \\n▁ i knew i was busted . \\n▁ i knew he 'd heard and probably seen that entire fight . \\n▁ my face fell as i realized i was about to be tossed out of here , for good this time . \\n▁ he narrowed his eyes at me as he barred my way . \\n▁ ` ` problem here , west ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , coach , i was just leaving . '' \\n▁ i knew he was n't going to buy that , but what else could i say to him ? \\n▁ he nodded and pointed through the crowd to the gym . \\n▁ ` ` exit 's that way . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open as i stared at him . \\n▁ there was no way he had n't heard me yelling , and there was no way he 'd missed the crowd chanting ` ` fight '' . \\n▁ plus , he 'd already looked over at josh , and his cut lip was a dead giveaway . \\n▁ was he really just going to let me walk ? \\n▁ as i stupidly stared at him , sawyer tugging ineffectually on my arm , his eyes softened . \\n▁ he put a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry i misjudged you , luc , '' he whispered . \\n▁ i could only blink away tears and nod , as i finally let sawyer pull me through the crowd that had started to disperse at the arrival of a teacher . \\n▁ she pulled me past a confused looking will and a sympathetic looking randy . \\n▁ i heard randy mutter something as i passed , but i was too dazed to register the sound and only kept staring at sawyer 's heels in front of me , leading me to freedom from this horrid night . \\n▁ before we disappeared into the gym , i heard coach 's booming voice yell , ` ` not so fast , mccord . \\n▁ i 'd like a word . '' \\n▁ as we hit the loud music and swirling lights of the gym , i was a little startled to see the party still going strong . \\n▁ i felt like my entire world had just started rotating the other way . \\n▁ josh 's words seared my brain , and i could hardly focus on placing one foot in front of the other as i followed sawyer . \\n▁ she stopped mid - gym and turned to me , her hands coming up to cup my cheeks . \\n▁ her eyes were wide and concerned as she flicked between mine , but my head was swirling with so much residual anger and pain that i could n't tell her i was fine . \\n▁ i could n't tell her anything at all . \\n▁ her mouth moved and i heard vague speech , but heated words echoed in my head and i could n't hear hers . \\n▁ ` ` your mom is f * * king the sheriff ! \\n▁ he covered for you … for his whore ! '' \\n▁ sawyer 's face directly in front of me started to get hazy around the edges as i started sucking in faster and faster breaths . \\n▁ i could see her mouthing ` ` breathe , luc '' over and over , but still could n't hear her over the music and josh 's voice in my head . \\n▁ her image started to swim , and panic started to take me . \\n▁ i backed away from her hands holding my face and looked around the gym , looked for something to ground me . \\n▁ all i saw were faces i did n't know - staring at me , laughing , talking , and whispering . \\n▁ their imagined voices filtered into my head - ` ` see him throw up … drunk … loser … saw him pounding beers … his mom screwed … '' i put my hands over my ears to stop the flood of whispers that i was translating into horrid gossip . \\n▁ i turned , and ran right into ms . reynolds . \\n▁ her wide eyes took in my expression and she grabbed my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? \\n▁ what 's wrong ? '' \\n▁ i could only shake my head , barely able to breathe , let alone speak . \\n▁ i broke away from her grasp … and ran . \\n▁ i bumped into quite a few startled couples , but it did n't stop me . \\n▁ i did n't stop until i burst through the main doors of the gym and darted out to the parking lot . \\n▁ i sank to my knees on the concrete , letting the cold , crisp air fill my lungs . \\n▁ it burned painfully , but felt good as i gasped it down . \\n▁ my breath finally evened out as my panic attack started to subside . \\n▁ grief welled in me and i put my head in my hands and let the tears fall . \\n▁ what a mess i 'd made of tonight . \\n▁ i 'd only wanted to show sawyer a good time and here i was , dramatically bawling on my knees in the parking lot . \\n▁ i do n't know how long i stayed there , my slacks getting wet from the cold ground , but eventually i heard two sets of feet hurrying my way . \\n▁ one paused behind me while the other ducked down to my side . \\n▁ arms encircled me and sawyer 's comforting smell hit me . \\n▁ my hands dropped from my face and reached around her waist . \\n▁ i exhaled heavily as i rested my head against her shoulder . \\n▁ she kissed my head before leaning hers against me . \\n▁ i swallowed repeatedly , sucking in the guilt and grief while she rocked me and urged me to let it out . \\n▁ when i felt more in control , i raised my head to look at her . \\n▁ her eyes glistened with sympathy as she returned my gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry i ruined your night , '' i whispered . \\n▁ she shook her head and kissed my temple . \\n▁ ` ` do n't … do n't worry about it . \\n▁ are you okay ? '' \\n▁ i choked back more tears and shook my head . \\n▁ i was n't sure what i was , but i was nowhere near okay . \\n▁ from behind me i heard , ` ` do you want some help getting him home , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ i looked over my shoulder and saw ms . reynolds standing behind us , shivering in her light dress as she vigorously rubbed her bare arms . \\n▁ sawyer glanced at me and i gave her a wide - eyed , pleading look . \\n▁ she understood and shook her head at ms . reynolds . \\n▁ ` ` no , i can handle this , thank you . '' \\n▁ ms . reynolds did n't look convinced , but only nodded her head as sawyer helped me stand up . \\n▁ wanting her to leave us , i tried to throw on a smile . \\n▁ ms . reynolds frowned even more , so i stopped trying to look happy . \\n▁ she sighed and looked over at sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` call my cell if you need anything , sawyer . \\n▁ oh , and tell your parents i 'll come over next week sometime . '' \\n▁ i furrowed my brow at that and ms . reynolds shifted her attention to me . \\n▁ she patted my arm , but looked like she wanted to hug me . \\n▁ ` ` everything will be okay , lucas . \\n▁ have a good break … all right ? '' \\n▁ i nodded stupidly and she turned around and briskly walked back to the warm gym . \\n▁ turning to face sawyer , i could n't think of anything to say to her but , ` ` do you know ms . reynolds ? '' \\n▁ she turned her lip up that that was the first thing i 'd choose to comment on , and sighed , understanding my vague question . \\n▁ ` ` she 's my mom 's second cousin … or something . \\n▁ she agreed to keep an eye on me for her . '' \\n▁ i looked away and nodded , finally seeing why ms . reynolds always seemed to put so much personal attention on her , calling her parents if she skipped pep rallies , frequently keeping her for a few minutes alone after purity club . \\n▁ sawyer had a spy . \\n▁ sawyer 's hand grasped mine and she pulled me toward her car . \\n▁ i glumly followed , hating just about everything that had happened tonight . \\n▁ the pounding music from the gym had faded to nearly nothing once outside , and by the time we got to her car , the night was quiet . \\n▁ i handed her the car keys , having held them for her , since that fabulous dress did n't have any pockets . \\n▁ she opened my door and helped me in like i was a toddler . \\n▁ i hated that she felt the need to mother me after everything that had happened between us , but i silently sat there as she buckled me in and then got in on her side . \\n▁ she took her corsage off her wrist and looped it around one end of her rearview mirror . \\n▁ i watched as she adjusted some of the bent and broken flower petals , thinking those crushed flowers summed up our night pretty well . \\n▁ melancholy swept over me and i stared out the window while she started the car . \\n▁ she did n't move the car though , and i looked back over at her after a few long seconds idling in the parking lot , the heater on high . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer ? '' \\n▁ i said quietly . \\n▁ she did n't answer me at first , only warmed her hands with the blasting heat before turning it down to low . \\n▁ she plucked at a sleeve of her dress and then twisted in her seat to face me . \\n▁ her expression serious , she calmly said , ` ` did you mean it ? '' \\n▁ not knowing what part of the evening she was referencing , i gave her a questioning look and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` mean what ? '' \\n▁ she looked down for a split second before lifting her eyes to mine again . \\n▁ there was moisture in the grayness and i hated seeing it again . \\n▁ i started to reach out for her face , but her words froze me solid . \\n▁ ` ` did you mean that you wish you were dead ? '' \\n▁ her eyes flicked over mine as my stomach dropped . \\n▁ ` ` do you really wish that you were dead every day ? '' \\n▁ that moisture built , welling into a small sea before breaking over the dam and trailing down her cheek . \\n▁ i watched it slither down her skin , wondering how to answer her question in the most honest and vague way . \\n▁ whenever anyone asks that , the answer they expect to hear is ` ` no '' . \\n▁ no , of course i did n't mean it . \\n▁ i was exaggerating , or it was a heat of the moment thing . \\n▁ but for me … i pulled my gaze from her cheek and met her eye . \\n▁ shaking my head , i whispered , ` ` no . \\n▁ i did n't mean it . \\n▁ i do n't wish i were dead … '' not every day … that was the defining point for me , but it was n't one i was about to share with her . \\n▁ the fact was , i did think about death . \\n▁ how could i not after what i 'd endured . \\n▁ immediately after the crash , i had longed for it . \\n▁ i had n't wanted to live in a world without my friends . \\n▁ i never shared that desire with anyone , but it was in me … buried . \\n▁ and on bad enough days , it sometimes resurfaced . \\n▁ sawyer nodded and a light smile lit her lips . \\n▁ she exhaled and her head came down to rest against mine . \\n▁ her hand came up to grasp my cheek and she nodded again . \\n▁ my hand came up to the back of her head and i shifted her to my shoulder , pulling her to me for a tight hug . \\n▁ as we embraced in the pinkish light of the fluorescent bulb above us , the sound of her radio softly playing the only noise , a nagging thought crept into the back of my head . \\n▁ a remembered conversation with my counselor , a feeling that somehow i was missing something horribly simple and all this suffering … did n't need to be happening . \\n▁ but as sawyer pulled away from me , saying that she 'd drive me home now , the feeling passed and a rolling wave of intense anger hit me . \\n▁ i had no desire to go home . \\n▁ not when my beloved mother … was possibly a lying whore . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; walking over the soft , shorter grass of her lawn , i studied the dark rectangles of the bottom level windows . \\n▁ on the very back corner of the house there was one that had been opened for me . \\n▁ i glanced up at the first and second story windows , but everything was still dark inside . \\n▁ no giant - like shadow pacing on patrol , protecting the teenager 's virtue within . \\n▁ although , with what sawyer had confessed to me tonight , my virtue would be the only one left in the house . \\n▁ super . \\n▁ i crouched down at the window and began to slide it farther open . \\n▁ it squeaked horribly and a ` ` s xxrep 3 h '' answered me from inside . \\n▁ trying for silence , i carefully pushed it open the rest of the way . \\n▁ most basement rooms have those odd half windows that push out and make access nearly impossible , but these windows had been converted to more traditional , although , still smaller windows . \\n▁ either her parents or the previous owners had n't wanted whoever lived in these rooms to be trapped down there if there was a fire . \\n▁ the unwelcome side effect of that was evident , as my body just slipped through the opening - a fire escape also served as the perfect ` ` xxunk '' boy 's entrance . \\n▁ i hopped down into sawyer 's room and smiled as i looked around . \\n▁ it was only sort of what i 'd expected it to be . \\n▁ her furniture was white and , although clearly hand - me - downs , were sort of grownup looking . \\n▁ but the curtains and bedding looked like a set for a younger girl , almost pre - teen , with shades of hot pink , neon green , and lavender . \\n▁ the walls were all painted in an infant - like shade of pink , almost like her dad was trying to keep her his baby girl through latex . \\n▁ the half dozen posters of various rock groups tacked up on those pink walls , would make it seem that her dad was failing with that . \\n▁ cds and their cases littered her desk , which had an older looking cd player on it along with her school bag . \\n▁ a bookcase beside her bed was overflowing with books - classic novels , romances , and that writer who wrote those mysteries where all the titles started with a different letter in the alphabet . \\n▁ she had up to m , as far as i could tell . \\n▁ unlike my room , there were no clothes laying around the floor , all of them neatly in her drawers or in her closet , and her bed was neatly made , a faded white teddy bear sitting on her pillow . \\n▁ she grabbed that teddy bear as she watched my eyes linger on it . \\n▁ a faint blush crept into her cheeks as she muttered , ` ` barney . \\n▁ i ' ve had him since i was two . '' \\n▁ she immediately put ` ` barney '' inside her dresser and a corner of my mouth lifted at her embarrassment . \\n▁ turning back to me , she handed me a pair of sweats and a really big t - shirt . \\n▁ i took them and cocked an eyebrow . \\n▁ with a pointed glance at my muddy slacks , she said , ` ` i thought you 'd get a little dirty walking through the fields , so i grabbed some of my dad 's laundry . '' \\n▁ she shook her head and smiled wryly at me , her dimple showing itself . \\n▁ ` ` you look like you found every mud hole . '' \\n▁ i smirked at her and looked back out the pitch black window . \\n▁ ` ` it 's dark out there . '' \\n▁ she nodded and went over to close the window i 'd stupidly left open . \\n▁ ` ` i know … sorry . '' \\n▁ i nodded and smiled back at her , finally noticing that she had changed out of her dress . \\n▁ she was wearing lounge pants with the word ` ` juicy '' across her bottom . \\n▁ that 's what got my attention . \\n▁ she had also slipped on a long - sleeve t - shirt , taken her makeup off and removed the pins from her hair , the dark , freed curls dangling around her shoulders . \\n▁ apparently , i 'd taken awhile getting here . \\n▁ she looked over my face taking her in and explained . \\n▁ ` ` my dad did n't really like that dress , so i got out of it as quick as i could . '' \\n▁ she rolled her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` he was waiting for me in the kitchen . '' \\n▁ a small smile lifted her lips as my eyes widened , wondering if he 'd come check on her while i was here . \\n▁ almost reading my mind she said , ` ` he wo n't come down here . \\n▁ he saw me getting ready for bed , so he wo n't worry about me sneaking out … not that i would . '' \\n▁ she shrugged at that and i quietly nodded , still a little scared to make any noise at all . \\n▁ she laughed at the restraint on my face and then pushed me towards her door . \\n▁ i automatically tensed when she opened it , but it only led to what kind of looked like a tiny living room . \\n▁ there was a love seat and an old tv and a small stack of movies , all of them romantic comedies , a couple with matthew xxunk . \\n▁ from there , she pointed to a room across from the couch . \\n▁ ` ` the bathroom is there . '' \\n▁ she gave me a friendly push and was grinning when i looked back at her . \\n▁ as i walked across the room , i noticed the stairs that led up to the main floor . \\n▁ i kind of felt exposed walking through the line of sight of those stairs , like any minute her dad was going to run down them and fillet me alive . \\n▁ i briefly considered not changing my clothes , so i could make a run for it if needed , but i was pretty dirty , and did n't want to be rude by messing up sawyer 's house . \\n▁ i changed and got ready for bed , nerves creeping up on me at the thought of staying here with sawyer all night . \\n▁ i 'd never spent the night with a girl before , not even lil . \\n▁ not for a full night anyway . \\n▁ not that i had to stay in sawyer 's bed with her or anything . \\n▁ i could crash on her floor , or better yet , the loveseat in the living room . \\n▁ feeling more secure with that idea , i splashed some water on my face , grabbed my dirty clothes , and made my way back to her room . \\n▁ i paused before walking through her doorframe , exhaling a quick breath . \\n▁ she looked up when she saw me , resting a book that she 'd been reading on her knees , the letter l mystery , from what i could just make out on the cover . \\n▁ she flicked the corner of the pages with her thumb and bit her lip . \\n▁ i thought she looked as nervous about this as i was . \\n▁ i set my stuff down on a chair at her desk , leaving my shoes on top of my muddy pants , and pointed with my thumb out the door . \\n▁ ` ` i can … i can stay there … '' she frowned and shook her head , patting the bed beside her . \\n▁ ` ` that couch is awful , really . '' \\n▁ looking down shyly , she added , ` ` you can stay … with me . '' \\n▁ she peeked up at me when she said that and i could clearly see the hope in her eyes . \\n▁ knowing i should n't encourage that hope , i nodded and sat down on the bed . \\n▁ i lay back on the pillows , adjusting my way too big clothes and propping my bare feet up , so my knees stuck up in the air just like sawyer 's . \\n▁ she put her book on her nightstand and shut off the lamp beside it . \\n▁ darkness swept over the room and i looked over to the lump i knew was her . \\n▁ ` ` thank you for doing this for me , '' i whispered into the darkness . \\n▁ i felt her rustle beside me , still not able to see much but a vague outline of her shape . \\n▁ ` ` it 's alright , lucas . \\n▁ i know tonight was hard for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was hard for you too , '' i whispered , the words barely audible . \\n▁ she must have heard me , for her hand reached over and grabbed my arm . \\n▁ her fingers trailed down me until she reached my hand and i laced us together . \\n▁ i felt the bed move as she shifted her body . \\n▁ i could n't see her knees in the air anymore , so i thought maybe she 'd switched to her side to face me . \\n▁ i shifted as well to face her . \\n▁ the night between us made it almost seem like we were the only two people in the world . \\n▁ a warmth and comfort spread over me and i scrunched closer to her in the small bed . \\n▁ i felt the edge of her body , her knees touching my thighs , and sighed softly . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ her voice was directly in front of my face , the minty smell of her toothpaste washing over my skin . \\n▁ ` ` yeah ? '' \\n▁ i felt her sigh and the shape of her head started getting clearer to me as my eyes adjusted . \\n▁ she was silent , not asking me anything , and i studied the darkness , wishing i could see more of her . \\n▁ just when her features started to get clearer , when i could tell that she was biting her lip , she spoke . \\n▁ ` ` is … is lillian the only reason we 're not together ? '' \\n▁ i tensed , not sure how to answer that . \\n▁ finally , feeling that if anything , i owed her the truth , i sighed and said , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ seeing her brows knit together , but feeling safe wrapped in the night around me , i added , ` ` i still see lillian , sawyer . '' \\n▁ i felt a smile come to my lips as i thought about lillian and how close we 'd been lately . \\n▁ how any moment now , we 'd be pushing past that last physical barrier in our relationship . \\n▁ ` ` we 're just like we used to be . '' \\n▁ i searched sawyer 's face , changing from an indistinguishable black to a faded gray as more light filtered through my eyes . \\n▁ her face held a blank look as she listened , a forced blank look , and i sighed . \\n▁ shaking my head , i decided to be as honest with her as i could . \\n▁ ` ` i really hurt her , when she found out about what we … when we … '' her eyes looked down and i knew she knew what intimate moment i was referring to , so i continued without pinpointing it . \\n▁ ` ` you should have seen her face , sawyer . \\n▁ i wrecked her . '' \\n▁ i bit my lip and shook my head , feeling the sudden tears sting my eyes . \\n▁ my voice trembled when i spoke again and sawyer lifted her gaze back to mine at hearing it . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't do that again to her . '' \\n▁ i brought a hand to her cheek , hoping she could see the apology in my eyes , hear it in my voice . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't let anything else happen between us . \\n▁ i ca n't cheat on her anymore . '' \\n▁ she swallowed and her eyes clearly glistened , apparent even in the darkness . \\n▁ ` ` but , we 're not … having an affair or anything . \\n▁ she 's gone , luc . '' \\n▁ i dropped my hand from her cheek and turned my head and body away from her , looking up to her ceiling . \\n▁ a spattering of glow in the dark stars spelled out ' i love you ' right over her bed . \\n▁ i sighed , wishing those words were as simple as they looked . \\n▁ ` ` i have to be faithful to her , she 's my girlfriend . '' \\n▁ my head turned back to her . \\n▁ ` ` and … yes , i know how that sounds . \\n▁ i know i sound completely crazy and that 's why i never talked about this with you before . \\n▁ but it 's still true … it 's how i feel . '' \\n▁ she was silent a long moment and then she propped herself up onto an elbow . \\n▁ ` ` okay , luc . \\n▁ i do n't really understand it and i do n't agree with it … but , i have n't gone through what you ' ve gone through , and i do n't know how i 'd react . '' \\n▁ her voice and face took on that seriousness that i 'd gotten used to over the past few months and i automatically paid even closer attention . \\n▁ she looked down at the inch or two between us and then looked back up to me . \\n▁ ` ` just do n't … do n't use me . \\n▁ if you do n't feel it , that 's fine , but do n't … do n't go there anymore . \\n▁ please . '' \\n▁ i sat up on my elbow as well , twisting to face her . \\n▁ i resisted every urge i had to cup her cheek again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry about what keeps happening between us , sawyer . \\n▁ i ' m not sure what … '' i bit my lip and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` but i ' m not like that a * * hole who used you … and i really am sorry … for everything . '' \\n▁ her eyes still glistening , she nodded her head and sank back to her pillows . \\n▁ releasing our fingers , she rested her head on her curved - back arm . \\n▁ i copied her position and we stared at each other in silence for a few long moments . \\n▁ i felt peace and sleep crawl up on me . \\n▁ after another few silent seconds , she quietly said , ` ` but you do like me ? '' \\n▁ i smiled in the dark , reaching over to squeeze her free hand . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sawyer . \\n▁ i like you … a lot . '' \\n▁ she smiled and looked down , then sadness passed over her face and she turned away . \\n▁ i muttered that i was sorry again and she swallowed and nodded , looking up at the stars over her bed . \\n▁ for a moment , i imagined that she was thinking the exact same thought that i 'd had about love a few moments ago . \\n▁ i squeezed her hand again and she finally looked back at me . \\n▁ ` ` are you cold ? '' \\n▁ i asked quietly . \\n▁ she shook her head , but shivered involuntarily . \\n▁ i gave her a wry grin and then moved to pull the covers back . \\n▁ i climbed underneath and held my arms out for her . \\n▁ i was n't sure what i wanted her to do , i just needed her close . \\n▁ she looked over my face and gesture , and then gave me a soft sigh before crawling under the covers . \\n▁ she twisted , so her back faced me , and i wrapped an arm around her , keeping her warm , keeping her safe , and i prayed , not being misleading again . \\n▁ i felt her body relax into mine and i rubbed her arm , wanting to encourage the comfort that she always gave me . \\n▁ ` ` luc ? '' \\n▁ she twisted her head around to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` yeah ? '' \\n▁ she bit her lip and i thought she was debating whether or not to ask me something . \\n▁ finally she whispered , ` ` you talked about the crash tonight . \\n▁ and you ' ve mentioned … bits and pieces before . \\n▁ do you … do you want to talk about what you remember ? '' \\n▁ i tensed up , but made myself not react negatively to her words . \\n▁ memories rushed through me though . \\n▁ memories of that night and memories of yelling at the students tonight . \\n▁ both were equally horrid . \\n▁ i looked down and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , sawyer . \\n▁ i ca n't . \\n▁ i just ca n't . \\n▁ it 's … too hard . '' \\n▁ when i looked up , i could feel my tears , and knew they were close to spilling over this time . \\n▁ she nodded and immediately said , ` ` you do n't have to . \\n▁ if you 're not ready … you do n't have to . '' \\n▁ i sighed and felt myself instantly start to relax . \\n▁ swallowing , i found her hand again and squeezed it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry if i ruined your big night , sawyer . '' \\n▁ she twisted in my arms , her head turning all the way around , so she was directly in front of my face again ; her breath lightly hitting me again . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't , not really . \\n▁ i still had fun with you … for most of it anyway . '' \\n▁ she shrugged and then gave me an apologetic face . \\n▁ then her eyes flicked down to my chest . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted to show you that school could actually be fun . '' \\n▁ her eyes met mine , looking genuinely remorseful . \\n▁ ` ` i feel like i failed . '' \\n▁ i smiled at her and shook my head , pulling her tight against me . \\n▁ ` ` i had a good time with you … '' i sighed and she twisted around so her back nestled into my chest again . \\n▁ i brought my knees up , so hers curled around me , and lowered my head to rest it against her shoulder . \\n▁ peace and love and warmth flooded through me and i sighed again . \\n▁ ` ` i had a good time with you , sawyer … it was everyone else that i had a problem with . '' \\n▁ she nodded and clutched my arm , bringing it around , so the back of my hand rested against her heart . \\n▁ we were silent after that , all words momentarily spoken , and then sleep found us and we gave into it . \\n▁ the sound of music entered my consciousness first ; hard , thumping music that reverberated through my chest and ear drums . \\n▁ it was loud , much louder than was needed for the large rectangular room . \\n▁ i looked up at the disco ball suspended from the ceiling , spinning so fast the swirling lights were making me nauseous . \\n▁ i looked down at the popped balloons littering the floor , the floor swarming with people , with what looked like the entire student body . \\n▁ i had no idea why i was back at the gym , back at the dance , and why the crowd of people did n't seem to be dancing . \\n▁ they seemed to be forming a tight circle around two people moving back and forth inside it . \\n▁ that was when a slight shock went through me . \\n▁ that was when i saw myself between the cracks of bodies . \\n▁ darren walked up beside me , crossing his arms over his chest and looking at the other me moving around someone else in the circular opening that the student body had left us . \\n▁ i slightly relaxed , registering a dream in progress . \\n▁ ` ` hey , man , '' i said over to him . \\n▁ the music around us suddenly softened and i clearly heard him when he spoke back to me . \\n▁ ` ` josh was in fine form tonight . '' \\n▁ he twisted his lip and shook his head , his dark hair matching the dark mood in his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to have some serious words with that kid , next time i see him . '' \\n▁ i nodded and looked back at the circle , which i could see did include josh as well as me . \\n▁ we were apparently engaged in a screaming match , although i could n't hear it . \\n▁ the sound of the music , while quiet around darren and me , was blocking out all other noise . \\n▁ sammy came up on the other side of darren , leaning around him to nod politely at me . \\n▁ i nodded back and watched , slightly confused , as she turned her golden brown eyes to watch the show with darren . \\n▁ i was n't sure why i was dreaming about this . \\n▁ this was a moment i did n't want to relive . \\n▁ as i was contemplating trying to change the location , i felt lillian step up to my side and grab my hand . \\n▁ i stopped my efforts and turned to smile at her , squeezing her small fingers . \\n▁ she gave me a tiny smile in return and turned to watch the show as well . \\n▁ i glanced between the three of them , not sure why they were so intently watching this , when they knew what had happened - they knew everything in my head . \\n▁ finally , i turned to look as well , my curiosity mixing with apprehension as i watched an angry version of myself yell at josh . \\n▁ i hated seeing myself like that . \\n▁ i hated hearing it too , but unfortunately , i had to - the music had suddenly stopped when i 'd focused fully on the fighters . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not true ! \\n▁ whatever you think you know , it 's not true ! '' \\n▁ josh 's angry , scrawny form stepped up to mine in the circle , shoving me back against the wall of eager listeners . \\n▁ the faces watching us held a look of cruel delight ; they were eating up my torment . \\n▁ sawyer was nowhere in sight . \\n▁ ` ` everyone knows it , luc ! '' \\n▁ he looked over the crowd and they all started nodding and murmuring agreements . \\n▁ he came back to shove a finger in my chest . \\n▁ ` ` your mom is a whore and screwed you out of trouble ! \\n▁ because you are a no - good , worthless drunk , who slaughtered my best friend ! '' \\n▁ my body in the circle paled and cowered , scrunching down among the wall of bodies , looking defeated . \\n▁ i however , was enraged again . \\n▁ i took a step forward , ready to pummel the living hell out of my dream version of josh , when darren suddenly put a hand on my shoulder , stopping me . \\n▁ i looked over at him , but he was still staring at his brother intently . \\n▁ i exhaled slowly and turned to watch as well . \\n▁ the dream version of me sank to my knees , despair appearing to ebb my anger . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry … i did kill him . \\n▁ i did get away with it . '' \\n▁ josh stepped up to me , hands clenched at his sides . \\n▁ ` ` so , you admit you 're a murderer ? '' \\n▁ i watched myself lower my head and then nod . \\n▁ i felt sympathy for that dream version of me , which was an odd thing to feel . \\n▁ i had n't killed my friends in the manner that josh was referring … but i had killed them , and i did sort of feel like a murderer . \\n▁ i felt lillian 's grip on my hand tighten . \\n▁ josh sneered and looked over the crowd . \\n▁ with a triumphant voice , he boomed , ` ` he admits it ! \\n▁ he admits that he killed them ruthlessly , coldly . '' \\n▁ he looked back to me while the crowd booed their opinion of me . \\n▁ when it quieted down , he spoke lowly , ` ` well , what do we do with you now ? '' \\n▁ the crowd started voicing their options , most cruel and most about wanting revenge . \\n▁ i swallowed as i watched the entire student body , and a large section of the faculty too , try me for my crimes against humanity . \\n▁ well , three members of it anyway . \\n▁ josh listened to the suggestions and then came up with one of his own . \\n▁ ` ` i think we do the only fair thing . '' \\n▁ he squatted down and lifted my drooping head . \\n▁ my eyes widened , both on me and on the dream version of me , as i watched his hand swing back , a jagged rock the size of a softball enclosed in it . \\n▁ ` ` eye for an eye … right , luc ? '' \\n▁ i broke free from my friends and darted to the crowd , trying to worm my way through , once i realized what josh was going to do . \\n▁ my friends let me go , but it did n't matter . \\n▁ the mass of bodies eagerly thirsting for my blood were impossible to get through . \\n▁ i pulled and struggled and even punched , but it was no use . \\n▁ they were as effective a barrier as concrete . \\n▁ from over the din , i heard josh sneer , ` ` you want to die every day ? \\n▁ well , today 's your lucky day ! '' \\n▁ through the breaks in people 's bodies , i watched in horror as josh brought that rock around to the side of my head . \\n▁ my dream version of me did nothing , only continued to stare at josh with pathetically empty eyes . \\n▁ i turned away and closed mine when i heard the sickening connection , the wet thud as my brains were bashed in . \\n▁ the crowd around me erupted into cheers and i sank to my knees , no longer able to stand . \\n▁ i felt my chest heave and my stomach rise , and i wrapped my arms around myself , trying to keep it together . \\n▁ then the gym was quiet . \\n▁ then my three friends were the only bodies left in the room . \\n▁ sammy and lillian squatted down on either side of me while darren stood before me . \\n▁ i looked up at him , wondering if my face now matched my pathetic dream version 's face . \\n▁ he sighed and squatted down , placing a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` the dance was awful , luc . '' \\n▁ i swallowed and looked at him and then sammy and my girlfriend . \\n▁ true , the dance had been bad , but nowhere near what i 'd just envisioned . \\n▁ i steadied my breathing as i locked gazes with lillian . \\n▁ her hand came up to stroke my cheek and she gave me a sad smile . \\n▁ i nodded as i held her gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i tried . '' \\n▁ ` ` you did n't try hard enough , luc . \\n▁ you handled that badly . '' \\n▁ i looked back up to darren after he said that . \\n▁ ` ` i handled it the best i could , darren . '' \\n▁ i looked back to the empty gym floor behind me , almost expecting to see my blood everywhere . \\n▁ ` ` i handled it better than that . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you ? '' \\n▁ he asked and i twisted to give him a sour face . \\n▁ he shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` you let them xxunk you . \\n▁ you let them pick on you . \\n▁ you let them make you a victim . '' \\n▁ his eyes flicked over to where josh had just killed me . \\n▁ i bristled at that and stood up . \\n▁ ` ` i told them what happened . \\n▁ i told them about that night . \\n▁ does n't that count for anything ? \\n▁ is n't that what you all want from me ? '' \\n▁ sammy stood and put a hand on my arm . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a start , luc . \\n▁ but you did that to push people back . '' \\n▁ she shook her head , her auburn hair flashing red where the lights hit it . \\n▁ ` ` you did that to force people away , not bring them closer . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , not understanding . \\n▁ ` ` i spoke … is n't that enough ? '' \\n▁ lillian put her other hand on my other arm , her pale hair a sharp contrast to sammy 's . \\n▁ ` ` no , luc . \\n▁ you need to stop being defensive and start letting people in . \\n▁ like sawyer . '' \\n▁ i pulled away and stared at the three of them , irritated and slightly scared . \\n▁ ` ` what is this ? \\n▁ some sort of ethereal intervention ? '' \\n▁ the three of them looked between each other and then back to me . \\n▁ there was a solidarity in their silence that unnerved me . \\n▁ finally lillian was the one that spoke , and she did it like she was speaking for the group . \\n▁ ` ` lucas , we 're just worried for you . \\n▁ we want you to be healthy and happy … and you 're not . '' \\n▁ i shook my head and grabbed her hands , holding them up to me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m happy . \\n▁ i ' m happy here with you . '' \\n▁ i looked over at darren and sammy . \\n▁ ` ` with all of you . '' \\n▁ darren clapped my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` but your real life is suffering because of it , luc . \\n▁ holding us tight is pushing everyone else away . '' \\n▁ i shook my head again , but sammy spoke before i could argue . \\n▁ ` ` look at randy , luc . \\n▁ you did n't even hear his apology … and i ' m sure there are others who want to befriend you , that you do n't even see . '' \\n▁ darren took up her speech . \\n▁ ` ` because you go through every day in a daze , only thinking about how to pass the time , so you can come here again , to be with us . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open as i stared between the two of them . \\n▁ ` ` so ? \\n▁ what 's out there that is better than what 's in here ? '' \\n▁ aside from watching myself get stoned to death , of course . \\n▁ lillian 's voice was soft in my ear , but struck me to my core . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer . '' \\n▁ my head snapped back to her , my eyes watering . \\n▁ knowing my physical body was currently spooning with sawyer , i felt guilt creep through me . \\n▁ ` ` no , lil . \\n▁ i told her no . '' \\n▁ her answering smile was a sad one . \\n▁ ` ` exactly , lucas . '' \\n▁ one of her hands released mine to come up and touch my face . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't push away a chance at real love for the twenty minute encounters you get with me . '' \\n▁ her pale blue eyes watered , but it was mine that finally broke down . \\n▁ tears streamed down my cheeks as i responded to that . \\n▁ ` ` those twenty minutes are worth it . '' \\n▁ i looked over all of them , desperation clear in my face and voice . \\n▁ ` ` you 're all worth it . \\n▁ please … '' they all looked at each other again , sammy 's tears flowing as freely as mine . \\n▁ darren sniffed and stared at the ground and a soft sob escaped from lillian . \\n▁ i suddenly got the feeling that this was n't just another ` lucas must live ' speech . \\n▁ i suddenly got the feeling that they were giving me a goodbye speech . \\n▁ ice shot through every nerve in my body . \\n▁ ` ` do n't do this … '' my voice was barely a whisper , but they all turned their attentions back to me . \\n▁ ` ` please , '' i added , my voice strained with tension . \\n▁ sammy stepped up to me , throwing her arms around my chest . \\n▁ ` ` oh , lucas . \\n▁ you know how much i love you , right ? '' \\n▁ i swallowed and shook my head , momentarily dropping lil 's hand so i could clutch sammy 's arms . \\n▁ ` ` no , please … no . '' \\n▁ the tears dripped from her cheeks as she started to lightly sob . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , lucas . \\n▁ you need to let us go if you 're ever going to heal . '' \\n▁ her hands grabbed my face . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too much to let you slowly fade away because of us . '' \\n▁ she kissed my forehead and i felt the burn of it run through me . \\n▁ i started panicking . \\n▁ ` ` no , please , sammy . \\n▁ i 'll do anything … anything . \\n▁ just stay … '' she sobbed again , resting her head against mine . \\n▁ ` ` you were the best , luc … and i want you to be that man again . '' \\n▁ then she vanished and i was clutching air . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ no , please , sammy . '' \\n▁ i tried to mentally bring her back , but nothing was happening . \\n▁ i could n't control anything . \\n▁ darren stepped up to me , his eyes watering as he watched my frantic face search for his disappeared girlfriend . \\n▁ his arms came around me in a hug and i momentarily forgot my horror at sammy leaving . \\n▁ a new horror struck me . \\n▁ my mouth dropped open again as i clutched his shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ you ca n't leave ! \\n▁ not you ! '' \\n▁ my voice broke . \\n▁ ` ` you 're my best friend and best friends do n't leave ! '' \\n▁ he shook his head , tears finally making it to his cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` i already left you , lucas . '' \\n▁ his eyes flicked over the sob filled room , sobs i realized were coming from me . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't real , man . '' \\n▁ i clutched at him , trying to physically restrain him from abandoning me . \\n▁ ` ` no … no , i wo n't let you . \\n▁ you have to stay . '' \\n▁ a soft sob escaped him as he ignored my attempts to keep him in place and hung his head . \\n▁ ` ` we should have done this awhile ago . \\n▁ maybe it would have been easier for you back then . '' \\n▁ he lifted his head as i vigorously shook mine . \\n▁ ` ` and that 's what matters , luc . \\n▁ you . '' \\n▁ his hands came up to grasp my face . \\n▁ ` ` you 're the only one left . \\n▁ do n't forget that you lived . \\n▁ i love you , luc . '' \\n▁ feeling him slipping , i started repeating ` ` no '' over and over . \\n▁ it did n't matter … he faded right before my eyes . \\n▁ a sob tore through me and i felt a piece of me shatter . \\n▁ darren had been my best friend since we were five years old . \\n▁ there was n't a monumental moment in my life that he had n't either been a part of , or i had n't told him about , even after his death . \\n▁ i could n't comprehend a lifetime without seeing his friendly face . \\n▁ arms swept around me then and my sobs started coalescing together into one long grief - filled wail . \\n▁ if i could n't comprehend a life without darren , then a life without lillian … i spun and pulled her to me , determined to make her stay . \\n▁ i needed her . \\n▁ she was my air . \\n▁ i could n't function without her . \\n▁ i was frantic in my desire to keep her near me , pulling at her clothes and hair and arms . \\n▁ she calmly shushed me and tried to still my body . \\n▁ her hands came up to my face and she cupped my cheeks , making me stare at her , making me calm down . \\n▁ when i could breathe more normally , i whispered , ` ` please , not you … please . \\n▁ do n't leave me … '' she closed her eyes , tears falling . \\n▁ ` ` luc … '' i shook my head , panic flaring . \\n▁ ` ` no , no , no … i ca n't do this on my own . \\n▁ it 's too hard . \\n▁ i need you , lillian . \\n▁ i 'll change , i 'll be better … i 'll do anything . \\n▁ just stay … i need you to stay . \\n▁ i love you . \\n▁ i love you so much . '' \\n▁ her eyes opened and she kissed me softly . \\n▁ ` ` i know you do , luc , and i love you too . \\n▁ that 's why i have to do this . \\n▁ but you wo n't be alone . \\n▁ you 'll wake up , and sawyer will be in your arms … waiting . '' \\n▁ i rubbed my forehead back and forth across hers , not wanting to hear it . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ i do n't want to wake up ! \\n▁ i want to stay here with you . \\n▁ please ? '' \\n▁ she shook her head against mine . \\n▁ ` ` and that 's exactly why i ' m doing this … why i ' m not staying . '' \\n▁ i pulled back to stare at her , my eyes wide with the pain slicing through me . \\n▁ ` ` but why ? \\n▁ we 're so close … we ' ve gotten so close . '' \\n▁ i kissed her over and over , hoping i could convince her just how right this was . \\n▁ ` ` i want you … forever . \\n▁ you 're mine . \\n▁ i want to show you . \\n▁ i want to make love to you . '' \\n▁ she pushed me back , making me stop . \\n▁ ` ` no … it 's not real . \\n▁ it wo n't help you . \\n▁ you need to be with someone real . '' \\n▁ tears dripped repeatedly from her face and i could tell this was killing her to say these things , but right now , my pain was so incomprehensibly great , that i could n't even care about hers anymore . \\n▁ ` ` how can you do this to me ? \\n▁ you said you 'd never break up with me … you lied . '' \\n▁ she swallowed , a sob escaping her . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … do n't … '' i gripped her arms roughly , feeling like i had a way to make her stay … even if it was a manipulative one . \\n▁ ` ` no , you promised . \\n▁ you said you 'd never leave . \\n▁ you said you 'd always stay by my side . \\n▁ and i demand that you keep that promise . '' \\n▁ my voice broke as i horribly twisted the tender words that she 'd spoken over our time together . \\n▁ twisted them into weapons - weapons designed to hurt , weapons designed to stake her to me with guilt . \\n▁ she sobbed again as she met my eye . \\n▁ ` ` oh , luc , do n't … '' she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` darren 's right , we 're already gone . \\n▁ i ca n't break up with you if i ' m already gone … '' i shook her arms , knowing that i was probably bruising her . \\n▁ ` ` and yet you are . \\n▁ i ' m not breaking up with you ! \\n▁ you 're the one betraying me ! '' \\n▁ a look flashed across her face once i 'd said that and i immediately recognized my mistake . \\n▁ i 'd misfired my weapon , so to speak , because she was n't the one that had betrayed the relationship . \\n▁ that had been me . \\n▁ a moment of anger seeped into her features as she knocked my hands away from her arms . \\n▁ ` ` no , i did n't betray you . \\n▁ i never would . \\n▁ but i ca n't stay here with you . \\n▁ i wo n't do that to you … or sawyer . '' \\n▁ there was strain in her voice as she spoke , and a clear note of jealousy as she said sawyer 's name again . \\n▁ the guilt swept through me , taking my momentary strength with it . \\n▁ i engulfed her in an embrace . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry … please do n't go . \\n▁ please do n't walk away from me . \\n▁ i need you . \\n▁ i need to be with you . \\n▁ please … '' she stiffened and then relaxed , wrapping her arms around me and threading her fingers in my hair . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry too , lucas . \\n▁ i love you … always , but i ca n't be this person for you . \\n▁ we ca n't be together … not while you 're still alive . '' \\n▁ then she vanished . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; ` ` i need to go home … can you take me ? '' \\n▁ she stood , putting a hand on my arm and looking out the window . \\n▁ it was still fairly dark outside , but the sun had risen and an amber light was starting to brighten the world . \\n▁ she turned back to me and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` my parents probably wo n't be up yet . \\n▁ i 'll just leave a note , telling them that i wanted to return the dress as soon as possible . '' \\n▁ i nodded , barely hearing her as my thoughts swirled . \\n▁ i was n't sure why i wanted to be home , but honestly , i did n't know where to go to make this despair that was building inside of me end . \\n▁ home seemed as good a place as any . \\n▁ i changed back into my dirty clothes while sawyer dressed in the bathroom . \\n▁ when she came out , she looked me over and then gave me a swift hug before grabbing my mom 's dress and telling me she 'd meet me outside by her car . \\n▁ i felt myself nod in response , but my entire body was sort of slumped down . \\n▁ i felt defeated . \\n▁ i felt like that dream version of me that had gotten his head bashed in by josh . \\n▁ only this time , my best friends had done the bashing . \\n▁ when she disappeared up the stairs , i crawled out the window . \\n▁ i glumly walked over to her car , opened the unlocked door and got inside , not really caring if her parents spotted me out here or not . \\n▁ she came out her front door a few moments later and joined me . \\n▁ i could feel her eyes on me , but i ignored it , studying the muddy stains on my knees instead . \\n▁ one kind of looked like the rock josh had killed me with last night . \\n▁ she cleared her throat . \\n▁ ` ` luc … '' i did n't respond and she sighed then started her car . \\n▁ i did n't look up as she turned her car around and started out to my house . \\n▁ i did n't even look to see if her parents had heard her car start and turned on their bedroom light , wondering what their baby girl was up to . \\n▁ i just could n't find it within myself to care anymore . \\n▁ ` ` we ca n't be together … '' time flashed forward in an almost surreal way , and what seemed like only seconds later , she was shutting her car off in my driveway . \\n▁ i blinked and looked over at her . \\n▁ she looked worried and i wondered if i still looked like death , or maybe like the undead would be a better description . \\n▁ like my body was being animated by some mindless creature , for certainly my soul was gone . \\n▁ my friends had succeeded in ripping that to pieces . \\n▁ what months of torture at the hands of josh and the townspeople had n't accomplished , my friends had managed in one night - they 'd shattered me . \\n▁ broken my spirit and left me billowing in the wind … alone . \\n▁ sawyer said my name again and again , but i still did n't respond . \\n▁ i did n't know what to say anyway . \\n▁ was there anything i could say that would n't hurt her further ? \\n▁ was there anything i could say that would n't hurt me further ? \\n▁ i grabbed my mom 's dress from the back seat and turned away from her , opening my door . \\n▁ she mildly surprised me by opening hers as well . \\n▁ some tiny speck of my brain wanted her to rush home before her parents discovered she was missing … the majority of my brain did n't care anymore . \\n▁ she followed me to my doorstep , saying my name a couple more times . \\n▁ each time the syllables crossed her lips , more tension crept into her voice . \\n▁ i still remained silent . \\n▁ i remained silent until i walked into the living room , tossing my mom 's dress on the couch unceremoniously . \\n▁ it was my mom that broke my silence . \\n▁ she stormed down the hall once she heard the front door open . \\n▁ her eyes were wide and red as she met mine . \\n▁ i gazed at her blankly , remembering all the vile things josh had yelled at me about her . \\n▁ i did n't know if they were true … but i had a horrid fireball twisting in my stomach that they were . \\n▁ that expanding ball burned away some of my melancholy , as it thawed some of the ache around my heart . \\n▁ i narrowed my eyes at her as she stormed right up to me . \\n▁ ` ` mother , '' i said flatly . \\n▁ she ignored my tone and flicked her eyes up and down me , like she was searching for injuries . \\n▁ ` ` are you just getting home ? \\n▁ where have you been ? '' \\n▁ her hand flashed back to my bedroom . \\n▁ ` ` i just went to check on you before i had to leave on an errand , and your bed had n't been slept in . '' \\n▁ a tear rolled down her cheek as her voice hitched . \\n▁ ` ` do you have any idea how terrified i was , lucas ! \\n▁ where were you ? '' \\n▁ i heard sawyer behind me shift and clear her throat . \\n▁ she started to say my mom 's name , but i cut her off . \\n▁ ignoring my mom 's question , and the tears on her worn face , i calmly said , ` ` is n't it a little early for errands ? '' \\n▁ that startled my mom and she pulled her head back , appraising me . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ i just had something i had to … '' her hand came up with a parental ` ` listen to me '' finger wag . \\n▁ ` ` do n't distract me by changing the subject - where were you ? '' \\n▁ i cocked my head to the side , deciding to set the tone for this conversation by being honest . \\n▁ maybe if i did it , so would she . \\n▁ ` ` i spent the night at sawyer 's house … in bed with her . '' \\n▁ i heard sawyer gasp behind me at how i 'd phrased our innocuous sleeping arrangement . \\n▁ mom paled and glanced back at sawyer , clearly not expecting my admission , and being a little surprised by it . \\n▁ she stuttered a bit as she considered what to say on the matter . \\n▁ curious , i let her flounder for words , not clarifying what we 'd actually done … or had n't done . \\n▁ ` ` well … i do n't … you ca n't … you 're too young . '' \\n▁ her face turned considerably pinker as she looked back at sawyer . \\n▁ i did n't look with her , but i was pretty sure sawyer was bright red . \\n▁ the anger - despair mix in my belly prevented me from feeling guilty about that . \\n▁ mom turned back to me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're both too young for that , lucas . \\n▁ we should … sit … and talk … '' her voice trailed off as i smirked . \\n▁ ` ` about what , mom ? \\n▁ sex ? '' \\n▁ i shrugged after i said that , not feeling the embarrassment those words spouted at my mom would have normally given me . \\n▁ i felt sawyer put her hand on my arm . \\n▁ she 'd apparently caught up to where i was going with this conversation . \\n▁ ` ` luc … do n't . \\n▁ not like this … '' i heard her mutter lowly . \\n▁ my mom heard her too and shifted her gaze . \\n▁ i brought her identical eyes back to mine with my next comment . \\n▁ ` ` what can you teach me about sex , mom ? \\n▁ especially about not having it ? '' \\n▁ i crossed my arms over my chest and leaned back on a hip . \\n▁ sawyer begged me to stop this , but i could n't . \\n▁ if i shut off the flood of anger i was feeling towards my mom … the grief would wash back in , and drown me . \\n▁ i sniffed and waited for her answer . \\n▁ her face paled again as she looked over mine . \\n▁ she licked her lips and smoothed back her ponytail . \\n▁ all signs of guilt . \\n▁ my eyes narrowed further as her actions more and more confirmed my suspicions . \\n▁ ` ` what are you talking about , luc ? '' \\n▁ i leaned into her and she took a step back . \\n▁ ` ` what errand were you running ? '' \\n▁ she narrowed her eyes and shook her head . \\n▁ i took a step towards her , ignoring sawyer 's plea for me to step outside with her . \\n▁ ` ` did you have another early morning meeting to get to ? '' \\n▁ sudden memories of her anxiously waiting for sawyer to pick me up , or her dashing out of the house nearly an hour before her shift , flooded my brain . \\n▁ the pieces were starting to fit . \\n▁ ` ` you look tired … anymore late night visitors keeping you up ? '' \\n▁ that memory flooded me too , and i wondered who really was here that night … and if that had been the first time , or just the only time i 'd heard it . \\n▁ she took a step back , shaking her head and stammering . \\n▁ ` ` what are … ? \\n▁ why are you … ? \\n▁ what are you really asking me ? '' \\n▁ her voice was barely audible . \\n▁ i took another step towards her . \\n▁ sawyer begged me not to say it , but i needed to know . \\n▁ i needed the truth . \\n▁ i said it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m asking you , if you 're f * * king the sheriff . \\n▁ if you 're the whore that everyone thinks you are … '' i really had n't been sure if the rumor josh had ruthlessly spouted was true or not . \\n▁ lord knows lies spread like wildfire around here , but the pieces had started fitting more and more with each passing second - the morning meetings , laughing with the mysterious late night visitor , the looks that passed between my mom and him at the diner , the familiar use of their first names , odd , too friendly touches , his frequent visits over the summer , the way he always called me lucas , when everyone else was referred to by last name … the way he said he 'd look out for me the night of the crash . \\n▁ if it was true , then it all made sense now . \\n▁ and as i watched my mom 's face pale to a near ghostly white , her mouth dropping open and her eyes starting to water , i knew that it was true . \\n▁ my mom was sleeping with the sheriff . \\n▁ no , sleeping was a misnomer ; my mom was screwing the sheriff , no sleeping involved . \\n▁ her momentary shock wore off and her face suddenly hardened , her hands clenching into fists like she wanted to hit me . \\n▁ she took a step towards me until she was right in my face . \\n▁ i did n't back down . \\n▁ ` ` you do not talk to me that way , lucas michael west ! '' \\n▁ sawyer pulled my shoulder back and i could hear her lightly crying . \\n▁ i ignored it and focused on the woman before me , who had been my shining example of what a human should be . \\n▁ she looked faded to me now . \\n▁ ` ` but it 's true ! \\n▁ is n't it ! \\n▁ you 're sleeping with him and that 's why i ' m not in jail ! '' \\n▁ she held her breath as she took a step away from me . \\n▁ i could see the debate in her eyes . \\n▁ she 'd lied about this for so long , that she still naturally wanted to lie about it . \\n▁ fire burned even hotter in me that she 'd even consider lying to me now . \\n▁ she looked over my heated expression and finally let out a long exhale , stepping back again as her shoulders slumped in defeat . \\n▁ barely above a whisper , she murmured , ` ` yes , lucas … it 's true . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open and a slice of pain went right through me . \\n▁ even though i knew … it was hard to hear it . \\n▁ i shook my head , feeling sawyer 's hand on my shoulder turn comforting . \\n▁ in a softer voice i said , ` ` how could you ? \\n▁ how could you lie to me … all this time ? '' \\n▁ she dropped her head , and as more amber rays lit the room , i could see a sparkling tear drop to the floor . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … you would n't understand . '' \\n▁ my fists clenched as pain shifted back to anger . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right , i do n't . \\n▁ did you start something with him , just to keep me out of trouble ? \\n▁ was that the deal ? '' \\n▁ her head shot up and i felt sawyer rest her head on my arm and ask me to be gentle . \\n▁ i ignored it and focused on the suddenly irate eyes before me . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ there was no … deal . \\n▁ i did n't ask him to do anything , luc . '' \\n▁ she shook her head and flung her hands out to her sides . \\n▁ ` ` we were together long before … '' my eyes widened at that and she stopped talking . \\n▁ ` ` you were together before … ? \\n▁ how long have you … '' i could n't even comprehend that my mom may have been lying to me for … years . \\n▁ her entire body slumped and she sat heavily onto the arm of the couch , her hands momentarily coming up to cover her face before dropping into her lap . \\n▁ ` ` we ' ve been seeing each other for five years , luc … '' her eyes aged another decade as she looked up at me . \\n▁ my entire body slumped at her words . \\n▁ i thought i might drop to the ground , but sawyer ducked under my shoulder and somehow i remained upright . \\n▁ five years ? \\n▁ she 's been lying to me since i was twelve ? \\n▁ slowly shaking my head , i could only say , ` ` mom … he 's married … '' she dropped her head and a sob escaped her . \\n▁ sawyer patted my chest as i watched my mom 's tears fall . \\n▁ the fire in my stomach twisted into something putrid and painful . \\n▁ i felt like i might be sick . \\n▁ i felt like i wanted to run . \\n▁ why was everyone i believed in letting me down ? \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc … that 's why i had to lie . '' \\n▁ she looked back up at me , hers eyes begging for my understanding . \\n▁ ` ` i hated to do that to you , but you were so young . \\n▁ i could n't tell you … '' sawyer murmured that she should leave us alone and i grasped her hand , hard . \\n▁ i could n't take her walking out that door right now . \\n▁ sensing that , she stayed . \\n▁ drained and confused , i could n't take standing in place any longer either . \\n▁ i shuffled over to the couch , dragging sawyer with me , and sat down heavily into the spot farthest from my mom . \\n▁ she immediately turned on the arm to plop onto the cushion , twisting to face me . \\n▁ sawyer knelt at my feet , resting her head on her arm over my legs , giving me what comfort she could . \\n▁ unconsciously , i put my hand on her back , drawing warmth from her , since i felt like i had none of my own left . \\n▁ a horrid , silent tension built in the room as everyone looked at me , waiting for my reaction . \\n▁ feeling numb , i could only stare at my mom blankly . \\n▁ not knowing what else to comment on , i picked the one thing that seemed the most irrelevant . \\n▁ ` ` he 's so much older than you , mom … like fifteen or twenty years . '' \\n▁ she blushed and looked down at the cushion separating us . \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc . \\n▁ that does n't matter to me . '' \\n▁ she looked back up at me and whispered , ` ` i love him . '' \\n▁ i shook my head and looked down to sawyer , who was looking up at me with wet , concerned eyes . \\n▁ i stroked her back while i thought of my mom getting it on with a man who could almost be my grandfather . \\n▁ it was n't a pleasant thought and it did nothing for my stomach . \\n▁ i could barely believe that this was reality . \\n▁ it felt like life was the dream , the nightmare . \\n▁ the one person who had been my example of morality my entire life , was having an affair with a married man . \\n▁ it blew my mind . \\n▁ i knew my dad was a louse , but my mom … ? \\n▁ maybe i 'd put her on a pedestal , but up until know she 'd deserved one . \\n▁ up until now , she 'd been a saint . \\n▁ i looked back over at her . \\n▁ ` ` it 's like i do n't even know you … '' i whispered . \\n▁ her eyes were pained as she softly sobbed my name . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … '' i shook my head , ignoring the ache in my heart , concentrating on the fire . \\n▁ ` ` what about his wife ? \\n▁ how could you do that to her ? '' \\n▁ my brows bunched together as i pictured the sheriff 's gray - haired spouse , home alone , watching the windows and waiting for her faithful public servant to return to her . \\n▁ i wondered if she knew that her public servant was routinely ` ` protecting and serving '' my mother . \\n▁ my mother sniffed and met my eye . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not proud of this , lucas , and we certainly did n't plan to fall in love … '' she shook her head as another tear fell to her cheek . \\n▁ ` ` it does n't excuse it … but his wife has been really sick for years . \\n▁ he takes care of her the best he can , but there has n't been anything between them for a long time . '' \\n▁ her eyes gave me that pleading look again . \\n▁ i narrowed my eyes at her , shaking my head . \\n▁ ` ` they 're still married , mom . \\n▁ he should divorce her if he wants to be with you . '' \\n▁ she sighed . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not that simple , luc . \\n▁ he does love her … in a way , and she 's very frail . '' \\n▁ she shook her head , a clearly adoring look washing over her . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't want to risk her health by turning her world upside down . \\n▁ we keep it quiet and discreet , so she can live out whatever life she has left in peace . '' \\n▁ i gave her a blank stare . \\n▁ ` ` oh . \\n▁ my . \\n▁ god . \\n▁ you 're one of them . '' \\n▁ she blinked at me , cocking her head . \\n▁ i gestured a hand at her disdainfully . \\n▁ ` ` you 're one of those women that believes everything the philanderer says … because he ` loves ' them , and surely he 'll eventually leave his wife . '' \\n▁ i could n't even hide the contempt leaking into my voice and sawyer tightened a hand on my knee . \\n▁ ` ` do n't tell me you seriously believe that line ? '' \\n▁ my mom 's gaping mouth shifted from sawyer , to me , and then back to sawyer . \\n▁ finally she looked up at me and sputtered , ` ` it 's not a line . \\n▁ he does … he does love me . \\n▁ he 's been good to me . '' \\n▁ her eyes hardened as they swept over my face . \\n▁ ` ` and very few men in this world have been good to me ! '' \\n▁ i turned away from her clear reference to my long absent father . \\n▁ his leaving had scarred my mom in ways i probably could n't imagine . \\n▁ although , with how my chest still felt like the insides had been scooped out with a dull spoon , i was more and more beginning to understand the pain of being abandoned . \\n▁ seeing my reaction to her words she whispered , ` ` he 's a good man , lucas … maybe you could give him a chance ? '' \\n▁ my head snapped back to her . \\n▁ ` ` oh yeah , a real shining example . '' \\n▁ even as i said it , i could feel the hypocrisy in my words . \\n▁ was i really getting after a man for cheating on his significant other ? \\n▁ had n't i done the same ? \\n▁ had n't i betrayed lil by making out with sawyer ? \\n▁ sure , we had n't technically had sex , but it was one of the most intimate moments of my life … and i 'd hurt someone i loved by doing it . \\n▁ who was i to condemn the sheriff ? \\n▁ or my mom … i closed my eyes as thoughts of lillian swarmed through me . \\n▁ ` ` we ca n't be together … '' i felt the despair creeping back , my eyes starting to sting , and frantically grabbed at the lingering fire in my system - anything to hold back the crushing pain . \\n▁ my mother 's irritated voice helped stoke that fire , and i reopened my eyes to find her nearly glaring at me . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't expect you to understand … you are only a child . \\n▁ but someday , you might . '' \\n▁ i bristled at her condescending use of the word ` child ' and felt my hand clench the fabric of sawyer 's shirt . \\n▁ her hand came up to stroke my arm in response and i relaxed my grip , never taking my eyes off my mom 's . \\n▁ her face softened as she slumped into the couch . \\n▁ ` ` where did you hear about it ? '' \\n▁ keeping my voice flat , i told her , ` ` at the dance . \\n▁ people know … they all know … '' i was n't actually sure how widespread the rumor was , but it sure explained why people did n't believe i was innocent . \\n▁ they believed my mom 's lover had covered it up … they just had n't had any proof . \\n▁ she closed her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` oh god … '' i looked over the defeat on her face , and thought about how the town viewed me , how josh viewed me - a monster , a horrid creature , that had slain my friends and walked away with absolutely no consequences . \\n▁ staring straight ahead of me , i whispered , ` ` are you why i did n't get in trouble ? '' \\n▁ i heard her answer me but did n't look over , instead keeping my eyes focused on the empty space on the wall above the television set , a spot that used to hold pictures of my friends and i , before mom had taken them all down . \\n▁ ` ` oh , luc … you tested clean at the hospital … '' i finally did look over at her . \\n▁ she was worrying her lip and searching my eyes . \\n▁ her small hands were clasping each other so tight , they were nearly white . \\n▁ ` ` there were a half - dozen things he could have charged me for . '' \\n▁ i shrugged my shoulders , irritated and pained at talking about that night . \\n▁ ` ` we had an open beer in the car , mom . \\n▁ he should have given me a xxunk at the very least , reckless driving at the most , or even , i do n't know , manslaughter . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ her gaze turned sympathetic and she stretched her arm across the space between us to touch my shoulder . \\n▁ i made myself not pull away . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … you just lost your friends , he did n't feel like he needed to punish you even more . '' \\n▁ then i did pull away , giving her an exasperated look . \\n▁ ` ` mom ? '' \\n▁ she let her hand drop to the couch and she hung her head . \\n▁ sawyer squeezed my knee again as my mom whispered , ` ` i do n't know , luc … maybe . '' \\n▁ she looked up , more tears falling from her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't ask him to . '' \\n▁ so there it was . \\n▁ i was n't being punished for my horrific crime because my mom was spreading her legs . \\n▁ a part of my brain knew i was n't being fair , a part of my brain knew i was xxunk things , but the fire in my stomach pushed all those rational thoughts aside . \\n▁ my despair crept up my chest to merge with that fire shooting through my veins . \\n▁ ` ` i murdered all my friends and got away with it because of you ! '' \\n▁ i heard my mom and sawyer start to object to the word ` ` murder '' , but i cut them off , ` ` no wonder everyone hates me ! '' \\n▁ rage , fear , panic and depression , flooded all of my senses , and i stood up and turned to face them on the couch , feeling like nothing was real anymore . \\n▁ i glared over at my mom . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't supposed to happen that way ! '' \\n▁ sawyer stood and placed her hand on my chest , begging me to calm down . \\n▁ my mom stood and put a hand on my arm , her eyes begging for me to relax as well . \\n▁ ` ` i know , lucas … none of it was supposed to happen . '' \\n▁ i took a step away from both of them , running my hands through my hair . \\n▁ i felt like i was going to explode . \\n▁ everything i knew was falling apart . \\n▁ i hated this … i hated life . \\n▁ i wanted my dream life again , but even that was gone from me now . \\n▁ everything was gone … ` ` we ca n't be together … while you 're still alive … '' that was when my brain snapped . \\n▁ i swear , i felt the exact moment that some neuron misfired and a section of my head imploded , as the emotional strain heaped upon it finally broke me . \\n▁ it was a profoundly intense experience for me , and in that moment of xxunk , a moment of clarity hit me . \\n▁ words from my counselor that had been nipping away at my subconscious suddenly bloomed into life right before my eyes . \\n▁ they mixed with lillian 's last fateful words and suddenly , i understood what i 'd been trying to grasp . \\n▁ suddenly , i knew exactly why everything in my life was such a challenge - why everything was so hard . \\n▁ ` ` do you think life ever makes mistakes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` sure , all the time . \\n▁ some people live who should n't … and even more people die who should n't . '' \\n▁ i knew mrs . ryans had meant to stress the latter half of that sentence , but it was the first half that had plagued my brain . \\n▁ it was the first half that now made perfect sense to me when put in combination with lillian 's words . \\n▁ of course , it was all so obvious now . \\n▁ some people live who should n't . \\n▁ i was never meant to have survived that crash . \\n▁ life had made a mistake . \\n▁ one that i could fix . \\n▁ letting my hands fall to my sides , i looked from one woman to the other . \\n▁ clarity and determination filled me . \\n▁ i could fix this . \\n▁ i could correct life 's mistake . \\n▁ i could find peace . \\n▁ fixing my gaze on my mom , i calmly told her , ` ` no … my living was n't supposed to happen . \\n▁ i was never supposed to have survived . '' \\n▁ her mouth dropped , her face going whiter than it had all morning , and she sputtered for words . \\n▁ i did n't let her find any . \\n▁ i immediately turned to sawyer , thrust my hand into her jeans pocket and wrapped my fingers around her car keys . \\n▁ before she could react , i jerked my hand out of her pocket , told her i was sorry , and bolted for the front door . \\n▁ i heard both of them tell me to wait as i jerked the door open . \\n▁ i heard the tension and concern in their voices and i heard a long sob as the door slammed shut behind me . \\n▁ but it did n't matter , it was too late . \\n▁ an error had been made , a grievous one , and i could n't let it go unresolved . \\n▁ it all made sense now . \\n▁ why i could n't fit in at school . \\n▁ why i could barely talk to anyone , save sawyer . \\n▁ why at times , i barely even felt human anymore . \\n▁ i 'd survived something i was n't meant to . \\n▁ i actually had died that day in the ravine . \\n▁ my soul , my spirit , my life - force - whatever you want to call it , had moved on , but somehow , my body had walked away . \\n▁ i 'd been drifting aimlessly , torn between the two worlds . \\n▁ i 'd tried to fill the void in my life by recreating my friends in a dreamscape , but that was only a patch , and they were right anyway . \\n▁ i could n't continue on like that . \\n▁ i needed to fix what life had messed up . \\n▁ i needed to be with them … fully . \\n▁ ` ` we ca n't be together … while you 're still alive … '' soon lil … very soon … i scrambled down the front steps , flipping the keys for the one that looked like a car key . \\n▁ i found it and clutched it hard , feeling the unforgiving metal bite into my skin . \\n▁ i opened an unlocked car door and blinked when i realized i 'd automatically opened the passenger 's side . \\n▁ i 'd been so used to not driving , that it was now going to have to be a conscious decision to do it . \\n▁ i swallowed and stared at the steering wheel . \\n▁ of everything i was going to do today , this would probably be the easiest . \\n▁ my heart still spiked though . \\n▁ i slammed shut the door and turned to sprint to the other side . \\n▁ that 's when sawyer caught up to me . \\n▁ she slammed into my body , knocking both of my shoulders back until i sat down onto the hood of the car . \\n▁ my mom stood a few paces behind her , fear in her eyes and tears on her cheeks . \\n▁ i startled at my new position and looked up at sawyer , kind of irritated . \\n▁ she was irritated too , but i saw the fear behind it . \\n▁ i saw the abject terror brimming behind her watery eyes . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ her voice was forced , like she had really wanted to yell that at me . \\n▁ i stood up and put a hand on her shoulder . \\n▁ she pulled back from me , trying to keep her glare , trying to hold onto her anger , so she would n't break down . \\n▁ i completely understood that feeling . \\n▁ i 'd done it myself only moments ago . \\n▁ checking my emotions , i was a little surprised that both my anger and my fear had dissolved . \\n▁ i felt nothing but peace . \\n▁ i hoped sawyer would understand why i had to do this … she really was the best thing i had here , but i could n't stay . \\n▁ i was n't meant to . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer … i have to do this . \\n▁ please , try and understand . '' \\n▁ my voice was as calm and peaceful as i felt , but sawyer only gaped at me , looking hopelessly confused and scared . \\n▁ i brought my hand to her cheek , her tears falling now . \\n▁ my mother broke out in a sob and jabbed her finger at sawyer . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m calling sheriff whitney ! \\n▁ do not let him leave until neil gets here , sawyer ! '' \\n▁ she turned and dashed into the house , and i knew the timer on how long i had to leave had just been set . \\n▁ i could fight off sawyer and my mom … but the sheriff ? \\n▁ ` ` lucas … '' she muttered , her hand coming up to my chest , clutching at my stained dress shirt . \\n▁ i remembered then that i was still dressed nice and a small smile touched my mouth . \\n▁ fitting . \\n▁ i should be dressed nice for this occasion . \\n▁ it was sort of a special day . \\n▁ at least i 'd looked good when i saw lil again . \\n▁ now i sort of wished i 'd gone with a tie after all . \\n▁ sawyer frowned at my smile and i lightly shook my head , resting it against hers . \\n▁ with as much conviction as i could , i whispered , ` ` i finally understand . \\n▁ it hurts so much . \\n▁ life … it hurts so much . \\n▁ i do n't feel like i belong in it . \\n▁ ever since the crash , i have n't felt like i should be here and now i know why . '' \\n▁ i pulled back to look at her , the pain in her eyes making me ache , but not changing my resolve . \\n▁ no matter what , i had to right this wrong . \\n▁ i had to set life back on its correct course . \\n▁ ` ` luc … i do n't understand . \\n▁ you 're just where you 're supposed to be … '' a sob escaped her and i clutched her close to me , shifting us , so she was facing the car and i was free from it . \\n▁ her hands went up to my cheeks as our heads stayed pressed against each other . \\n▁ i closed my eyes . \\n▁ i would miss her , so much , but she was better off with someone else anyway , someone completely a part of this world . \\n▁ ` ` no , sawyer . \\n▁ life , god , fate … i do n't know , but someone made a mistake , and i was never supposed to have survived that crash . \\n▁ that 's why my dreams feel so real , that 's why i ' m so drawn to them . \\n▁ i ' m supposed to be with them , with lillian . '' \\n▁ rain started falling then , and not the soft , gentle rain of a spring storm . \\n▁ no , the heavy , hard rain of a winter onslaught . \\n▁ the drops around us were huge and plentiful , and within seconds , the tops of our shirts were drenched . \\n▁ i inwardly smiled at how similar this rain was to that fateful night . \\n▁ it was like the universe understood my intent , and was helping me to fix its mistake . \\n▁ even more peace and self assurance went through me . \\n▁ this was right … this was meant to be . \\n▁ she tilted her head and eyed me cautiously , the rain dripping down her face , only highlighting those wide , worried , slightly almond eyes . \\n▁ ` ` what are you saying , lucas ? '' \\n▁ one of her hands dropped from my cheek and trailed down my arm , the arm with the hand currently death - gripping the car key . \\n▁ knowing my time was almost up , and knowing sawyer was about to make her move to stop me , i leaned forward and brought my lips to hers , giving her the one last thing i could , even though she deserved so much better . \\n▁ her hand came back up to my face as our mouths moved together . \\n▁ she held me close and a sob escaped her . \\n▁ i tasted tears along with the natural sweet taste of her , as the rain mixed the two liquids and washed over our bodies . \\n▁ i knew she could feel the goodbye in my kiss , i felt it too . \\n▁ i knew this would be it for us , and i prayed that the next few months for her were n't too painful . \\n▁ i never wanted to hurt her … and that 's all i ever seemed to do . \\n▁ yet another reason she was better off without me . \\n▁ mentally steeling myself , i did something i was n't proud of , but it needed to be done … for her sake . \\n▁ she needed to let me go . \\n▁ she needed a better life , with a better man . \\n▁ that thought echoing in my head , i brought my hands up to her shoulders and shoved her back , hard . \\n▁ shock was on her face as she hit the side of her car , missing the hood and falling heavily to the hard ground . \\n▁ i did n't stay to make sure she was okay , i did n't have time . \\n▁ i dashed around to the driver 's side door and once inside , immediately locked it and then stretched over to the passenger 's side , locking it as well . \\n▁ as i sat up , sawyer was standing at the driver 's door , tears streaming along with the rain . \\n▁ she clutched at the door handle frantically , screaming my name . \\n▁ i put my hand on the glass and stared at her remorsefully . \\n▁ i regretted ever causing this beautiful woman pain and i hoped she knew that . \\n▁ i hoped she knew how i felt about her , that she knew she was the only thing that had brightened my life over the past few months , and that i did indeed love her . \\n▁ i still had to do this though … she put her hand on the glass , flexing her fingers like she was trying to lace our hands together through the cold , wet barrier . \\n▁ i removed my hand and , out of habit , buckled my seatbelt . \\n▁ i paused with the key just touching the ignition , a brief moment of fear , mixed with determination and anticipation , coursing through me . \\n▁ it settled into peace almost instantly . \\n▁ this was right … i had no reason to fear it . \\n▁ her eyes widened as she watched my fingers insert the keys and then she started pounding on the glass , maybe trying to break through the door . \\n▁ ` ` what are you gon na do , luc ? '' \\n▁ she yelled at me , her face frantic . \\n▁ i stared at her terrified eyes for a brief moment before answering her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m only fixing a mistake . '' \\n▁ i turned the keys and started the car , never taking my eyes from sawyer . \\n▁ her hands pounded ruthlessly on the glass as the engine roared to life ; i was sure she 'd have bruises tomorrow . \\n▁ ` ` what are you gon na do ? '' \\n▁ she yelled again , the tears welling in her eyes almost indistinguishable from the heavy drops falling around her . \\n▁ a moment of grief welled in me , she was the only one i 'd truly miss , the only one that had never let me down . \\n▁ no , all of the letting down in our relationship had come from me . \\n▁ ` i ' m sorry ' , i mouthed to her . \\n▁ she shook her head , muttering , ` ` no , please … do n't . '' \\n▁ from the corner of my eye , i saw the front door of my house open and knew my mom was soon to be flying down the stairs and throwing herself on top of the car if need be . \\n▁ i did n't want that . \\n▁ i slammed the car into reverse , peeling out of the wet driveway in my haste . \\n▁ my mom ran to the spot i 'd just been , screaming at me . \\n▁ sawyer covered her mouth with her hands , shaking her head in horror . \\n▁ and then i took off , leaving them both in the driveway , in a downpour , looking terrified and distraught . \\n▁ i felt bad for the fear they had , and for the pain i knew they 'd both go through once i 'd finished this , but i had to finish it . \\n▁ i was never supposed to have survived that crash . \\n▁ that 's why life had been so hard and my dreams had felt more real to me . \\n▁ i was n't supposed to be here . \\n▁ one day , i was sure they 'd both see that . \\n▁ i drove more steadily than i 'd ever believed i could . \\n▁ the rain sheeted down my windshield as i flew out of the city limits , out onto that fateful highway . \\n▁ the onslaught brought on memories of that night . \\n▁ they tumbled through my brain , one after another , each one only solidifying my decision - i was never supposed to have survived . \\n▁ i saw that now . \\n▁ the tiny disco ball on sawyer 's rearview mirror gently swung back and forth , like it was agreeing with my conclusion . \\n▁ i was n't sure if i 'd be able to find the same exact spot in the road where i 'd gone over the rail , it had been dark and pouring that night , but then , like a flaming neon sign , the bend came into focus . \\n▁ it seemed to glow to me . \\n▁ faint , black lines on the asphalt from darren 's geo were suddenly huge landing lights , showing me exactly where i needed to go over the edge , the exact point of contact , highlighted by a makeshift memorial that some of the kids at school must have created . \\n▁ it was supposed to be honorary , for the lives lost , but it was about to be a bull 's - eye for another life , that needed to be lost . \\n▁ as i drove past the bend , i could see that the weakened guard rail that i 'd busted through the first time had been replaced . \\n▁ it looked strong and sturdy now . \\n▁ but i was no longer in a cheap , styrofoam beginner 's car . \\n▁ i was in a revved up muscle car and given enough speed , i 'd slice through that metal like butter . \\n▁ and this time , my goal was speed . \\n▁ this time , brakes were the last thing on my mind . \\n▁ i turned the car around so i could approach the bend from the same direction i had that night . \\n▁ i wanted everything to be the same , i wanted to perfectly recreate that moment - set the timeline straight . \\n▁ if i could have , i 'd of stayed out here until nightfall , so it would be just as dark as the first time . \\n▁ i did n't have that kind of time though . \\n▁ either my mom , sawyer or the sheriff would find me before then . \\n▁ i would just have to settle for the hazy , gray overcast light of this rainy morning . \\n▁ oh well , it helped me see exactly where i needed to go anyway . \\n▁ i stopped the car a half mile from the bend and stared at it . \\n▁ my demon . \\n▁ it was like staring down at the darkest part of myself . \\n▁ this is where my life had turned one eighty . \\n▁ this is where my life had ended . \\n▁ this is where my life would end . \\n▁ i unbuckled my seat belt . \\n▁ this time … it would end . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i sighed and hoped my mom would n't have to hear too much about it , that people would be kind to her over her loss . \\n▁ maybe she and the sheriff could move away once his wife passed on from her illness . \\n▁ they could heal each other . \\n▁ i smiled wider as i pictured the great life they could have together . \\n▁ as the haunting , but beautiful , lyrics drifted through my brain , i turned my attention back to the guard rail . \\n▁ i blinked , startled , when i noticed a car there that had n't been there before . \\n▁ a car that i knew very well . \\n▁ a car that was currently blocking the predetermined path of my demise . \\n▁ i blinked again , not understanding what my mother 's station wagon was doing parked in front of my bulls - eye . \\n▁ how had she found me so fast ? \\n▁ then the station wagon door opened and a figure stepped out into the rain . \\n▁ i immediately understood how i 'd been found , as i watched sawyer shut the door , her clothes and hair drenched from the downpour . \\n▁ sawyer and i nearly had the same mind at times , and if anyone could guess correctly where i 'd go to end my life , it 'd be her . \\n▁ i should have realized that earlier and not spent so much precious time ruminating . \\n▁ i should have pieced it together that that safe and sound club had probably been out here , on more than one occasion , to maintain the shrine that was sort of their reason for being . \\n▁ even though sawyer and i had never talked about this spot , of course she 'd know exactly where it was . \\n▁ she stood in front of the car door defiantly , arms over her chest , and i clearly understood the message , even from this distance - ` you want this , you 'll have to go through me to get it . ' \\n▁ i revved the engine , hoping she would move . \\n▁ she did n't , she did n't even flinch . \\n▁ i did it again , letting the car surge forward a few feet . \\n▁ nothing . \\n▁ she did n't even react . \\n▁ well , maybe she did lift her chin higher . \\n▁ she was n't going to budge on this . \\n▁ i cursed and slammed my hand on the wheel . \\n▁ she was ruining everything ! \\n▁ she 'd never let me down before , why was she doing it now ? \\n▁ i glanced at her corsage still hanging from the rearview mirror . \\n▁ where before , i 'd seen the broken petals as symbolic of our horrid night at the dance , now they seemed to mock my desperation . \\n▁ gritting my jaw , committing myself to the action , i revved the car and slammed on the gas . \\n▁ i hated to take her with me , but i had to do this , i could n't stop myself . \\n▁ the car propelled forward , the rain smacking the windshield forcefully . \\n▁ she still did n't move . \\n▁ i was going to plow right into her . \\n▁ i imagined the car slicing her in two and tears stung my eyes . \\n▁ i imagined the life leaving her body and i felt a sob rise . \\n▁ the haunting lyrics of living through the pain played on through the car 's speakers , searing me . \\n▁ the pleasing scent of lemons always present in sawyer 's car , choked me . \\n▁ i loved her … i could n't kill her . \\n▁ i knew to not slam on the brakes in this downpour , so i gently eased them down , the car slowly responding . \\n▁ i was still going too fast to stop in time from hitting her though , so i turned the wheel , heading for the edge of the road . \\n▁ the car hit the gravel and i jerked the brakes down , spinning a bit on the loose rocks , but stopping without sliding . \\n▁ my heart racing at what i 'd nearly committed to doing , i cursed loudly and slammed my hand against the wheel repeatedly again . \\n▁ i looked out the window at sawyer on the other side of the street , still standing in front of my mother 's car , watching me . \\n▁ her eyes were wide and she was ghastly pale , shaking near uncontrollably . \\n▁ she 'd thought i was n't going to stop . \\n▁ and she still had n't been going to move . \\n▁ if i was going … she was going . \\n▁ i jerked open my door , angry that she 'd throw her life away for me , and slammed it shut behind me . \\n▁ she straightened at my approach , dropping her hands to her sides , fists clenched for a fight . \\n▁ i shook my head as i walked right up to her , the rain drenching me , running down my face . \\n▁ ` ` what the hell do you think you 're doing ! '' \\n▁ her eyes narrowed as she glared at me , the gray depths matching the stormy clouds above . \\n▁ ` ` what am i doing ? '' \\n▁ she thrust a finger into my chest . \\n▁ ` ` what the hell are you doing ? '' \\n▁ i irritably batted her finger away , frustration rising in me . \\n▁ i needed to do this . \\n▁ i needed to do it now … while i could . \\n▁ ` ` get out of the way , sawyer ! '' \\n▁ she crossed her hands over her chest again , thrusting her chin out at me . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ this is insane , lucas ! \\n▁ i ' m not just going to let you do this ! '' \\n▁ i threw my hands into my wet hair , feeling like i wanted to yank it out of my scalp in my irritation . \\n▁ she was messing up everything ! \\n▁ and i 'd been so close . \\n▁ ` ` a xxrep 3 h ! \\n▁ it 's already done ! '' \\n▁ i jerked my hand over to the railing , indicating the ravine where my dead body should already be lying . \\n▁ ` ` this is what was supposed to happen . \\n▁ i ' m just fixing an error ! '' \\n▁ she shoved her hands into my chest , knocking me back a step . \\n▁ her face got right into mine , fiery and frightened . \\n▁ ` ` fixing an error ? \\n▁ you lived for a reason , lucas ! '' \\n▁ i threw my hands out to the sides , water droplets flying from my hands and smashing into the droplets falling from the sky . \\n▁ the violence in the air around me only added to my conviction - today was a day for destruction . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ there is no reason ! '' \\n▁ none to stay alive , that is , i had plenty of reasons to stop . \\n▁ sawyer , her face paler than i 'd ever seen , stepped forward and grabbed my cheeks . \\n▁ fear outweighed the fury in her voice as she spoke over the pounding rain . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't the way . '' \\n▁ i shook my head in her hands , my own anger ebbing . \\n▁ ` ` it has to be . \\n▁ i ca n't move forward , i ca n't go back … this is it for me . '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked over to the ravine again , hoping she 'd understand , hoping i understood . \\n▁ she shifted my head back to her , when i started to stare longingly at the point of impact i so wished to meet up with . \\n▁ ` ` no ! \\n▁ you have to stay here . \\n▁ it will get better . '' \\n▁ her eyes searched mine frantically as she swallowed and worried her lip , marked with beads of water . \\n▁ ` ` please , believe me . '' \\n▁ i shrugged and shook my head again , pulling her hands from my face . \\n▁ they seemed so small and fragile at the moment , and i wished she had n't come out to witness this . \\n▁ it 'd be better for her if she 'd found out after the fact . \\n▁ ` ` i remember everything , sawyer , and it 's killing me . \\n▁ i wish i could forget ! \\n▁ i 'd do anything to forget . \\n▁ i remember the rain , i remember losing control . \\n▁ i remember slamming into that guard rail and going right through it . \\n▁ i remember everyone screaming and then i remember … silence … and blood . \\n▁ so much blood . \\n▁ how do i forget that ? \\n▁ how do i possibly forget that ? \\n▁ how do i move on ? '' \\n▁ i took a step back from her , staring at the guard rail again . \\n▁ ` ` how does any of that get better ? '' \\n▁ she let out a soft sob and i turned my eyes back to her . \\n▁ i so wished she had n't come . \\n▁ ` ` please , luc ! \\n▁ i do n't know how , but you have to find a way ! '' \\n▁ i put my hands up to my chest . \\n▁ ` ` but that 's just it - i do n't want to anymore . \\n▁ i do n't want to go on . \\n▁ i ' m done ! '' \\n▁ she threw herself at my body , her hands wrapping around my waist , her wet hair sticking to my arms , like tethers , trying to bind me to this world . \\n▁ ` ` no , you have to stay . \\n▁ i demand you stay ! '' \\n▁ i could n't help but to note the similarities between her words and the words i 'd spouted at lillian . \\n▁ it would n't work for her , anymore than it had worked for me though . \\n▁ it was too late . \\n▁ i tried to push her off of me , but she clawed and pulled in a ferocious attempt to stay attached to my body . \\n▁ we struggled with each other , until both of us were panting from the exertion , the rain never stopping its relentless soaking . \\n▁ eventually , i managed to firmly grab onto both of her wrists and hold them in front of me . \\n▁ her eyes begged me as surely as her voice . \\n▁ ` ` please , you have to deal with the pain - we all do ! '' \\n▁ exhausted and frustrated at the physical and emotional battle i had n't been prepared for , i snapped back , ` ` what the hell do you know about pain , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ her eyes hardened and she gave me a glare that would have sent any other boy heading for cover . \\n▁ i matched her look though , not backing down from this fight , not when what i wanted was so close to me , just a few yards over her shoulder . \\n▁ without a word , she twisted her wrists in my grasp and shoved her arms forward . \\n▁ her clothes and skin were so wet that the fabric of her long sleeves bunched up around my fingers , the material sliding up her arms to her elbows . \\n▁ i looked down , confused … and then i stopped and stared , my mouth wide open . \\n▁ ` ` i may not understand exactly what you feel , lucas , but i understand pain ! '' \\n▁ i could n't answer her ; i was still staring at her arms . \\n▁ when she 'd twisted them in my grasp , she 'd turned her palms up to me . \\n▁ when she 'd shoved her arms forward , my grasp on her shirt had exposed her inner arms . \\n▁ and for the first time , i completely understood why sawyer always dressed in long - sleeved clothes . \\n▁ i remembered back to her habit of unconsciously playing with her long sleeves , and thought that maybe that was n't an unconscious habit after all … maybe that was a reminder . \\n▁ a reminder , of the thick , three inch long scars running vertically down each wrist . \\n▁ i relaxed my hold on her and ran a thumb down each telltale mark . \\n▁ her arms visibly pulled away , but i had enough of a grasp on her , to not let her keep hiding herself from me anymore . \\n▁ i thought back to her panicked look when ms . reynolds had been holding her wrist , and thought that this was something she probably hid from everyone . \\n▁ my own pain momentarily forgotten , i looked back up to her tear and rain streaked face . \\n▁ ` ` what did you do , sawyer ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ she shook her head remorsefully . \\n▁ ` ` something so stupid … i can hardly believe it sometimes . '' \\n▁ we both relaxed our positions until i was holding her fingers , lacing them with mine . \\n▁ ` ` after that jerk of a guy used me … i could n't deal . \\n▁ one night , sitting home alone , i just decided enough was enough … my life would never get better . \\n▁ i 'd never love like that again and nothing but pain awaited me . '' \\n▁ she shrugged as her eyes flicked between mine . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't want to live another day in that agony , and i could n't see a way out of it . \\n▁ i busted into my dad 's liquor cabinet , busted into my mom 's medicine cabinet , and started chasing sleeping pills with whiskey shots . '' \\n▁ her eyes lost focus and looked through me , back into her past . \\n▁ i gripped her fingers tight as she continued with her nightmare . \\n▁ ` ` when that did n't work fast enough for me … i found a box knife in the garage . \\n▁ i sat on the floor and sliced each arm . '' \\n▁ her gaze returned to mine . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't even think about it … i did n't even feel it . '' \\n▁ her lip twisted wryly . \\n▁ ` ` i gave myself a trio of death … one of which was sure to claim me . '' \\n▁ she blinked and shook her head , her voice starting to waver . \\n▁ ` ` my parents came home , sometime after i passed out , and found me … bleeding all over their garage . '' \\n▁ she sniffed and heavy tears ran down her already wet cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` they barely got there in time . \\n▁ a few more minutes … '' she sighed and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` that 's why they do n't give me much leeway now , why they moved us to the middle of nowhere . \\n▁ they 're scared i 'll try that again . '' \\n▁ she dropped one of my hands and brushed the tears and rain off my cheek , mixing them into my skin as she softly stroked me while she continued . \\n▁ ` ` but i 'd never , ever try that again . \\n▁ because i see now … that things do get better . '' \\n▁ she stepped closer to me so that our bodies were touching . \\n▁ i vaguely noticed that the rain was letting up considerably , only a few droplets splashing on her cheeks and black hair as she lovingly gazed up at me . \\n▁ ` ` i see that , because of you , lucas … because i fell in love with you . '' \\n▁ she leaned up and brushed her lips against mine . \\n▁ i felt the crushing grief enter me as her lips touched mine . \\n▁ grief that maybe i could n't go through with this … grief that maybe i 'd have to endure this nonstop pain even longer . \\n▁ i could n't . \\n▁ i could n't imagine another day feeling this way . \\n▁ a sob escaped me as our mouths moved together . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't … i ca n't … '' i mumbled between our kiss . \\n▁ her hands came up to my cheeks , her scars still visible to me in my watery peripheral . \\n▁ ` ` you can … i 'll help you . \\n▁ i love you . '' \\n▁ i saw a patch of stale sunlight illuminate the top of my mom 's car behind her and knew the storm was passing , moving on to another location . \\n▁ panic seized me ; it felt like my window of opportunity was closing . \\n▁ like , if i did n't do this now , while the conditions were similar to that night , then i 'd never be able to do it … i shook my head and stepped back from her . \\n▁ the rain around me was shifting to a gentle shower . \\n▁ i was running out of time . \\n▁ my breath started coming in sharp pulls - i had to do this . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry … i ' m not as strong as you , sawyer . '' \\n▁ i backed away farther and her hand snaked out to grab the wet dress shirt clinging to my shaking body . \\n▁ she grabbed the top and pulled , trying to keep me near her , her eyes wide . \\n▁ ` ` you are ! \\n▁ you 're stronger than you think . '' \\n▁ she shook her head , her hair sticking to her neck . \\n▁ a patch of brighter sunlight hit her and for a moment , she truly did look like the angel she was . \\n▁ i 'd miss her so much . \\n▁ ` ` you 're wonderful , lucas . '' \\n▁ her other hand came up to clutch at my shirt , pulling me into her . \\n▁ ` ` you 're warm and funny and loving . \\n▁ you belong here … with me . '' \\n▁ my voice came out in a sob as i tried to remove her fingers from my clothes . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not supposed to be here … '' i successfully removed her hands and clenched them in mine , wanting her to understand that i needed to do this and i needed to do it alone . \\n▁ ` ` please … leave , sawyer . \\n▁ you should n't have to see this . '' \\n▁ dropping her hands , i turned to sprint back to the camaro . \\n▁ i 'd find another way around her if she was n't going to move . \\n▁ the rain was stopping , i needed to hurry . \\n▁ but sawyer was n't about to let me go without a fight . \\n▁ as i turned , she flung her arms around my waist , physically restraining me with everything inside her small body . \\n▁ i twisted in her arms , struggling to break free . \\n▁ ` ` stop , sawyer , let me go ! '' \\n▁ she sobbed into my back , her voice nearly muffled from our struggle . \\n▁ ` ` no , i 'll never let go , luc ! '' \\n▁ we struggled together , but i was stronger than her . \\n▁ i eventually pulled us both into the middle of the highway . \\n▁ i started to panic as we became more exposed to the open road . \\n▁ it would serve my purpose if a car flew around the corner and struck me , but i did n't want to see sawyer get hurt . \\n▁ panic gave me the extra edge i needed to break away from sawyer 's adrenaline - filled grasp . \\n▁ i finally extracted myself and gave her a shove , merely intending to stall her , to give me the time i needed to get back to the car . \\n▁ as i made a run for it , my head turned to watch her as she landed harshly on the ground . \\n▁ her hands behind her broke her fall , but it still looked like it had hurt and for a second , i debated turning around to help her . \\n▁ but i felt sunlight on my face and not raindrops , and i twisted back around to her still running car . \\n▁ i did n't have time to help her . \\n▁ as i opened the door , i heard from behind me , ` ` do n't you love me ? '' \\n▁ she had yelled that and the sound of her question echoed throughout my entire body . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and inhaled deep . \\n▁ turning , i opened them to see her standing in the middle of the road , her arms outstretched to her sides . \\n▁ her face held more fear , anger and love than i 'd ever seen on someone . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i said , simply . \\n▁ her hands clenched into fists as she stared across the road at me . \\n▁ i flicked quick glances up and down the street , praying that she 'd move before she got hurt . \\n▁ seemingly in synch again , her words sort of echoed my thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` you said you 'd never hurt me . '' \\n▁ she pointed over to the embankment i was so aching to go over . \\n▁ ` ` this will hurt me , lucas ! '' \\n▁ i slumped as i watched her . \\n▁ this would be my only regret , and she knew that . \\n▁ she was digging her finger in the one wound that made this an almost difficult decision for me . \\n▁ i would miss her and i had no desire to hurt her . \\n▁ i could n't see a way around that though … and it was too late to stop . \\n▁ ` ` please … forgive me , '' i begged . \\n▁ she stalked over to where i was standing in the open door . \\n▁ a part of me relaxed that she was now safe , a part of me worried that since she 'd succeeded in making me pause , she 'd now succeed in making me stop , and then i 'd fail . \\n▁ i did n't want to fail . \\n▁ i could n't live like this anymore … i did n't want to . \\n▁ she stepped right up to me , pressing her wet , shivering body into mine . \\n▁ ` ` no , i do n't forgive you . \\n▁ i 'll never forgive you for this . '' \\n▁ my face fell as she confirmed that my biggest regret , was a warranted one . \\n▁ ` ` but … but you understand . '' \\n▁ my hand reached down to her wrist , lifting it . \\n▁ she understood the reference and shook her head , lifting her other wrist level with the first . \\n▁ ` ` these were mistakes that i somehow managed to live through . '' \\n▁ she shook her head again and then grabbed my face . \\n▁ ` ` do n't make my mistake . '' \\n▁ confusion flooded through me , as the sound of dripping water filled my ears ; water dripping from leaves and branches , not the sky . \\n▁ the storm had stopped . \\n▁ the sound was reminiscent of that night , of the water dripping in the car . \\n▁ i shivered , and not from the cold . \\n▁ ` ` mistake ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , not understanding the simple word . \\n▁ the only mistake i saw was my life being allowed to continue . \\n▁ i was supposed to die . \\n▁ it was fated , and you do n't mess with fate . \\n▁ my eyes had drifted to the ravine and she brought my attention back to her . \\n▁ ` ` yes , luc … mistake . \\n▁ you were meant to live . \\n▁ you were saved . '' \\n▁ she shook her head lightly , her face soft with compassion . \\n▁ ` ` you were spared … just like me . '' \\n▁ i was shaking my head , fresh tears falling , but she continued before i could object . \\n▁ ` ` would you rather i was dead , lucas ? \\n▁ that i had n't survived ? '' \\n▁ i violently shook my head and drew her into me . \\n▁ no , i could n't imagine that fate . \\n▁ she exhaled brokenly into my soaked shoulder , her arms going around my neck . \\n▁ ` ` that 's the same way i feel about you . '' \\n▁ her hand twisted into my slick hair and she pulled back to gaze at me intently . \\n▁ ` ` you 're my miracle . \\n▁ do n't take that from me . '' \\n▁ i felt something crack in me and wanted to object , but words failed me . \\n▁ it felt like the window had fully closed , snapped shut , never to be reopened . \\n▁ i 'd missed my chance . \\n▁ despair crept into those cracks and a soft sob escaped me . \\n▁ sawyer lovingly stroked my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , lucas . \\n▁ heart and soul , i love you . \\n▁ i ca n't imagine a world without you in it . \\n▁ please … stay . '' \\n▁ i still could n't answer , sobs were stealing my words . \\n▁ the grief i felt within me , welled to such a painful point that i thought i might break apart . \\n▁ i 'd never see lil again . \\n▁ i 'd never see any of them again . \\n▁ as my determination failed me , i started to feel the icy cold that i 'd been standing in for awhile . \\n▁ my body started to shake in earnest as the wet clothes stuck to my wet skin , creating a coldness on the outside that matched the coldness of my hollowed out inside . \\n▁ sawyer stroked my shaking arms , ignoring how her own wet body was shaking just as badly . \\n▁ ` ` stay here , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` stay here with me . \\n▁ we 'll figure it out together . '' \\n▁ the coldness and loneliness overwhelmed me , finally broke me . \\n▁ i sank into the seat and lay over my knees , sobbing . \\n▁ she knelt down with me , her hands caressing my back . \\n▁ she murmured words of love and encouragement while my pain came out in soft wails . \\n▁ when i could breathe through the torture , i mumbled into my knees . \\n▁ ` ` they 're gone … they 're all gone . '' \\n▁ she murmured in my ear in response . \\n▁ ` ` i know , luc . \\n▁ but i ' m not gone . \\n▁ i ' m right here … and i ' m not going anywhere . \\n▁ neither me nor your mom are going to leave you . '' \\n▁ as she spoke , i felt her reach over me and shut off the car . \\n▁ my sobbing increased . \\n▁ it was an empty promise ; no one can say they are never going to leave , not with life as unpredictable as it could be ; i understood that better than most . \\n▁ but the words gave me the faintest glimmer of something anyway . \\n▁ something that nearly felt like everything was going to be okay , and i struggled to hold onto it , to absorb it into me so it could outweigh the crushing sadness . \\n▁ but it was a slippery emotion , and i failed to grasp it time and again , as i bent over and continued my sobbing . \\n▁ i heard words escape through my tears , although i had no control over saying them . \\n▁ ` ` they abandoned me … lil abandoned me … '' i heard myself repeating it over and over in a nearly maniacal way , and sawyer continued her soothing tone and soothing movements , repeatedly saying , ` ` they did n't , luc … they died . \\n▁ no one left you … they were taken from you . \\n▁ there 's a difference … '' ` ` oh god , sawyer … they 're really gone … '' the crying started in earnest at that point . \\n▁ i do n't know how long she comforted my crying body , but eventually in the distance i heard a siren approaching . \\n▁ i did n't look up from my lap as the siren got louder and louder . \\n▁ i mumbled more words , some coherent , some not , and sawyer gave me comforting responses in return , always assuring me that she was here , that she was n't leaving . \\n▁ her hands rubbed warm patches into my back as my head rested on my knees . \\n▁ the siren stopped and i heard a door open in the distance , but it sounded foggy , like i was hearing it through a tunnel . \\n▁ i thought maybe i was going to pass out from the strain , but somehow consciousness stayed with me . \\n▁ and then , through that haze , i heard a voice calling my name in a panic . \\n▁ i lifted my head , confused as to who was calling for me . \\n▁ i ruefully noticed the blue patches of cloudless sky above me , marred by only a few gray swatches of stormy clouds now , and those not looking like there was a drop of rain left in them . \\n▁ i 'd failed . \\n▁ some tiny , tiny part of my brain felt relief in that as sawyer held me . \\n▁ the xxunk of my name became apparent to me as sawyer 's body was moved aside , and none too gently , to make room for my mom . \\n▁ sawyer stepped back , her stormy eyes never leaving my face , as my mom squatted in front of me . \\n▁ she threw her arms around me and squeezed so tight i could n't fully inhale . \\n▁ i let her . \\n▁ guilt filled me as she began to sob . \\n▁ the guilt increased tenfold when she started to sob apologies . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry , luc . \\n▁ i ' m so sorry i lied . '' \\n▁ a figure stepped behind her , placing a hand on her shoulder . \\n▁ i looked up from my mom to the sheriff standing by sawyer in the open car door . \\n▁ his face was solemn , his steel eyes watery . \\n▁ he blinked a few times and lightly shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry too , luc . \\n▁ we should have told you . '' \\n▁ i dropped my head and shut my eyes . \\n▁ i had n't wanted to see their pain . \\n▁ it was so much easier to imagine them years after the fact , when they were already over me . \\n▁ but my absence would have been just as painful for them as my friend 's absence was for me . \\n▁ maybe worse , since they 'd have the added guilt of feeling like they 'd pushed me over the edge … which they had n't , not specifically anyway . \\n▁ it was multiple small events that had made this overly large reaction seem the only way out . \\n▁ as i shifted my focus between my mom , the sheriff and sawyer , clarity filled me again , a less dramatic clarity than before , but no less profound . \\n▁ i did n't want to hurt the people who loved me . \\n▁ i did n't want them to feel the pain i felt . \\n▁ i did n't want them to feel responsible for my death , the way i felt responsible for my friends ' . \\n▁ i did n't want … to die . \\n▁ i slung my arms around my mom and held her to me . \\n▁ while she sobbed in my arms , my eyes locked with sawyer 's behind her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , '' i said softly , speaking to both of them . \\n▁ they both nodded , my mom on the verge of an emotional breakdown in my arms . \\n▁ finally sheriff whitney pulled her back . \\n▁ she turned in his arms and embraced him in a way i 'd never seen her embrace anyone . \\n▁ i stared at them a moment , at the obvious love between them and thought maybe my mom was right . \\n▁ maybe i was too young to understand their situation . \\n▁ i inhaled deeply , releasing it slowly . \\n▁ i may be too young to fully understand it , but i was n't too young to condemn it solely on principle . \\n▁ who was i to judge where two people found love ? \\n▁ a sob rose in me , as my thoughts drifted back to my love … lillian . \\n▁ sawyer resumed her squatting position in front of me , her hands rubbing my wet , shaking legs . \\n▁ she looked over my face with concerned eyes . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ the sob broke free as a wave of guilt and grief washed over me . \\n▁ i may have been able to halt the desire to end my life , and even that was still sort of tittering back and forth , but the desire to live was n't exactly bringing me xxunk feelings . \\n▁ no , i was n't being overwhelmed by some sudden need to seize the day and make the most of each moment . \\n▁ i was still crushed - devastated and still feeling alone . \\n▁ i still hated myself … and what i 'd done . \\n▁ ` ` i killed them , sawyer … all of them . '' \\n▁ tears fell from my eyes and she cupped my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` no … it was an accident , luc . \\n▁ let it go , baby . '' \\n▁ she flushed a bit after she said that , and i smiled for a micro - second before grief swept over me , crushing me . \\n▁ i knew if i was going to survive this day … i 'd need help . \\n▁ i scooted forward a bit and reached into my back pocket . \\n▁ finding my wallet , i pulled it out and gave it to my mom . \\n▁ she took it with an eager expression , eager to help me in any way possible . \\n▁ she raised an eyebrow and in - between tears i told her to call beth . \\n▁ she looked at sawyer , confused , and sawyer , her mind in line with mine again , thankfully explained for me . \\n▁ ` ` his counselor … mrs . ryans . \\n▁ her card must be in there somewhere . '' \\n▁ my mom nodded and immediately pulled out her cell phone while sheriff watched the road , ever cognizant of the potential danger of so many cars pulled alongside the highway , right at a sharp corner . \\n▁ i heard my mom 's animated voice , talking rapidly and emotionally to someone on the other end of the phone . \\n▁ i tuned it out and focused on sawyer , focused on my peace . \\n▁ i tried to make the comfort i used to get from her return to me . \\n▁ it was harder to do now ; i had much more painful memories attached to her than before . \\n▁ but watching those pale eyes stare back at me unblinkingly , watching the beautiful shape of her lips , the arch of her brow , the spot where i knew my hidden dimple lay buried , eventually , i found a small level of comfort . \\n▁ knowing that that was probably all i 'd get today , i soaked it in . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i whispered , my voice so hoarse it was nearly comical . \\n▁ she did n't laugh though . \\n▁ instead , tears leaked from her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome … do n't ever try that again . '' \\n▁ a small smile crept into my lips and i nodded . \\n▁ exhaustion overtook me and i lowered my head to hers . \\n▁ she ran her fingers back through my hair in a soothing , repetitious pattern , and we waited . \\n▁ waited for me to feel well enough to live . \\n▁ a numbness settled into me and i was vaguely aware of voices talking about me in the background . \\n▁ i stared without really seeing , my head a blank slate for once . \\n▁ i became aware of being removed from the car and shifted into the passenger 's seat , although i had no idea who 'd actually moved me over . \\n▁ then the car restarted and i was leaving this cursed place . \\n▁ i was going home . \\n▁ a hand came over to grasp mine and i clenched it , not knowing whose is was . \\n▁ a soft , comforting voice filled the car and i only caught the soothing , feminine tone , not the actual words . \\n▁ within moments , we were pulling back into my driveway , where a strange car was already waiting for us , parked along the street . \\n▁ my mom 's wagon pulled up next to us and i looked over , registering her haggard face staring at me through the window . \\n▁ she stepped out of her car and opened my door , helping me out . \\n▁ i looked at her blankly as she grabbed my hand and helped me stand . \\n▁ she was drier than me , but looked just as worn , her eyes red and her face sickly pale . \\n▁ the sheriff came up to help her , having driven himself to our house , and the two of them clumsily got me inside . \\n▁ they walked me to the couch and sat me on it . \\n▁ i sort of felt like a rag - doll , an empty shell that people could move around and dress up to look human , but i was n't really sure if that 's what i was anymore . \\n▁ i heard sawyer 's voice enter the house and i instinctually turned to look for her . \\n▁ she was walking through the door with mrs . ryans … beth . \\n▁ she was animatedly telling her something , beth nodding and eyeing me with a furrowed brow . \\n▁ in my numb haze , i could n't make out the words , but i could picture them well enough . \\n▁ sawyer was replaying the events that had happened on the highway . \\n▁ i did n't care . \\n▁ i did n't care what sawyer said to her . \\n▁ i had no secrets anymore . \\n▁ mom anxiously went up to beth , grabbing her hands and making a pleading noise . \\n▁ i could n't tell what she was saying either , but i figured she was begging the professional to save her damaged son . \\n▁ if i could have felt any emotions at the moment , i 'd probably feel really guilty about that . \\n▁ beth nodded and tried to remove her hands from mom 's grasp , but mom was holding her tight , like she was her lifeline or something . \\n▁ eventually the sheriff had to walk over and remove her , pulling her into the kitchen . \\n▁ sawyer eyed me on the couch and looked torn as to whether or not she should join me . \\n▁ i watched her curiously , not knowing what i wanted , since i was n't letting anything fully enter my consciousness . \\n▁ beth brought a hand to her shoulder and told her something . \\n▁ sawyer nodded at her and then turned to wait in the kitchen , giving me one final supportive glance before she left . \\n▁ beth came over and sat in a chair next to the couch . \\n▁ she did n't say anything , just smiled at me . \\n▁ i stupidly smiled back , just like that doll again , mimicking life , but not really meaning it . \\n▁ she inhaled a big breath and let it out slowly . \\n▁ i did the same . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … '' she said softly . \\n▁ i nodded and waited . \\n▁ ` ` how are you ? '' \\n▁ i looked down , numbness still the overriding feeling in my body . \\n▁ knowing nothing would hurt me right now , i looked back up at her and spoke more honestly than i usually ever did . \\n▁ ` ` i tried to kill myself today . '' \\n▁ she gave me a sympathetic smile and nodded . \\n▁ the pride on her face that i 'd admitted something extremely painful , freely , was evident . \\n▁ ` ` i know , lucas , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so glad you called for me . '' \\n▁ i exhaled and it felt like the first true exhale i 'd taken in months . \\n▁ i felt pieces of myself xxunk with that exhale . \\n▁ rebooting , like i 'd turned myself off and the computer within me was resetting itself . \\n▁ i hoped whatever bug was in my system cleared itself out with this restart . \\n▁ for the rest of the morning , i talked . \\n▁ beth occasionally asked me questions , but mainly it was just me talking . \\n▁ i told her everything . \\n▁ i held nothing back , no bit of darkness , no edge of insanity , no self hatred - nothing . \\n▁ as my emotions came back to life … it hurt , and i had several panic attacks that beth calmly helped me to breathe through . \\n▁ then i 'd break into crying spells and she 'd rub my arm and tell me to keep going . \\n▁ eventually though , i told her everything i 'd bottled up since the accident . \\n▁ at some point , i lied down on the couch and threw my arm over my eyes . \\n▁ i 'd occasionally hear people talking quietly in the kitchen , or objects moving around , and i knew every person in there could hear what i was saying . \\n▁ i still did n't stop though . \\n▁ i spoke of the party we 'd gone to that night . \\n▁ i spoke of darren and sammy , our friendship and their eternal bond to each other . \\n▁ i spoke of the accident and my horror regarding it . \\n▁ and i spoke of lillian . \\n▁ she was the most painful to talk about , but i did . \\n▁ i spoke of every aspect of our relationship . \\n▁ how intimate we 'd been in life , but how we 'd never taken that last leap into admitting our love out loud , and how we 'd never physically shared that love with each other . \\n▁ i admitted even more intimate details of how we 'd nearly done both of those things in my dreams . \\n▁ i went into an embarrassing amount of detail over how close we 'd gotten to almost consummating our relationship . \\n▁ i ' m sure i blushed a few times , but beth only nodded and encouraged me to continue , and i 'd needed to talk about it with someone … alive . \\n▁ hours later , when my words ran dry , i remained on the couch while beth went to talk to my mom for a moment . \\n▁ i nodded at her , too exhausted to speak anymore , although i did manage a thank you before she left the room . \\n▁ i was exhausted , drained from an overly emotional couple of days . \\n▁ or had it only been one day since the dance ? \\n▁ it felt like years . \\n▁ i felt rubbed raw , inside and outside , but a small smile was on my face as i stared up at the ceiling . \\n▁ i still felt a horrible sadness and an aching pain , that did n't magically go away or anything , but i did feel lighter . \\n▁ and for the first time in a long time , maybe ever since the crash , i felt something stirring in me that almost resembled … hope . \\n▁ sawyer came out and sat on the edge of the couch while the adults talked about me in the kitchen . \\n▁ i grabbed her hand , and xxunk gazed up at her . \\n▁ i could feel the need for sleep filling me and she seemed to see that in me too . \\n▁ she leaned down and brushed some hair off my forehead before she kissed it . \\n▁ her black hair swept over my chest , the familiar , comforting scent of lemons washing over me as she gave me a swift hug . \\n▁ leaning down , she whispered in my ear , ` ` get some sleep , lucas . \\n▁ i love you . '' \\n▁ i felt a love - filled ache building in my chest , and i slung my arms around her , pulling her tight to me . \\n▁ ` ` stay with me , '' i barely squeaked out , my throat raw from talking and tears . \\n▁ she nodded , and brought her legs up onto the couch , her arms wrapping around me , her body quickly following . \\n▁ despite our still slightly damp clothes , she was cocooning me in her warmth and in her love . \\n▁ i closed my eyes , feeling slumber rapidly approaching . \\n▁ before i completely gave into it , i twisted to bury myself even more into her sheltering embrace , my head falling into the crook of her neck . \\n▁ then i kissed the warm skin there and whispered , ` ` i love you too , '' before passing out from exhaustion . \\n▁ i had no dreams that day and was relieved for it . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i cringed whenever i thought about what i 'd almost done , what i would have done if sawyer had n't stopped me . \\n▁ i 'd been so sure . \\n▁ i 'd been absolutely positive that what i 'd been about to do was the correct path for me . \\n▁ i 'd had no real reservations about ending my life , and that knowledge gave me chills . \\n▁ the fact that sawyer knew , and had gone through a decision as equally chilling as mine , bonded us in a way that surpassed the relatively short amount of time we 'd known each other . \\n▁ it was as if our shared tragedies had fast forwarded us into a relationship that felt as if it had been going on our entire lives . \\n▁ she was my best friend . \\n▁ no one understood me like her and no one else probably ever would . \\n▁ and as our talks started ending with passionate kisses , i began to understand that she would be my friend and my lover . \\n▁ she would be my first … i was positive of that . \\n▁ when my healing time of peace with sawyer was over and the new year came around , we went back to school . \\n▁ i was nervous the first day . \\n▁ i 'd left sort of a mess behind from the night of the dance and i had no idea what to expect from people . \\n▁ but sawyer clenched my hand , silently vowing to never leave my side , even when we had to be apart . \\n▁ the first person we saw from that night was randy . \\n▁ he was standing outside of the main building , kicking a clump of grass showing itself through a crack . \\n▁ i let out a long exhale when i saw him , but then straightened myself and made my body approach him . \\n▁ i 'd suffered worse lately , i could handle this . \\n▁ he looked up when he felt us standing in front of him . \\n▁ his eyes widened as they met mine and i fully realized at his surprise that it had been a long time since i 'd willingly looked him squarely in the eye . \\n▁ in fact , it may have been the first time all year that i 'd purposefully held someone 's gaze . \\n▁ he started talking immediately . \\n▁ ` ` hey , luc , i ' m so sorry about … the thing in astronomy … '' his voice trailed off and i made myself not cringe . \\n▁ the ` ` thing '' he referenced so simply , had made me look like an idiot and gotten me kicked out of school temporarily . \\n▁ deciding that none of that mattered , i tightened my hold on sawyer 's hand and let a soft smile reach my lips . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , randy . \\n▁ i understand that you did n't know what you were really doing to me … and i forgive you . '' \\n▁ i clapped a hand on his shoulder and walked away . \\n▁ i exhaled a quick breath as i entered into the main building . \\n▁ looking back , i saw randy eyeing me through the door . \\n▁ he still looked really guilty , but he did have a slight smile on his lips . \\n▁ he nodded at me through the door and i turned my attentions back to sawyer , who was beaming up at me . \\n▁ ` ` you did great . '' \\n▁ she rested her chin on my shoulder as she looked up at me . \\n▁ i smiled and leaned down to her , resting my head against hers . \\n▁ ` ` because of you , '' i whispered . \\n▁ she frowned and shook her head , not seeming to want to take credit for me opening up . \\n▁ i smiled and cut off her objection . \\n▁ ` ` i would n't be here if it were n't for you , so i ' m going to give you all the credit today . '' \\n▁ she sighed and rolled her eyes and i leaned down farther to press my lips to hers . \\n▁ her fingers reached up to brush my cheek as our lips moved softly , but intently together . \\n▁ i could feel the stares of kids in the hall , but i pushed it out . \\n▁ sawyer was mine and for once , i wanted them all to know that . \\n▁ i would n't hold anything back from her again . \\n▁ our make out session was abruptly interrupted by a hand on my shoulder . \\n▁ i broke off from her to look up at coach . \\n▁ i cringed , remembering the last time i 'd seen him . \\n▁ ` ` get to class , lovebirds , '' he gruffly barked at us . \\n▁ sawyer blanched at his tone , but i was used to his rough demeanor . \\n▁ looking down at my feet for a second before deciding to hold his steely gaze , i , as stoically as i could , said , ` ` coach … am i in trouble ? '' \\n▁ i had punched another student after all , and , deserving or not , there had to be some sort of xxunk for that . \\n▁ coach 's lip curled wryly . \\n▁ ` ` for kissing ? \\n▁ no , i think i 'll let that slide . '' \\n▁ he pointed a finger into my chest . \\n▁ ` ` just this once though . '' \\n▁ my brows bunched and i cocked my head at him , while sawyer beside me giggled nervously . \\n▁ ` ` no … for punching josh at the dance , '' i said slowly . \\n▁ coach gave me a pointed look and crossed his arms over my chest . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what you 're talking about , luc . '' \\n▁ i stammered and open and shut my mouth a few times . \\n▁ coach sniffed and glanced up and down the hall . \\n▁ ` ` it 's like i told the principal , the fight was over by the time i got there . '' \\n▁ his eyes flicked back to mine . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't see or hear anything … so how would i know who got punched ? '' \\n▁ a stream of stupid disbelieving noises left my mouth after that . \\n▁ he did n't hear anything ? \\n▁ i was one hundred percent positive that that was n't the case . \\n▁ but then , the coach was fair , if hard . \\n▁ he 'd probably heard josh verbally lead me straight into that fight . \\n▁ who knows , maybe he felt like josh got what he deserved . \\n▁ i kind of did . \\n▁ coach put a hand on my shoulder , his face brightening . \\n▁ ` ` well , we can always talk about this later … when you show up for baseball practice in a few weeks . '' \\n▁ he clapped my shoulder and winked at me . \\n▁ i shook my head as i watched him walk away , one hundred percent positive that i 'd be on the baseball team this spring . \\n▁ as sawyer and i walked up the stairs to class , i made myself pay attention to the people around us . \\n▁ one of the things sawyer and i had talked about at length during break , was my habit of shutting down , of tuning out the world around me . \\n▁ she completely understood the desire , saying she 'd done the same thing at her school , but it was warping my perception of people . \\n▁ i could n't change the past , and i could n't change what certain people believed of me , but as i opened my eyes and looked around , i saw that more people really did look at me with concern and curiosity than outright anger . \\n▁ it was sort of an eye opening experience for me . \\n▁ i made myself give tight smiles and small nods to people i used to know very well . \\n▁ more often than not , i received a smile and nod in return . \\n▁ there were still whispers and gossip swirling as i walked down the hall , but what i noticed now , was that the talking did n't always stop when i walked by , and as i paid more attention , i could see that a lot of the conversations people were having … had nothing to do with me . \\n▁ i flushed a bit at how self absorbed i could be . \\n▁ but when you feel awful about yourself , it can seem like the entire world has their backs to you , whispering about you … condemning you . \\n▁ but how often is that really the case ? \\n▁ probably not as often as i 'd believed . \\n▁ as i studied people in the halls , i started to understand that truth more and more . \\n▁ mainly , i saw people going on about their own lives , wrapped up in their own drama , and most only registering me with a cursory glance . \\n▁ that 's not to say that everyone was talking about their own lives . \\n▁ a few heads were bent together in harsh whispers that stopped and turned into unblinking stares as i walked by . \\n▁ i even caught a few words in reference to my ` ` revelation '' - that i remembered the crash and had a version of those events that greatly differed from all the gossip . \\n▁ i was both relieved and pained to know that the truth was circulating amid the lies . \\n▁ i hoped the tide would start to shift now . \\n▁ as we entered the classroom , i noticed the several sets of curious and thoughtful eyes . \\n▁ those eyes took in my hand holding sawyer 's and i noticed a few smiles among the faces . \\n▁ i made myself meet every eye and smile back . \\n▁ that surprised quite a few of them and i started to wonder just how much i had shut down lately . \\n▁ ms . reynolds gave us a warm greeting , her hand touching sawyer 's shoulder , her eyes studying mine . \\n▁ i gave her a genuine smile and a friendly nod . \\n▁ sawyer 's distant cousin had always been kind to me and i had n't forgotten that . \\n▁ she spoke with us for a moment before class , asking how sawyer 's break went and how i 'd been . \\n▁ i was n't sure what she knew , but being family , i thought she probably knew a lot about what had really happened to me after i 'd left the dance . \\n▁ i told her i was ` ` better '' and she gave me a warm smile in response . \\n▁ sawyer and i made our way to our seats , parting ways to go down our separate aisles . \\n▁ i stopped at will 's desk when i noticed his foot slip out to trip me . \\n▁ inwardly i smiled - some things never change . \\n▁ i twisted to look him in the eye . \\n▁ he sat up straighter and gave me a defiant look in return . \\n▁ i let my inward smile show on my face . \\n▁ i 'd dealt with much worse than tripping , it seemed near silly and childish to me now . \\n▁ a slight laugh escaping me , i pointed at his foot . \\n▁ ` ` do you mind not tripping me anymore ? \\n▁ it 's kind of stupid … do n't you think ? '' \\n▁ a couple students seated near him laughed , randy included . \\n▁ will flushed and looked around , retracting his foot . \\n▁ ` ` whatever , lucas , '' he glowered . \\n▁ feeling magnanimous , i clapped his shoulder as i walked by . \\n▁ he seemed startled by that and turned to watch me walk back to sawyer . \\n▁ she was again beaming at me as i sat down . ' \\n▁ i love you , ' she mouthed . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , '' i said , loud enough for those around me to clearly hear . \\n▁ her eyes looked around and her cheeks filled with a light , rosy color . \\n▁ it was beautiful on her . \\n▁ ` ` come here . '' \\n▁ i leaned over , lifting my lips to her , and she smiled and leaned over as well . \\n▁ our mouths met in the middle of the aisle and we shared a brief kiss in the middle of class . \\n▁ sawyer , randy , will and i , got called into the principal 's office halfway through first period . \\n▁ that actually caused more of a stir among the students than sawyer and i kissing . \\n▁ i met eyes with a few faces as i left , and was a little surprised with the sympathy i saw there . \\n▁ we were brought into the principal 's office one - by - one and made to tell our version of the fight . \\n▁ while i 'd been hoping that the school would just let it slide , it appeared that they were n't going to . \\n▁ they just were n't sure what happened . \\n▁ as i was the last one of our group to enter , i began to understand why they were so confused . \\n▁ as i sat in the straight backed chair , i listened to the stern older woman before me as she gave me the conflicting details . \\n▁ as it turned out , there was a lot of debate over who had actually thrown the punch . \\n▁ half of the witnesses claimed josh did it , while the other half , claimed i struck him . \\n▁ sawyer stuck by my side , saying josh was a bully and cornered me . \\n▁ will stuck by josh , saying i flipped out and started wailing on him , and randy said he missed the first half , but tried to stop josh from attacking me . \\n▁ the rest of the student body that had been interviewed , was mixed between the views . \\n▁ there were so many questions over the matter , that the principal decided not to suspend either of us for the fight . \\n▁ she ended up giving josh and me a week of detention each instead , and ordered me more counseling , as well as a round of sessions for josh . \\n▁ i 'd been planning on continuing anyway , but it made me happy that josh had to go now too . \\n▁ truly that was for the best . \\n▁ he obviously had issues with his brother 's death , and would never be a better person if a professional did n't step in and help him . \\n▁ and i was positive beth could help him . \\n▁ one small benefit over the dissolution of our friendship , i suppose . \\n▁ josh was entering the outer office as i was leaving it . \\n▁ sawyer , having waited for me after her meeting , stood up and eyed us both nervously . \\n▁ i held josh 's eye and he held mine . \\n▁ neither of us spoke and an odd tension built up in the waiting room . \\n▁ finally , and surprisingly , josh looked down and muttered , ` ` sorry '' . \\n▁ my mouth dropped in shock until i understood . \\n▁ while coach had let me go with only a few words the night of the dance , he had held josh back and had a ` ` conversation '' with him . \\n▁ knowing full well just how intense a conversation with coach could be , i figured josh had had the fear of god put in him , much more so than the principal , with an empty threat of suspension , ever could . \\n▁ josh would n't mind getting a short vacation from campus for fighting , but getting ousted from the team next year - now that was enough to have him licking just about anyone 's heels . \\n▁ he was still looking glumly at the ground as i walked around him to sawyer . \\n▁ i grabbed her hand and made for the door . \\n▁ stopping halfway through the open doorframe , i turned to look back at him . \\n▁ he was still staring at the floor , his head bent down . \\n▁ for a moment , i remembered the happy , smiling kid that used to hang off darren 's shoulders , wanting to be just like his big brother . \\n▁ sadness entered me at how little of that person was left . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , josh . \\n▁ i loved him too . '' \\n▁ josh lifted his head and looked back at me , tears in his eyes now . \\n▁ i swallowed at the sight , my own eyes watering . \\n▁ josh only stared at me a moment , then nodded and made his way to the principal 's office . \\n▁ sawyer and i both exhaled together , squeezing each other 's hands and preparing for the remainder of our day . \\n▁ it went by smoother than i 'd imagine it would . \\n▁ as i continued forcing myself to meet people 's glances and acknowledge them with smiles or nods , they started feeling more comfortable around me . \\n▁ by mr . varner 's class , some of the people around me , felt comfortable enough to ask me if what they 'd heard about the dance was true - if i 'd really confessed that i remembered everything , if i 'd really been sober and the rain had really caused the wreck . \\n▁ it made a knot form in my stomach and i had to fight the natural urge to shut down and not tell them anything , but with sawyer squeezing my knee , i finally did confess the truth around the events of that night . \\n▁ mr . varner snapped at the room on more than a few occasions , as whispers of questions and xxunk swirled around me , but by the time class was over , the people in it looked at me differently . \\n▁ it was much the same in the remainder of my classes . \\n▁ most people just had no idea what to believe and they 'd taken my half - hearted denials , mixed with my silence , as an admission of guilt . \\n▁ it generally only took me explaining things once , for people 's questioning glances to turn sympathetic . \\n▁ and i found that the more i talked about it , the easier it was to do that . \\n▁ eventually , i did n't even tear up when people asked . \\n▁ i was feeling a lot more comfortable in the school , and in all honesty , with myself , when i got to astronomy . \\n▁ there was something healing in a handful of peers telling you that it was an accident , and you were n't to blame . \\n▁ there was also something soothing in those same students apologizing for thinking badly of me . \\n▁ it did n't make up for all the tiny tortures i 'd endured , but it helped . \\n▁ do n't get me wrong , not everyone instantly liked me again . \\n▁ as i walked through the halls or into the classrooms , there was still an occasional angry shake of the head and hard stare , but not everyone can be convinced of the truth . \\n▁ some people will believe what they want to believe . \\n▁ sometimes you have to do that , just to make sense of the world . \\n▁ i understood that , and did n't hold it against anyone who felt the need to make me the villain . \\n▁ i just was n't going to agree with them anymore . \\n▁ that was my goal anyway . \\n▁ as i walked through the astronomy doors , my eyes automatically went to josh . \\n▁ he kept his head down , not looking at me . \\n▁ i nodded my head , accepting the truth of our relationship , and made my way to my seat . \\n▁ i did n't know if josh finally believed me , but i knew he 'd finally leave me alone . \\n▁ i found what solace in that that i could , and silently wished him well as i watched him throughout class . \\n▁ a few more people came up to me afterwards , and i made myself talk with them , being as open and honest as i could . \\n▁ one or two offered to walk me to my next class and i conceded , not sure if i wanted the company , but wanting to fit back in with people . \\n▁ they chatted about events in their lives and i nodded and supplied a few ` i ' m listening ' responses . \\n▁ my thoughts were more on josh though , as i watched him disappear to his next class . \\n▁ my mind focused back onto the things i could feel good about in art class . \\n▁ mrs . xxunk gave us back some of our pieces that she 'd finally gotten around to grading over the break . \\n▁ calling me tom , and telling me , once again , how much talent she thought i had , she handed me back the charcoal drawing i 'd done of sawyer . \\n▁ she 'd given me an a. i smiled as i smoothed out the paper image of the woman i knew so well , a woman who 'd brought me back from the brink . \\n▁ my finger traced the curve of her cheek on the paper and i suddenly knew what i wanted to do with this piece that meant so much to me . \\n▁ i tucked it in my backpack and got to work on the next image of the woman i loved . \\n▁ not too much later , i saw her again . \\n▁ her black hair streamed behind her in the crisp breeze , her small frame wrapped in my letterman 's jacket . \\n▁ now i loved how my name across her back implied my claim on her . \\n▁ underneath that jacket , i knew she was wearing her typical long - sleeve shirt , and i also knew that shirt was doing much more than just keeping her warm . \\n▁ her thumb ring flashed in a sudden bright patch of sunlight and its triumphant shine matched the triumphant look on her face as she walked over to me . \\n▁ i smiled at seeing the happy glow in her eyes , wondering if i had anything to do with it . \\n▁ she slung her arms around my neck when we finally met up in - between the buildings housing art and choir . \\n▁ she immediately leaned up to lightly press her lips to mine . \\n▁ mine were smiling as she pulled away . \\n▁ my hands automatically curled around her waist and we held each other , like we 'd been apart all day , and not just the last two classes . \\n▁ ` ` why does it feel like forever since i ' ve seen you ? '' \\n▁ she asked , echoing my thoughts again . \\n▁ i grinned and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` because it has been . '' \\n▁ she rolled her eyes , but laughed , the look of victory still on her face . \\n▁ i cocked an eye brow as i studied her . \\n▁ ` ` something … going on ? '' \\n▁ she grinned and removed one of her hands from my neck , showing me a note tucked inside her fingers . \\n▁ i felt my face scrunch as i tried to figure out what it was . \\n▁ i grabbed it from her cool grasp and unfolded it with one hand while she watched me with a wry smile . \\n▁ as familiar handwriting popped out at me , i startled and met her gaze again . \\n▁ ` ` our note ? \\n▁ the one josh knew about ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` what happened to it ? '' \\n▁ she shrugged and hugged me tighter . \\n▁ ` ` your favorite ` ex ' had apparently stolen it from my bag , probably that same day . \\n▁ i had n't noticed then , but sally told me that she 'd heard brittany bragging about it today . '' \\n▁ she gave me a wink and a sly smile . \\n▁ ` ` so i made sure i got it back . '' \\n▁ i shook my head at her , wondering how she 'd accomplished that . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , '' i muttered , before lowering my lips to hers again . \\n▁ she chuckled , but could n't answer me since my lips were n't exactly letting her speak . \\n▁ i did n't need her to say it back to me anyway . \\n▁ i already knew exactly how much sawyer loved me . \\n▁ she 'd proven that to me on the highway . \\n▁ her fingers curled up to my hair as mine ran up her back , pulling her tighter . \\n▁ behind her , i heard a series of disgruntled noises and i cracked my eyes open . \\n▁ i could just make out brittany , standing several feet away from us , watching us kiss . \\n▁ i closed my eyes again , blocking her out . \\n▁ i could n't help brittany 's petty jealousies … which i was fairly certain was all it was for her . \\n▁ she had never shown me anything even close to resembling love , not even way back , when we 'd been fooling around . \\n▁ it was one of the reasons that it had been so easy for me to discount the encounter . \\n▁ i was a toy to her , something she enjoyed playing with and did n't like to share , but she definitely was n't above chucking me to the curb when it suited her purpose . \\n▁ that sort of game was n't something i 'd ever had any interest in playing , regardless of how attractive she was . \\n▁ my hands tightened on sawyer , reveling in someone who actually did care about me . \\n▁ as the noises behind her finally faded into silence , i remembered what i 'd wanted to do earlier in art . \\n▁ i broke apart from our kiss and smiled down at her . \\n▁ her mouth was still parted , her breath just slightly heavier and her eyes slightly glassy . \\n▁ it was an astoundingly attractive look , one that hinted at where our relationship could eventually go , and i swallowed at seeing it . \\n▁ blinking and stammering on vague , incoherent words , i reached behind me to my backpack . \\n▁ she released her grip on me when she understood what i was doing . \\n▁ looking more put together , she watched me curiously . \\n▁ grinning , i found the picture i 'd drawn and handed it to her . \\n▁ she tucked our ` ` note '' in her pocket , before taking my picture and unfolding it . \\n▁ her mouth fell open as she looked over the intricate , charcoal version of her that i 'd drawn . \\n▁ as she was speechless for so long , i started getting nervous that she did n't like it . \\n▁ maybe she thought it was creepy or something . \\n▁ i started to anxiously shift my weight back and forth , waiting for some response from her . \\n▁ finally her eyes lifted from the paper ; they were watery as she gazed at me dumbfounded . \\n▁ she shook her head and tried to speak , but could n't . \\n▁ as i scrunched my brow , she finally swallowed and said , ` ` you drew … me ? '' \\n▁ i nodded and smiled , relaxing at the awe i heard in her voice . \\n▁ ` ` i always draw you . \\n▁ i always have , '' i added in a whisper . \\n▁ she looked back down to the paper , her finger tracing the same curve on her cheek that i had earlier . \\n▁ ` ` you drew me … beautiful , '' she murmured quietly , clearly taken aback that i 'd do such a thing . \\n▁ my hand came up to her chin , lifting it so she 'd look at me . \\n▁ ` ` you are beautiful . '' \\n▁ a tear dropped to her cheek and i brushed it off with my thumb . \\n▁ her watery eyes flicked between mine as the chilly wind continued to blow her hair around her , lifting and releasing the ends in a continual wave of motion . \\n▁ ` ` i love it . \\n▁ i love you , lucas . '' \\n▁ i smiled and bent down to kiss her again . \\n▁ by the time we broke apart , we were both late for our next appointments . \\n▁ we parted ways in front of the purity club door . \\n▁ she playfully grabbed the edges of my jacket , pulling me to her for a quick kiss . \\n▁ i chuckled and turned it into a longer kiss . \\n▁ she sighed , and looked at me a little dreamily as she pulled away . \\n▁ i shook my head as i watched her open the door and disappear into the packed classroom . \\n▁ sometimes , it was still hard to believe that someone like her , could love someone like me . \\n▁ but i could see now that that thought was more driven by the self hatred than anything else . \\n▁ before the wreck , i 'd never questioned the fact that someone as beautiful and amazing as lillian had loved me ; it had never even occurred to me back then , that i was n't worthy of her . \\n▁ no , all of my self - doubt was because of the crash , and my part in it . \\n▁ self loathing can do a number on your self esteem and i was still working on that . \\n▁ as i opened the door stenciled with the word ` ` counselor '' in bold , black letters , a smile crept to my face . \\n▁ i was working on that , and this was the person who 'd help me . \\n▁ her smile was broad and beaming as she noticed me walking through her door . \\n▁ her flaming hair was loose around her , large curls spilling around her shoulders , highlighting her crystal blue eyes . \\n▁ those eyes glowed at me with genuine affection as i took my seat across from her . \\n▁ i sat with a genuinely affectionate smile on my face and marveled at how drastically my attitude about coming here had changed since the beginning . \\n▁ aside from being with sawyer , sitting down with beth was one of the high points in my day . \\n▁ ` ` good to see you , lucas , '' she replied warmly , her eyes crinkling around the corners , showing a lifetime of happy moments , one of which appeared to be me . \\n▁ i beamed at her , relaxing back into my seat . \\n▁ ` ` good to see you too , beth . '' \\n▁ her smile widened at my casual use of her first name . \\n▁ i 'd resisted speaking to her with any type of familiarity for a long time , but after my moment on the highway , i 'd needed to let her in , to save myself . \\n▁ much like i had every day since i 'd called her , i began telling her what was on my mind . \\n▁ she 'd surprised me over winter break , by showing up at my house every morning . \\n▁ she definitely was n't under any obligation to do that , and it had definitely seemed above and beyond anything a school grief counselor should have to do , but she had n't listened to my halfhearted attempts to tell her it was n't necessary . \\n▁ she 'd simply told me it was , and goaded me to talk to her . \\n▁ i had n't been as relaxed and free speaking as i was being now , as i told her about my meeting with the principal and running into josh throughout the day . \\n▁ no , even after pouring out my soul the day of the highway incident , it had been a struggle to force myself to talk to her . \\n▁ after shutting down for so long , opening up is a gradual , painful process . \\n▁ maybe that 's what she 'd meant when she said it was necessary to see me every day . \\n▁ maybe she knew , that if she did n't strike while the iron was hot , i 'd start closing up again . \\n▁ i do n't know . \\n▁ like i 'd told her once before , she was the one with all the diplomas , not me . \\n▁ with a smile on my face , i told her about giving the picture i 'd drawn of sawyer to her , and her reaction to me portraying her as beautifully as i saw her . \\n▁ she smiled with one edge of her lip as she twisted a pencil in her hands . \\n▁ ` ` sometimes , we do n't see ourselves as clearly as others do . '' \\n▁ i looked up at her and nodded , knowing she was n't necessarily talking about sawyer anymore . \\n▁ she smiled more at seeing me agree with her statement . \\n▁ awhile ago , i would have disagreed with her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad you 'll be coming to see me for a bit longer , lucas . '' \\n▁ i nodded and looked down . \\n▁ i 'd told her about my punishment for fighting with josh , the additional counseling i 'd been given , part of the school 's new policy to try and rehabilitate students , instead of just outright punishing them . \\n▁ as i thought about how much being here had helped me , i thought maybe the school was on to something . \\n▁ i started to have a little hope for josh . \\n▁ i hoped he 'd open up to beth easier than i had . \\n▁ she continued as i thought about that . \\n▁ ` ` honestly , lucas , i wish i had seen you earlier … the first day of school , if not immediately after the tragedy . '' \\n▁ i looked up at her again , shifting my thoughts back to that horrid time . \\n▁ mom had tried on a few occasions to get me to a counselor , but she may as well have stuck me in an empty room , for all the good it had done me . \\n▁ i just had n't been ready to talk to anyone . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't like talking about … stuff … to anyone . '' \\n▁ she nodded her head , tapping her pencil on her desk a couple times . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve noticed that . '' \\n▁ i chuckled at that and smiled softly . \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` but you 're doing so much better . \\n▁ you ' ve come a long way in opening up , lucas . \\n▁ that 's very hard to do , especially to a complete stranger . \\n▁ you should be very proud of yourself . '' \\n▁ feeling embarrassed , i hung my head and shrugged . \\n▁ thinking about that , i wondered if she was proud of me for trying to escape life , by living in a fantasy . \\n▁ i ca n't imagine she 'd say that was healthy … or normal . \\n▁ i cringed , but asked her anyway . \\n▁ ` ` is what i did , creating a dream world with my friends , crazy ? '' \\n▁ feeling pale , i asked , ` ` am i nuts ? '' \\n▁ i peeked up at her , cringing . \\n▁ she looked at me for a moment , tapping her pencil against her lip before answering . \\n▁ ` ` just you asking that , shows that you 're not crazy . '' \\n▁ i found myself relaxing infinitesimally and it surprised me . \\n▁ i had n't realized i 'd tensed waiting for her answer . \\n▁ i guess some part of me , really had been worried that she 'd confirm what i was secretly afraid of . \\n▁ she smiled as she watched me sit back in my chair . \\n▁ ` ` lucas , you ' ve been through something that most people ca n't even contemplate , or even want to . '' \\n▁ she shook her head and i watched the red curls swish over her shoulders , blankly letting her words enter my head . \\n▁ ` ` i think your mind dealt with it , in the only way it could . \\n▁ it may not have been the healthiest option … but i 'd say you 're doing pretty well , considering . '' \\n▁ i allowed myself a wry smile at that . \\n▁ ` ` considering , i almost tried to kill myself , to join my dream friends ? '' \\n▁ i was a little surprised at how casually i could talk about the biggest -lrb- well , second biggest -rrb- tragic event of my life . \\n▁ that was just a testament to how comfortable i 'd become around beth . \\n▁ she smiled wryly in return . \\n▁ ` ` but you did n't and you asked for help . \\n▁ you asked for my help . '' \\n▁ she cocked her head to the side . \\n▁ ` ` that 's pretty huge , compared to how you were when you moodily slumped into my chair a few weeks ago . \\n▁ do n't you think ? '' \\n▁ her words echoed my earlier thoughts regarding my time spent here and i smiled at hearing our minds run in parallel . \\n▁ a soft laugh escaped me as i stared at my hands on my lap , remembering my moody first day . \\n▁ ` ` maybe … '' she sighed softly and i glanced up at her from the corner of my eye . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't imagine exactly what you ' ve gone through , lucas , but i can imagine your pain . '' \\n▁ i lifted my head , another wry smile twisting my lips . \\n▁ ` ` you can imagine the pain of murdering all of your friends ? '' \\n▁ i instantly regretted saying it , both because of how callus it sounded , and because a slice of pain went right through me at saying it . \\n▁ things were better , but i was n't like i was magically healed and the death of my friends did n't ever bother me anymore . \\n▁ it did . \\n▁ healing does n't happen overnight . \\n▁ it 's painfully slow , and my friend 's absence still shook me to my core on occasion . \\n▁ i hung my head again . \\n▁ beth took in my changed expression and placed a few fingers on my shoulder . \\n▁ i looked up and could tell tears were in my eyes . \\n▁ i blinked them away , not wanting to cry today . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't murder them , lucas . \\n▁ in your heart , you know that . \\n▁ it was an accident … a tragic accident . '' \\n▁ i cocked my head as i watched her face twist with sympathy for me . \\n▁ feeling warm and safe in her spa - like oasis , i said something that i 'd have never uttered just a few weeks ago . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think it was an accident . '' \\n▁ she blinked and scrunched her forehead . \\n▁ i was one hundred percent sure she believed me , when i said i 'd been sober , and rain and speed had been my downfall that night . \\n▁ she also knew i was well aware of what caused the crash , so i could almost see her mind trying to grasp what i meant by my statement . \\n▁ ` ` of course it was , lucas . \\n▁ what else would it be ? '' \\n▁ i looked down , not able to meet her eyes anymore . \\n▁ ` ` it was carelessness , recklessness . \\n▁ it was me thinking that we were invincible and not … slowing down , to think about just how precious what i had been carrying was … '' i peeked up at her , those tears in my eyes again . \\n▁ ` ` it was me being stupid . '' \\n▁ her fingers clenched my shoulder sympathetically before pulling away . \\n▁ a soft , sad smile played across her lips . \\n▁ ` ` sort of the definition of ` accident ' , do n't you think ? '' \\n▁ i swallowed , shaking my head . \\n▁ ` ` no … it feels … more like fate . '' \\n▁ i swallowed , not sure if she 'd understand that . \\n▁ i was n't sure if i did either , it was just an overriding sense in me sometimes , like , no matter what i 'd done differently that night … i 'd still be here , in this office , mourning . \\n▁ she cocked her head , confused again . \\n▁ ` ` you think you fated your friends to die ? '' \\n▁ it sounded so silly when she said it like that , that i sighed and hung my head . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` but , they are dead because of me . '' \\n▁ silence filled the room . \\n▁ well , not exactly silence as she had some soothing , light jazz playing in the background , but beth did n't respond to what i 'd said . \\n▁ i let the silence between us stretch on for as long as i could stand , then i glanced up at her . \\n▁ she was watching me , a thoughtful expression on her freckled face . \\n▁ finally , in a low voice , she spoke . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't accept forgiveness from others , until you accept it from yourself , lucas . '' \\n▁ i swallowed back the ache that line gave me . \\n▁ it hit so close to home . \\n▁ trying to shrug off the pain of self - hatred that always lingered around the edges of my being , i gave her a weak , wry smile . \\n▁ ` ` that sounds straight out of a textbook . '' \\n▁ she did n't give me the smile i expected in return . \\n▁ instead , her look remained completely serious as she studied my expression . \\n▁ i could feel my eyes water again under that gaze , and i stopped trying to halt the feeling that i was having . \\n▁ i let my eyes completely water and let the tears drop to my cheeks . \\n▁ her face still showing no humor , her pale eyes watching my tears fall , she calmly said , ` ` it 's written in a textbook for a reason . '' \\n▁ i could only nod as i silently cried . \\n▁ i suppose it was . \\n▁ i knew i had to let this go , this feeling of loathing i had for myself . \\n▁ i knew i needed to come to some sort of peaceful arrangement , if i ever wanted to move forward , and i knew my friends and lillian would have wanted that for me . \\n▁ i knew sawyer and my mom wanted that for me . \\n▁ and a tiny , tiny speck of me , wanted that for me . \\n▁ finally , beth 's face relaxed and she sighed softly , bringing her hand back to my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll get you there , luc . \\n▁ i promise . '' \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; and josh … well , after second semester started , and sawyer and i came up with a schedule that got us four out of five classes together plus a free ` ` study '' period , i did n't see him much . \\n▁ the school was n't big enough for me to never see him again , but without a class together , the contact we had was pretty minimal - brushing past each other in the hall , watching him fight with his girlfriend across campus , or occasionally spotting him talking with will on the steps of the main building as sawyer and i approached for first period . \\n▁ he did n't speak much to me , and he did n't try and start anything either . \\n▁ it was almost like i 'd become invisible to him . \\n▁ almost . \\n▁ sometimes , i 'd catch him watching me from the other end of the hall or staring at me a little longer than was necessary as we passed by each other on the stairs . \\n▁ i did n't know what he thought of me , if he still hated me , still blamed me . \\n▁ i 'd thought to ask beth what he 'd said about me during their sessions , but decided against it . \\n▁ what she and i discussed was nothing i 'd want her to talk about with anyone else , not that she would , and i had to believe that josh felt the same . \\n▁ it was nearly three months after our brief words to each other in the principal 's office , when i was sure we 'd never speak again , that we ran into each other in the first floor men 's room . \\n▁ i was washing my hands when he walked in the door . \\n▁ i looked up in the mirror automatically and my eyes did a double take when i registered him standing in the open frame . \\n▁ his eyes locked with mine , and for a second , i was sure he was going to leave . \\n▁ no one else was in here and i was pretty sure josh did n't want to be alone with me . \\n▁ surprisingly , he did n't . \\n▁ he sniffed and looked down , then walked into the room , letting the door swing closed behind him . \\n▁ i stepped away from the sink , wiping my hands off on my jeans , and wondering what to say to him . \\n▁ he kept his head down and made like he was going to go to a stall , to shut me out . \\n▁ but then he paused and looked back at me . \\n▁ i swallowed and my face softened at the haggard look on his . \\n▁ his dark eyes had nearly as dark of circles underneath them . \\n▁ his dark hair was shaggy and unkempt , as disheveled as his baggy clothes under his baggy letterman 's jacket . \\n▁ he looked more tired than i 'd ever seen him , and i could n't help but think that no matter the struggles we 'd gone through earlier in the year , i wanted to see him smiling and happy again . \\n▁ a tiny part of me even wanted him to start attacking me again . \\n▁ even if his smile had been a vindictive one back then , it had at least been a smile . \\n▁ my brow furrowed in concern for him . \\n▁ ` ` are you … okay ? '' \\n▁ it occurred to me then , that even though josh had a circle of friends , none of them were probably that invested in his happiness . \\n▁ josh did n't exactly have a ` ` sawyer '' to look after him . \\n▁ he blinked , seemingly taken back that i 'd ask him that . \\n▁ he started to shake his head , like he was going to say he was fine , but then he sighed and seemed to slump . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i miss him . '' \\n▁ i swallowed and nodded , walking over to stand in front of josh . \\n▁ he looked up at me , blinking slowly , like he wanted to sleep , but had n't been able to in a really long time . \\n▁ i completely understood that . \\n▁ ` ` i do too … every day . '' \\n▁ josh nodded and looked at our feet . \\n▁ he was silent for long seconds and i started to think that maybe he 'd said all he was going to say to me . \\n▁ i debated turning to leave , when he spoke again . \\n▁ ` ` you swear you were sober … ? '' \\n▁ i bit my lip and swallowed back the lump that suddenly seized up my throat . \\n▁ josh peeked up at me , just a hint of anger in his dark eyes as he waited for my answer , waited to see if i 'd be truthful . \\n▁ i slowly nodded and my voice was thick when it finally came out . \\n▁ ` ` i swear , josh . \\n▁ i swear on his grave . \\n▁ it was just a really horrible … accident . '' \\n▁ relief coursed through me as that word passed my lips , relief and a small trickle of peace . \\n▁ it had been an accident and finally admitting that to someone , made me feel a thousand times lighter . \\n▁ josh cocked his head , gauging the sincerity in my voice . \\n▁ finally , he swallowed and looked down again , but not before i saw the tears start to form . \\n▁ i let him keep his emotion hidden from me , let him keep his head down . \\n▁ i put my hand on his shoulder , clenching it hard . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry , josh . \\n▁ if i could do that night over … '' i did n't finish that . \\n▁ it was pretty much implied anyway that of course i 'd do things differently . \\n▁ i just did n't know what . \\n▁ what had happened was n't something that i could have prevented without some foresight of what was going to happen . \\n▁ at the time i 'd been doing what i could to be a responsible friend , driving my other drunken friends home . \\n▁ maybe i could have slowed my speed , maybe i could have made sure my friends were safely buckled . \\n▁ but really , would that have changed the outcome ? \\n▁ i felt another trickle of peace come into me . \\n▁ i 'd done what i could … the rest had n't been up to me . \\n▁ josh looked up at my touch , his cheeks wet , and nodded solemnly . \\n▁ i wanted to hug him , but did n't really want to stress this tenuous connection we were having . \\n▁ wanting to help in some way , but not knowing how , i removed my hand and awkwardly put it back in my pocket . \\n▁ ` ` i hear you got sent to mrs . ryans . '' \\n▁ he nodded , his eyes guarded , and i continued with a shrug of my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` yeah . \\n▁ i was n't too thrilled to see her at first either . '' \\n▁ i looked down and added quietly , ` ` she really helped me though . '' \\n▁ i bit my lip to not ask him if she had helped him , if she still was helping him . \\n▁ i slyly peeked up at him , to read his face . \\n▁ he was staring away from me , gazing at the door . \\n▁ i wondered if he was debating leaving , but instead of moving , he spoke , ` ` she has been helping , i guess . \\n▁ it 's hard … but i ' m starting to like talking to her . '' \\n▁ i looked up and he met my gaze . \\n▁ smiling , i nodded at him . \\n▁ ` ` good . '' \\n▁ the silence stretched between us as we simply looked at each other . \\n▁ thinking sawyer was going to bust in here looking for me , i shifted to move . \\n▁ my adjustment broke our silent stare down and as my head twisted to the door , he spoke again . \\n▁ ` ` do you still feel like killing yourself ? '' \\n▁ i hesitated and looked back at him , wondering if he knew about the highway . \\n▁ his eyes watered again as his face became tragically sad . \\n▁ he lightly shook his head and with a wavering voice said , ` ` does that ever go away ? '' \\n▁ finally understanding that he was n't really talking about my mental state , that he was talking about his own , i turned back to him , putting my hand on his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` no , i do n't want to die anymore . '' \\n▁ pointedly meeting his eye , i calmly said , ` ` it gets better . \\n▁ day by day … it does get better . '' \\n▁ he swallowed and nodded , his head hanging down again . \\n▁ deciding it was warranted , i gave him a swift hug . \\n▁ ` ` call me if you need to , josh . '' \\n▁ he mumbled something sounding like an agreement as he loosely hugged me back . \\n▁ feeling like josh needed a minute alone to pull himself back together , i made my way to the door . \\n▁ as i was opening it , i heard him say , ` ` i ' m sorry for drugging you , lucas . '' \\n▁ i looked back at his sad , tired face , wondering if i 'd ever again see that kid i used to know . \\n▁ i nodded at him and made my way out to the hallway , where sawyer immediately grasped my hand and asked me if i was okay . \\n▁ i chuckled at her never ending concern and told her everything that had just happened . \\n▁ later with beth , i repeated the encounter . \\n▁ she did n't seem surprised to hear it and i thought maybe josh had told her already . \\n▁ it pleased me that he was opening up to her as well . \\n▁ again my hope for him soared . \\n▁ we talked more about josh and then our conversation shifted to the topic it had started shifting to of late , sawyer and i. i talked openly to beth about everything - past and present , and my virginal status was no exception . \\n▁ as the months of a comforting relationship with sawyer went by , i started to feel something that surprised me a little . \\n▁ i started to feel like i wanted to move forward with her , beyond what i 'd done with any girl . \\n▁ that was a pretty big step for me , considering the fact that i 'd been holding out for a dead girl for a really long time now . \\n▁ expecting a typical ` wait until you 're married ' response from the adult across from me , i was pretty surprised when she said she thought that was fine , as long as we were ready , emotionally and physically . \\n▁ she cautioned me to be safe with our bodies and our hearts . \\n▁ i found that much more helpful advice . \\n▁ as it turned out , the physical aspect of safety was n't an issue . \\n▁ sawyer had confessed to me one night , during a frankly honest conversation , that her parents had put her on the pill after her suicide attempt , when the truth behind her reason for the attempt had come out . \\n▁ they 'd assumed a ` better safe than sorry ' approach to the whole matter and sawyer had n't felt the need to tell them it was an unnecessary precaution , since she was n't planning on sleeping with anyone ever again after her one awful experience . \\n▁ of course , once she 'd met me , taking the pill had seemed wise to her too and she 'd continued with it . \\n▁ it made me flush , thinking of how soon into our meeting that she 'd been interested in me … like that . \\n▁ she 'd been responsible enough her first time , that they 'd used a condom . \\n▁ that turned out to be a good thing , since he 'd turned out to be a two or three or six timing a * * hole . \\n▁ since she was protected from pregnancy now , thanks to her overprotective parents , and both of our fairly inexperienced bodies were completely healthy , she 'd told me that when we were ready to go there , she did n't want a condom barrier with me . \\n▁ she did n't want anymore barriers between us , physical or otherwise . \\n▁ the entire revelation made me oddly happy . \\n▁ i 'd be the first man to be inside her , skin to skin -lrb- and hopefully the last -rrb- . \\n▁ it was n't exactly virginity , but it was enough to make me feel like i 'd have a lifelong claim on her . \\n▁ wow , i guess i was a little possessive . \\n▁ that made our bodies pretty safe and sound , leaving just our hearts to consider . \\n▁ and as we spent more and more time together intimately , loving each other with tender kisses and caresses , i felt more and more at ease with the future of our hearts . \\n▁ she loved me … and i loved her . \\n▁ now that i was n't holding a part of myself away from her , the level of love i felt was nearly astonishing . \\n▁ it was something i 'd convinced myself i 'd never feel again for a living person . \\n▁ and i wanted to show her how deeply i felt it , but i wanted to make sure i was ready for the right reasons . \\n▁ well , to be honest , i held off partially because of nerves . \\n▁ but mainly , i held off because i wanted to make sure the moment had nothing to do with lillian . \\n▁ i had n't dreamt of my friends since they 'd said goodbye to me , and i felt relief and sadness from that . \\n▁ i knew it was all in my head , but then again , i 'd known that all along . \\n▁ that did n't make the fantasy any less addicting , knowing it was fake . \\n▁ it had almost made it better , since i 'd had some level of control , although never as much as i 'd wanted . \\n▁ but still , a part of me wanted that fantasy back , if anything , just to say goodbye less painfully . \\n▁ it eluded me though and my dreams were constantly … forgettable . \\n▁ as sawyer and i got even closer to each other , i took this to be a good thing , like lillian 's absence was her way of saying , ` go ahead , live your life . \\n▁ i wo n't interfere ' . \\n▁ i wanted to tell sawyer that . \\n▁ i wanted to tell her that i was finally ready to go through that final step with her , that i 'd let my past with lillian go . \\n▁ days later , when we were in my room after baseball practice , that she had stayed to watch , as she often did , i lazily ran my fingers through her hair as she lay beside me on my bed , and thought maybe i finally could . \\n▁ my mom had the night off from the diner and was having a nice dinner with sheriff whitney . \\n▁ since their relationship had gone ` ` public '' , they 'd decided to tell his wife the truth . \\n▁ they had decided to do it together , and i 'd supported their decision . \\n▁ a real relationship could n't be continued on lies , from either party . \\n▁ from what i 'd heard later from my mom , his wife had n't been surprised by the announcement . \\n▁ with a heavy sigh , she 'd admitted that she knew ; her husband had n't been that great at hiding the secret and she had known for a couple years . \\n▁ she also admitted that she did n't mind . \\n▁ that seemed odd to me at first , until my mom explained it farther . \\n▁ his wife knew that she was dying and she wanted to leave her husband happy , and mom made him happy . \\n▁ while living arrangements were going to stay the same until his wife passed , so he could care for her , albeit it in separate bedrooms , their relationship was now out for everyone to see , and date nights were a more and more frequent thing . \\n▁ my mom was happier than i 'd ever seen her , and i let my misgivings about the nature of their relationship go . \\n▁ if all parties were okay with it , who was i to criticize it ? \\n▁ so mom was out with her boyfriend for the night and sawyer 's parents were n't expecting her back for another couple hours , since they were pretty comfortable with me at this point , and allowed sawyer much longer ` ` visits '' . \\n▁ we were alone … completely alone . \\n▁ no parents … no ghosts . \\n▁ no one but the two of us were here in my room , and in my head . \\n▁ as we kissed and wrapped our arms and legs around each other , i felt like it was the perfect time to tell her that i wanted to be with her , that i was ready to be with her . \\n▁ i just did n't know how to bring it up . \\n▁ but , as she so often did when we were together , sawyer spoke my thoughts for me . \\n▁ her hand came up and the backs of her fingers ran over my cheek as she lovingly gazed up at me . \\n▁ i leaned down to kiss her , but her voice stopped me . \\n▁ ` ` i feel like we ' ve gotten really close , lucas . \\n▁ and if you 're ready to move forward … so am i. '' i pulled back and gazed at her suddenly serious expression . \\n▁ her eyes flicked between mine as she softly continued , ` ` i do n't want to rush you , if it 's still too soon after … '' she shrugged and bit her lip . \\n▁ ` ` i just wanted you to know … that if you were ready … i would n't say no . '' \\n▁ her hand cupped my cheek as her eyes looked over my face . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i swallowed back the almost overwhelming emotion at hearing her simple declaration . \\n▁ it passed so easily from her lips , yet carried such weight with it . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , sawyer . '' \\n▁ my fingers running through her hair stopped at her jaw and my thumb brushed her tender skin . \\n▁ i thought about her words , about everything we 'd been through this year , about everything we 'd been through in our short lives . \\n▁ and , as i traced the perfect heart - shaped double arch of her upper lip with my thumb , i thought about lil … about everything i 'd lost with her , because we 'd waited for so long . \\n▁ ` ` i am ready , sawyer . \\n▁ i ' m ready … right now . '' \\n▁ i leaned in to kiss her , but she pulled away from me . \\n▁ she eyed me warily as i cocked my head at her reaction . \\n▁ ` ` are you … sure ? '' \\n▁ i smiled softly and shook my head . \\n▁ my hand came up to tenderly stroke across her brow , following a long piece of hair at the crown all the way down to her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i could n't be surer . '' \\n▁ i followed where the long lock hooked over her shirt , lightly grazing the fabric with the back of my knuckle . \\n▁ ` ` if this past year has taught me anything … it 's do n't put off the important things . '' \\n▁ my eyes lifted from where they 'd been watching my fingers trace the swirl of her hair . \\n▁ ` ` i waited so long with lil … i never even got the chance to tell her i loved her , much less … '' i swallowed back that thought and started on a different one . \\n▁ ` ` you and i have held off until i was sure i could … be with someone else . '' \\n▁ my eyes searched hers intently . \\n▁ ` ` i can , and i do n't want to wait anymore . \\n▁ i do n't want to hold back being with someone i love … and i love you , sawyer . \\n▁ with everything inside of me , i love you and i want to show you . '' \\n▁ i looked down and felt the heat in my body , the desire in my voice . \\n▁ ` ` i want to make love to you … '' i raised my eyes to hers . \\n▁ they misted as she gazed up at me and then her hands tangled in my hair and pulled me to her . \\n▁ her lips met mine intensely and i shifted my body , so i was lying more directly on top of her . \\n▁ one of her hands trailed down my back as i pressed my body into hers . \\n▁ she gasped at the feel of me and hitched her leg around mine , drawing us tighter . \\n▁ i groaned and deepened the kiss , feeling her tongue slide against mine . \\n▁ her hands tugged at my shirt and i helped her lift the fabric over my head . \\n▁ her eyes drifted down my chest as her fingernails lightly dragged down my muscles . \\n▁ i hissed in a soft breath while hers caught . \\n▁ our eyes met again and my body heated even more at the desire i saw in hers . \\n▁ our lips met as her hands reattached themselves to my wavy , mess of hair . \\n▁ my hand slid up her shirt as our mouths tasted , felt , caressed each other 's . \\n▁ i felt her taut n * * ples through the light fabric of her bra and a quiver went through my body . \\n▁ she moaned in my mouth when i ran my thumbs over the sensitive peaks . \\n▁ needing more of her bare skin , i tore the shirt off of her and paused to stare down at the black see - through bra that was the same dark shade as her hair . \\n▁ i stopped breathing . \\n▁ ` ` do you like it ? '' \\n▁ i managed to drag my eyes up to her face , her lips twisted in a soft smile . \\n▁ ` ` the underwear matches , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i closed my eyes as a shudder went through me and a throb pulsed through my lower body . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i like it . '' \\n▁ my fingers ran behind her back as my lips traveled along her jaw to her ear . \\n▁ gently tugging on a lobe , i muttered , ` ` i almost hate to take it off … '' she whimpered and arched her back and my hand bunched the fabric and unsnapped the hinge . \\n▁ smoothly , i pulled it off her shoulders and gazed down at her undeniable beauty , unadorned and unhampered by seductive fabric . \\n▁ she was perfect . \\n▁ ` ` you 're beautiful , '' i murmured as my head lowered to taste that tempting skin . \\n▁ she pressed my head into her breast as my tongue flicked and stroked her nipple . \\n▁ she moaned and rocked her h * ps when i ran my teeth over the tender flesh . \\n▁ she was panting and rubbing her legs up mine provocatively when i switched to the other one . \\n▁ her h * ps rocked again as i trailed soft kisses down her abdomen . \\n▁ my hands lightly ran down her sides , tickling her , and she laughed softly and then groaned . \\n▁ i flicked my tongue in her belly button and closed my eyes at the moan she made . \\n▁ it went straight to my already hard body and i knew i needed her to touch me soon . \\n▁ i drew a line with my nose to her waistband and kissed the button on her jeans before i unhooked it . \\n▁ she groaned and helped me unzip and remove them . \\n▁ i bit my lip when i saw the aforementioned matching see - through underwear , and had to look away from the overly erotic sight before i lost it . \\n▁ the second we had successfully pulled her jeans off of her , her hands came up to mine . \\n▁ i was so ready for her , that the feeling of the tips of her fingers brushing against me through the denim fabric made me suck in a quick breath and mutter her name . \\n▁ she rolled me to my back as she unzipped them and slid them down . \\n▁ i lifted my h * ps so she could get them off and she kissed the tip of me , through the fabric of my boxer - briefs . \\n▁ i gasped and stilled my h * ps to keep myself from coming . \\n▁ not noticing what that nearly did to me , she pulled my jeans all the way off . \\n▁ not wanting to completely lose it if she did that again , i slipped my boxers off while her back was turned , occupied with dropping my jeans to the floor . \\n▁ when she swiveled back , her eyes widened as she took in the nak * d sight of me . \\n▁ i flushed as her eyes stayed focused on my erection . \\n▁ nerves suddenly tightened my stomach at what we were going to do , what i was finally going to do . \\n▁ maybe darren was right , maybe i 'd built sex up too much in my head . \\n▁ now the expectation of it was sort of squashing me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m nervous , '' i whispered . \\n▁ her eyes immediately flew to my face and her brow scrunched slightly as a hand reached out to cup my face . \\n▁ ` ` why ? \\n▁ it 's just me . '' \\n▁ she smiled encouragingly , like those words would help me . \\n▁ i swallowed and shook my head , sitting up on an elbow beside her . \\n▁ ` ` exactly … it 's you . '' \\n▁ i sighed and ran a hand down her arm , my eyes tracking the movement . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want to disappoint you , '' i whispered . \\n▁ the hand on my cheek moved to under my chin , lifting me and making me look at her . \\n▁ ` ` you … could never disappoint me , lucas . \\n▁ never . '' \\n▁ i started to protest , but she quickly leaned over and kissed me , cutting off my words . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not feeling overly confident about myself either , you know . \\n▁ i mean , the last guy i was with rated me a three . '' \\n▁ i shook my head but she quickly cut me off again . \\n▁ ` ` but i ' ve always felt comfortable being with you , and i know this will be perfect … because it 's you and me . \\n▁ that 's all that matters , that 's all that 's ever mattered … you and me . '' \\n▁ i sighed and let her deepen the kiss ; draw me into her mouth , into her passion as we lay side - by - side . \\n▁ i wanted to believe her . \\n▁ i wanted to believe i would n't mess this up . \\n▁ possibly still feeling my tension , she ran her lips to my ear and huskily whispered , ` ` just tell me what you need … and i 'll do it . '' \\n▁ the answer slipped out of my mouth before any conscious thought was put into it . \\n▁ ` ` i just want you to touch me , '' i whispered . \\n▁ she groaned at my words and slipped her hands down my sides , running them along my hips . \\n▁ i started to move on top of her when she slipped her hands under her own underwear and slipped them off . \\n▁ i paused , taking in the entire effect of this beautiful , nak * d woman lying on my bed … for me . \\n▁ my breath spiked and a sharp ache went straight through me . \\n▁ with my eyes never leaving her sensuous body , i watched the way she slid her hands over herself , along her curves , over her hip bones , across her stomach . \\n▁ i again began to move over her , needing to be with her , and was again distracted by her hand , dipping down to her inner thigh . \\n▁ my mouth dropped open as she ran a finger along her own wetness , a sharp gasp leaving her lips as she swept one digit and then another through the moisture , collecting some on the tips . \\n▁ i bit my lip , praying that this sight did n't cause me to come before she 'd even touched me . \\n▁ she breathed lightly on my cheek as i watched her fingers intently . \\n▁ she pushed two of them all the way inside herself and i heard a groan escape me . \\n▁ she pulled them out and i could see the dampness of her arousal shine in the fading sunlight filtering in the room . \\n▁ my breath increased dramatically and i was n't sure how much more of this i could take . \\n▁ just when i was sure i was as hard as it was humanly possible to get , her damp fingers touched the tip of me and i stiffened even more . \\n▁ i cried out and closed my eyes as she spread her moisture over the head , gently coating the length of me . \\n▁ i felt her lips press against mine at the same time that her thumb swept a circle over the top of me . \\n▁ i tried not to , but a deep groan followed by a quick inhale through my teeth , escaped my lips . \\n▁ i automatically deepened the kiss , matching her intensity and breath as her hand ran down the length of me , squeezing at the base before running back up to sweep her thumb over the top . \\n▁ i moaned in a near whimpering way at the electricity coursing through me , and hearing gentle words of encouragement , i moved my h * ps against her hand . \\n▁ i groaned louder , sucking on her bottom lip as her hand made a continuous loop - up , over , down and back up . \\n▁ she squeezed me harder and i pressed harder with my hips , loving the feeling of sliding through her slick fingers , imaging we were already joined together . \\n▁ i relaxed into the rhythm of her hand and my h * ps and all nerves vanished with the rightness of the movement . \\n▁ our lips never stopping , our breath only increasing , sawyer took her free hand and with a gentle prodding , urged me to finally move myself directly on top of her . \\n▁ still pumping gently into her hand held in - between us , the very tip of me started grazing over the wetness of her , over and over . \\n▁ she groaned and rocked her h * ps whenever i touched her , and i rocked faster to touch her more often . \\n▁ i felt a wonderful tension building and knew i was getting dangerously close . \\n▁ i panicked for a moment , suddenly worried that i 'd lose it all over her body . \\n▁ but it was approaching fast , closer and closer with every thrust , and eventually i stopped worrying about it , and heard sawyer 's name pass my lips with a ` ` more '' and ` ` yes '' , followed close behind . \\n▁ my forehead rocked against hers , my breath fast pants that matched hers , as my hands dug into her shoulders . \\n▁ just as i felt my stomach clench with the start of my release , her hand let go of me and her other hand stilled my hips . \\n▁ the feeling immediately faded from me and a disappointed whimper escaped my lips before i could stop it . \\n▁ her lips came to mine , kissing me softly , bringing me down a little with soothing touches and soft words . \\n▁ her gentle kisses traveled to my ear , where she very gently said , ` ` it 's okay , lucas . \\n▁ this will be better … i promise . '' \\n▁ i dropped my head to her neck and moaned softly . \\n▁ with that , she adjusted her legs wider and guided the head of me , to the entrance of her . \\n▁ as her wet warmness called to me , i ached with the need to plunge deep inside her . \\n▁ i stopped myself though and lifted my head to gaze at the pale , gray eyes looking back at me so lovingly . \\n▁ ` ` this means everything to me , sawyer . \\n▁ you mean everything . \\n▁ i love you . '' \\n▁ her eyes misted over as her hand urged me inside of her . \\n▁ i gasped as the tip of me slid in and she pulled her hand away . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , luc , '' she whispered , as she pulled my h * ps to her , sinking me all of the way inside of her with a deep moan . \\n▁ i was overwhelmed as she took me in , inch - by - inch , until our h * ps rested flush together . \\n▁ she conformed to me , like she was made … just for me . \\n▁ i could n't do anything . \\n▁ i could n't breathe , could n't move . \\n▁ all i could do was lie there and try to absorb the fact that i was within her - we were one . \\n▁ ` ` move in me , lucas . '' \\n▁ her sweet voice awoke me from my over - stimulated state and i inhaled a deep , steadying breath . \\n▁ slowly , i moved my h * ps back and then equally as slow , forward again . \\n▁ i will never , no matter how many more times in my life that i do this , forget that first thrust . \\n▁ it was electric . \\n▁ it was earth shattering . \\n▁ it was exquisite pleasure , made all the more so because i was experiencing it with her . \\n▁ it started at the very tip of me and shot all the way back through my body in shuddering waves . \\n▁ i cried out with the ecstasy of it and dropped my head to her shoulder . \\n▁ her hands came up to cradle me , and our h * ps started a slow , easy rhythm - neither one of us wanting to rush this moment . \\n▁ i sort of felt like i should be doing something more for her - touching her , kissing her or whispering words of undying love , but i found that all i could do , was keep my head buried in her shoulder , making near whimpering noises as explosive new feelings and sensations rocketed through me . \\n▁ even though i knew this was n't her first time , like it was mine , there were enough moans and general sounds of approval passing her lips that i believed , whatever i was doing , was enough for her . \\n▁ of their own accord , our h * ps started rocking together faster and my whimpering changed to some sort of uncontrollable groaning . \\n▁ i felt that unbearably wonderful tension building in me again , but stronger than i 'd ever felt before . \\n▁ it started somewhere in my abdomen and throbbed outward down the length of me buried deep inside her . \\n▁ the need to relieve that wonderful pressure was so incredibly strong that i grabbed her h * ps and started thrusting in her hard and deep . \\n▁ i gasped at the sensation and muttered incoherent words of ` ` more '' and ` ` harder '' . \\n▁ it was working , the buildup was coming . \\n▁ as i drove faster into her , her murmurs of pleasure turned into outright cries of ecstasy as she met me thrust for thrust . \\n▁ as i panted with pure need , she threw her head back and cried out my name . \\n▁ i sat up slightly to watch her , her black hair spread out over my white pillows , her chest heaving with her exertion , her pale eyes closed . \\n▁ it was the most beautiful thing i 'd ever seen . \\n▁ and then i felt it - i felt the walls of her tighten hard around me , squeezing me in the most intense and erotic way . \\n▁ i ' m pretty sure an , ` ` oh my god , sawyer , '' fell from my lips before my stomach clenched and i started coming inside her , pulsing repeatedly with an xxunk i 'd never felt before . \\n▁ she gasped and pulled my head tight to her neck while i groaned , as our h * ps slowed to gentle rocking . \\n▁ i tenderly kissed her neck , her cheek , her lips , and then i carefully pulled out of her . \\n▁ gently , i scooped my arms underneath her , rolling onto my back and bringing her with me . \\n▁ she laid her head on my chest as our hearts slowed in time with our breaths . \\n▁ ` ` god , lucas … i felt you . \\n▁ i felt you come in me . '' \\n▁ i kissed the top of her head and squeezed her tighter . \\n▁ ` ` i felt you too . '' \\n▁ i pulled back to look at her and she looked up , her gray eyes dancing with happiness . \\n▁ ` ` i love you so much , sawyer . \\n▁ that was … amazing . '' \\n▁ i smiled and she laughed and then kissed me softly . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i told you , you would n't disappoint . '' \\n▁ i chuckled and she ran a finger down my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , lucas … so much . '' \\n▁ she laid her head back down on my chest , snuggling her legs up close to mine . \\n▁ as a shiver went through us , i brought a blanket around our bare bodies and she burrowed even closer to me . \\n▁ closing my eyes , i let out a long exhale , reveling in the stillness that i felt . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ she whispered , breaking our silence . \\n▁ she looked back up at me , concern in her eyes . \\n▁ i knew what she meant by that question . \\n▁ she was n't asking if i was physically alright , and , i so was , she was checking on my mental state , just like she always did . \\n▁ i 'd just done something with her that i 'd always assumed i 'd do with lillian first . \\n▁ she wanted to make sure i was okay with my decision , after the fact . \\n▁ i looked away , looking inside myself . \\n▁ was i okay ? \\n▁ searching the bits and pieces of my heart and head , all i could find in me was happiness though . \\n▁ happiness , and a calm depth of peace that i 'd thought was lost forever to me . \\n▁ i turned back to her and kissed her forehead . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i ' m great . '' \\n▁ she sighed happily , placing light kisses along my chest . \\n▁ i smiled wider with each pass of her lips over my skin . \\n▁ i felt like i could stay here , nak * d in my bed with her , for days . \\n▁ i hated that we 'd eventually have to separate . \\n▁ she lifted her body up and kissed my jaw before propping her elbows on top of my chest and settling her head into her hands . \\n▁ my hands instinctively cradled her waist , holding her against my body . \\n▁ as she dropped one of her hands to lightly stroke my cheek , the scar on her other wrist was exposed . \\n▁ my eyes locked onto it , hating what she 'd done to herself , remembering what i 'd nearly done to myself . \\n▁ she noticed my gaze and spoke softly , ` ` did you know … that i did n't fail in killing myself ? '' \\n▁ my eyes went back to hers , surprised and terrified . \\n▁ her eyes flicked between mine as her hand on my cheek twisted , so her knuckles brushed my skin . \\n▁ her eyes went to the scar i knew was visible on the wrist i could n't see . \\n▁ ` ` i succeeded at my attempt . \\n▁ i died at the hospital . '' \\n▁ my hand came up from her hip to grab the fingers caressing my face . \\n▁ i kissed the knuckles , holding them to my lips as i swallowed the horrid knot in my stomach . \\n▁ i could n't imagine her gone . \\n▁ a soft smile lit her lips as her hand clenched mine , her beautiful gray eyes on our fingers . \\n▁ ` ` for a full minute , i was dead . \\n▁ but somehow , somehow they brought me back . '' \\n▁ her eyes shifted back to mine and she gave me a pointed look . \\n▁ ` ` and there is nothing quite like death , to make you reevaluate your life . \\n▁ ` ` she cocked her head to the side , her curtain of black hair brushing over my bare skin . \\n▁ ` ` and i think you get that . '' \\n▁ i pulled her hand away from my lips and twisted it around so i could fully see her scar . \\n▁ i grabbed her other wrist and brought it around to where i could see both of them in my vision together . \\n▁ her hands tensed , as she seemed a little reluctant to let me examine them so closely , but of course , she let me . \\n▁ we had no secrets anymore . \\n▁ i placed light kisses along each one , feeling the difference in the texture of her skin , where she 'd tried to sever herself from this world . \\n▁ i was so grateful she had n't been allowed to give up . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad you came back , '' i whispered . \\n▁ her hands twisted in mine to reach up and grab my cheeks . \\n▁ her eyes glassed over with moisture while she looked over my face . \\n▁ hers took on that expression that was so beyond her years , and i instantly remembered every wise word i 'd ever heard her say to me . \\n▁ i understood so much better now , how she 'd come to earn that wisdom . \\n▁ she leaned down , placing a light kiss on my lips . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad you came back too . '' \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; it had been months since i 'd seen any sort of vision of my friends . \\n▁ the dreams had stopped once my friends had painfully said goodbye to me the night of the dance , but i 'd continued having visions of memories around places that we 'd been together : darren and i at the river , sammy and i playing video games while darren napped on my couch , and lillian . \\n▁ there were so many memories of her , that for awhile , they 'd nearly assaulted me at every turn . \\n▁ sawyer helped me through the painful ones and i struggled through the happy ones . \\n▁ a part of me was having a hard time leaving this town for that very reason . \\n▁ the memories , although sometimes painful , were all i had left of them . \\n▁ when i changed towns , there 'd be nothing to remind me of them . \\n▁ i 'd lose that too . \\n▁ but … i suppose that was just a part of letting go . \\n▁ and i would n't have to give up every reminder . \\n▁ surprisingly enough , josh had called me . \\n▁ he 'd been a crying , blubbery mess , and i 'd rushed over to his house to check on him . \\n▁ i 'd actually driven my mom 's car over there , which was saying a lot about how worried i was for him . \\n▁ while i 'd driven a couple times since stealing sawyer 's car that day , it was still something that made me edgy , and i generally tried to avoid being behind the wheel . \\n▁ but josh had needed me and i 'd dropped everything to help him . \\n▁ being in the house again had hurt and i had a sudden appreciation of just how hard it was for josh . \\n▁ everything in there was the same - every picture frame , every childhood keepsake , and every accolade darren had ever won . \\n▁ it was all in the same spot they 'd been in while he was alive . \\n▁ and his room , right across from josh 's , was exactly the same , nearly a shrine of his life . \\n▁ it had even still smelled like darren when i entered the room and found josh sobbing on the floor . \\n▁ we 'd talked for hours . \\n▁ it had been the most he 'd said to me since darren had died . \\n▁ he confessed how much he 'd hated me , simply because he 'd needed someone to hate . \\n▁ it hurt too much to miss darren with no one but fate to blame . \\n▁ he had n't understood that at the time , truly believing that i 'd been careless and gotten behind the wheel drunk , with friends who 'd been reluctant to join me . \\n▁ apparently , brittany had been very convincing when he 'd talked to her at his brother 's funeral . \\n▁ i cringed that she 'd taken that painful moment to twist josh against me . \\n▁ she really was a manipulative , vindictive little bitch . \\n▁ he 'd told me that he 'd heard about the sheriff and my mom while listening to some waitresses talk at the diner , and had figured brittany 's story of witnessing me drinking at the party was true , and my connections had let me get away with killing them all . \\n▁ i assured him it was n't like that and he said he knew that now . \\n▁ that mrs . ryans was helping him see that he 'd been transferring his grief into anger and using the swirling gossip to fuel it . \\n▁ but it was all just a distraction , so he would n't have to deal . \\n▁ now that he had to deal , he was struggling with it . \\n▁ i told him that i struggled too , but we could lean on each other . \\n▁ he 'd agreed and we 'd started meeting up after that . \\n▁ it brought me comfort that i could maybe mend the rift between darren 's family and myself . \\n▁ his parents were still distant from me , neither condemning nor supporting , but i felt like i could somewhat reconnect with his little brother , and that brightened my spirits considerably . \\n▁ mom was equally eager and resistant to see me go . \\n▁ a part of her did n't want to let her baby out of her sight , especially with the tumultuous last year that i 'd had . \\n▁ i think it was only the fact that i was leaving with sawyer that made her okay with it . \\n▁ those two had bonded in a way that almost overshadowed how my mom had bonded with lillian . \\n▁ sawyer saved my life . \\n▁ sawyer was practically a godsend to my mom . \\n▁ and to me too . \\n▁ but mom was also nearly giddy for me to leave . \\n▁ that fact was mainly because she was preparing to move in with her boyfriend . \\n▁ a few weeks ago , his wife 's health had taken a turn for the worst . \\n▁ he had stayed with her at the hospital , right up until the very end , offering the friendly comfort and companionship that a lifetime of marriage had afforded them . \\n▁ it was bittersweet for me , maybe for mom too . \\n▁ she 'd finally get to have the relationship she 'd wanted with him for years , but at a heavy price . \\n▁ the sheriff had been understandably sad after his wife 's passing , plagued with guilt and remorse and an underlying joy that he could move forward with my mom now , or so he confessed to me one night as we sat together on my couch , watching a baseball game . \\n▁ during that conversation , he confessed that he 'd decided to not charge me with anything that fateful night , partly because of my mom ; he did n't want her hating him . \\n▁ then he 'd turned on his cushion and given me a hard , steely look . \\n▁ ` ` but more than that , lucas … i did n't want to punish you farther . '' \\n▁ he looked away from me and his voice softened . \\n▁ ` ` when i told you at the hospital that they were gone … when you completely lost it … that 's when i decided to not charge you with anything . '' \\n▁ my mouth had dropped open at that and i 'd tried to respond with something coherent , but could n't . \\n▁ he looked back at my floundering face and then nodded , a small smile on his lips . \\n▁ ` ` so , do n't blame your mom for that . \\n▁ it was me . '' \\n▁ he sighed heavily and dropped his head . \\n▁ ` ` there was nothing i could legally do , to punish you any more viciously than how you 'd already been punished . '' \\n▁ he looked up and i swallowed and nodded . \\n▁ his brow furrowed and he twisted his lips . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry if that decision caused you more problems . \\n▁ i understand that some people were upset that you did n't get in trouble ? '' \\n▁ i hung my head and sighed . \\n▁ ` ` yeah … some . '' \\n▁ his hand came up to my shoulder and i looked back at him , at this stern but caring man who would probably be my stepfather one day . \\n▁ ` ` i am sorry for that , lucas . \\n▁ i was trying to make things better for you . \\n▁ i guess i did n't . '' \\n▁ i stared at him for several seconds before answering . \\n▁ ` ` you did help . \\n▁ i do n't think i could have dealt with anything … more than what i had to . '' \\n▁ i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` so , thank you . '' \\n▁ he nodded , his eyes just slightly wetter than usual . \\n▁ with a chuckle , he slung his arm over my shoulder and pulled me into a quick side hug . \\n▁ my mom came across us like that and i thought she was going to start bawling right on the spot . \\n▁ she had desperately wanted her boys to be friends and could n't be more thrilled at seeing it start to happen . \\n▁ and it was , in a way . \\n▁ being around him still brought that horrid accident to my mind , but the longer i spent with him , the more new memories started forming over those painful ones . \\n▁ i 'd never forget my friends , or that night , but i felt positive that memories of my mom snuggling with him on the couch , the sheriff and i tossing a ball in the backyard , and all of us laughing together over the antics of the local town crazy , who had wandered down main street buck - naked -lrb- and , i was really glad to not have turned into that sort of nut job -rrb- , made me begin to believe that we could be a family together , a happy one even . \\n▁ so with excitement and trepidation , i got ready to graduate from this small school of mine . \\n▁ walking down the halls on my last official day there , i could n't help the tears that sprang to my eyes . \\n▁ i thankfully did n't start crying as i went about my last day , but it did affect me . \\n▁ i was tied to this school in a more emotional way than i 'd realized on my first day back from the crash . \\n▁ this school was such a big part of the friendships and loves that i 'd formed . \\n▁ a part of me struggled with letting that go . \\n▁ ` ` you alright ? '' \\n▁ sawyer asked as she reached down and clasped my hand with hers , letting our fingers weave together , as she preferred . \\n▁ her hair was pulled into adorably cute pigtails , the same way she 'd styled it on our first day together . \\n▁ i smiled softly at her question as we walked to the cafeteria , on our way to have lunch with randy and sally , who were giving each other light pecks of affection as they walked in front of us . \\n▁ i watched the large linebacker and the plump , frizzy - haired girl who 'd stolen his heart and my smile widened . \\n▁ life could certainly surprise you sometimes . \\n▁ i 'd never have pictured those two together at the beginning of the year . \\n▁ looking down at the gray - eyed angel gazing up at me with open adoration , xxunk those thoughts . \\n▁ i 'd never have believed on that first day , that i could feel the way i did when i looked at her , when i made love to her . \\n▁ i 'd never have imagined that feelings that strong were even possible , outside of sappy romance novels . \\n▁ leaning down to brush her lips with mine , i smiled against her mouth . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m wonderful . '' \\n▁ my free hand reached up to stroke one of the long tails of her hair and i had a brief ` school girl ' fantasy flash through my head as i pulled away . \\n▁ my smile widened . \\n▁ she looked doubtful though as she searched my eyes , and i sighed contently and shook my head at her boundless concern . \\n▁ my eyes flicked over the loud , boisterous cafeteria as we entered it . \\n▁ some of the students looked up when i entered , some smiled and shot me a wave . \\n▁ some looked at me blankly for a moment before returning to their conversations . \\n▁ josh met my gaze while i waited in line with sawyer , deciding to splurge on our last day with some hot food that i 'd heard was nearly edible and vaguely resembled pizza . \\n▁ he gave me a polite nod before he went back to what looked like an argument with the girlfriend he always seemed to be in a tiff with . \\n▁ some of the students snacking on their midday meals had spilled out into the warm air of the sunny , near - summer day and we decided to join them , picking a vacant spot under a shady tree . \\n▁ even though sawyer and i were dressed in typical summer garb , shorts and light t - shirts , her shirt was still long - sleeved , and she still played with those sleeves on occasion , stretching out the fabric with her habit . \\n▁ i knew now why she dressed that way , and as we held hands while sitting in the grass , my thumb came up to sweep the scar at her wrist . \\n▁ she did n't flinch anymore when i did that , completely comfortable now with me exploring her body . \\n▁ besides , i think she understood that i did that as a silent thanks to the heavens for keeping her here … for me . \\n▁ my eyes drifted over the familiar buildings and memories of my friends assaulted me . \\n▁ i drew them to me , absorbing them , never wanting to forget a moment that i 'd spent here with them . \\n▁ i felt a chin rest on my shoulder and i pulled out of my thoughts to gaze down at sawyer sitting close by my side . \\n▁ ` ` you sure you 're okay ? \\n▁ you seem a little … down . '' \\n▁ she kissed my shoulder and then rested her cheek upon it . \\n▁ i kissed her forehead and allowed myself a sad smile . \\n▁ ` ` i guess i ' m just … reminiscing . '' \\n▁ she lifted her head and held my gaze . \\n▁ ` ` about lillian . '' \\n▁ she said it calmly , but i knew enough about her to know that a trace of sadness was there , buried deep under the surface . \\n▁ she knew that what she and i had , went way beyond what lil and i had ever shared together , but she also knew that lil would never leave my heart . \\n▁ unlike an ex that i had simply drifted apart from , lil had died , and in the middle of our love affair . \\n▁ and a part of me , a miniscule part of me , would always be in love with her . \\n▁ i kissed her head again and shook mine . \\n▁ ` ` no , not just lil . '' \\n▁ my eyes swept over the campus again . \\n▁ ` ` all of them . \\n▁ i feel like once i leave here … i ' m leaving them all behind , for good . '' \\n▁ her hand came up to touch my cheek and i looked back at her . \\n▁ i blinked when i realized my vision was watery and i could n't see her clearly . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ guess i was going to start crying today . \\n▁ she brushed one tear that had managed to escape away before our lunch mates saw it . \\n▁ her gaze softened as she watched the emotions slide across my face . \\n▁ she nodded and looked thoughtful for a moment . \\n▁ ` ` do you want to talk about it ? '' \\n▁ her eyes swept over the campus before returning to mine . \\n▁ ` ` it will help you to remember , if you say it out loud . '' \\n▁ i smiled and nodded . \\n▁ i looked down , gathering myself , and then started telling her every moment i remembered with them . \\n▁ i was a little surprised at how easy it was to talk about them now , but months of counseling had taught me to open up , and nobody on this earth made me more comfortable than sawyer , so opening up to her was particularly easy , especially now that we were so close . \\n▁ some of the memories i had were hard , and my eyes watered again , but with no more tears falling , luckily . \\n▁ some memories were humorous and we both shared some good laughs . \\n▁ sawyer held my hand and listened with rapt attention while i told her stories about people she 'd never gotten the chance to meet . \\n▁ it made me a little sad that she never had ; she would have loved my friends . \\n▁ but then … if she had , our relationship would be completely different . \\n▁ eventually randy and sally interjected with some stories of their own and i listened intently at hearing tales of my friends through other people 's eyes . \\n▁ eventually after that , a small circle had formed around us , of more people sharing their recollections . \\n▁ more tears sprang to my eyes as i listened to others share their memories . \\n▁ it lifted my heart at hearing how deeply my friends were missed , and not just by me . \\n▁ it lifted my heart that they would never be forgotten . \\n▁ as the small circle , that was starting to feel like a group therapy session , widened and the stories grew more joyous , i noticed josh on the outskirts , listening . \\n▁ i motioned to him with my finger , but he shook his head and stayed where he was , yards away from the happy remembrances , but still absorbing them . \\n▁ i understood . \\n▁ even in the midst of all the warmth i felt from the group , a part of me felt alone and sad . \\n▁ a part of me wanted to pull away and retreat into my shell , but i knew that would n't do me any good , so i stayed . \\n▁ i stayed and listened and even contributed with stories of my own . \\n▁ by the time people started heading off to class and it was just sawyer and i , enjoying our free period in the sun , i felt like the memories were molded and encased in plaster - never to escape my head . \\n▁ that evening , sawyer came to my house , all decked out in a beautiful lavender dress . \\n▁ her super black hair had the front layers pulled back into a simple clip , exposing her long elegant neck . \\n▁ as i told her she looked amazing and pressed that silky material to my body , my fingers sliding easily along her contours , my head rewound itself to our last encounter , and the sounds she 'd made when my lips had traveled over that smooth skin , the rapid pulse of her heart evident as my tongue had swept tiny circles along the artery of that slim neck . \\n▁ her eyes smoldered as they met mine and i thought maybe my steamy thoughts were apparent on my face . \\n▁ either that , or she liked the black slacks and the crisp , dark blue shirt that i was wearing -lrb- complete with a tie this time -rrb- , and was having steamy thoughts of her own . \\n▁ i hoped her thoughts were in line with mine again . \\n▁ her fingers slid down that tie , trailing down my chest as well , as she looked over my more orderly than usual , styled hair . \\n▁ she bit her lip and brought her attention to my hazel eyes , eyes that i imagined had to be smoldering right back at her . \\n▁ ` ` you look great , '' she whispered . \\n▁ i smiled and pulled her even tighter , wishing my mom was n't in the house getting ready for the graduation ceremony , wishing we had more time before we had to leave for that ceremony … wishing i could rip her clothes off right here . \\n▁ well , maybe tonight … afterwards ? \\n▁ now that we were hav * * g s * x on a regular basis , i found myself wanting it all the time . \\n▁ luckily , sawyer had an appetite that matched my own . \\n▁ we were well on our way to rivaling darren and sammy 's weekly average . \\n▁ her eyes dragged over my body and i felt the heat of that stare even through my clothes . \\n▁ my body started reacting to her , to the curves of her body , emphasized in that satin material , to her fingers exploring my chest muscles , and to her eyes mentally undressing me . \\n▁ just as i was about to pull the telltale sign of my arousal away from her , she pressed her h * ps into me and i groaned . \\n▁ she reached up to kiss me , a playful smile on her lips and lust clear in her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i wish we had more time , '' she whispered as we kissed fiercely , her words again matching my thoughts as we stood clenched together , still standing just a few feet from the front door . \\n▁ she had n't made it very far before our hormones had taken over . \\n▁ i started to back her into that door , not much caring anymore that my mom was in her bedroom . \\n▁ she gasped as i pressed against her , and i felt myself getting harder . \\n▁ my lips traveled down to her neck , back to that artery , where her heart was racing again . \\n▁ ` ` you are driving me crazy … i want you . '' \\n▁ she groaned after i said that and her hands ran down to my ass , pulling my h * ps and grinding me into her . \\n▁ i groaned and started to run through places in my head where we could go and my mom would n't interrupt us . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … is that sawyer ? \\n▁ are you guys ready ? '' \\n▁ ` ` god , yes … '' i heard myself mutter lowly . \\n▁ sawyer started laughing and i tore myself away from her body , laughing as well now . \\n▁ as we stepped away from each other , i tossed an answer to my mom 's creepily well - timed question over my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` yes , mom , sawyer 's here . '' \\n▁ shaking my head , i twisted back to face her . \\n▁ she was still braced against the door , still laughing , her cheeks flushed from embarrassment and desire . \\n▁ my body twitched and i sighed , knowing i had to wait for that wonderful connection . \\n▁ my smile turned into a wry one . \\n▁ ` ` when are we leaving for college again ? '' \\n▁ she giggled more and reached out for my hand . \\n▁ i grabbed it and together we headed over to the couch so my body could calm down a bit before my mom stepped into the room . \\n▁ i looked over at her as we sat . \\n▁ ` ` needless to say … i really like your dress . '' \\n▁ she rolled her eyes and laughed again . \\n▁ ` ` i should have remembered that dresses are your achilles ' heel . '' \\n▁ she raised an eyebrow at that and i smirked at her comment . \\n▁ my gaze went to the space above the television set . \\n▁ the wall there had been empty for a long time , but mom had slowly started putting up pictures of sawyer and me . \\n▁ amongst the random everyday shots , was the picture that had been taken of us at the winter dance . \\n▁ in it , sawyer was gazing up at me and i was gazing right back down at her . \\n▁ even from the profile of our faces , the look of love passing between us was unmistakable . \\n▁ the photographer had been right when he 'd assured me that it was perfect . \\n▁ right beside that picture , was one that had been taken a few weeks ago at senior prom . \\n▁ sawyer 's mom had gone behind her dad 's back and splurged on a magnificently fitted , long - sleeved dress . \\n▁ it had been low cut with a high slit up one leg . \\n▁ in a midnight - black shade that had beautifully matched her hair , the tight gown had also showed off every curve of her body . \\n▁ mine had really liked that . \\n▁ we 'd barely made it through half of that dance before our overly aroused bodies had needed a change of locale . \\n▁ sawyer was right … i did have a thing for her in sexy dresses . \\n▁ we were both chuckling about it when my mom finally joined us . \\n▁ she was wearing a summery dress with large flowers printed on it . \\n▁ she had left her hair down , curling it into large waves that nearly hid the gray streaks . \\n▁ with a beaming smile on her face as she looked over the two of us holding hands on the couch , i thought she looked half her age . \\n▁ i smiled at her youthful enthusiasm for the potentially boring event tonight . \\n▁ she crossed over in front of the couch and grabbed a smooth strand of sawyer 's hair . \\n▁ her eyes watered as she looked over my girlfriend . \\n▁ i chuckled lightly that she was nearly crying already ; she 'd be bawling long before i was actually handed my diploma . \\n▁ her hand trailed down the satin covering sawyer 's arms , down to her wrists . \\n▁ she grabbed sawyer 's fingers and squeezed for a second while sawyer smiled up at her . \\n▁ ` ` sawyer , honey , you 're so beautiful . \\n▁ that dress is lovely . '' \\n▁ mom turned to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` is n't she lovely , lucas ? '' \\n▁ i blushed slightly and sawyer giggled at seeing it . \\n▁ we both knew what i ` ` thought '' of her dress . \\n▁ ` ` yes , mom , she 's beautiful . '' \\n▁ i whispered that last part directly at sawyer and her cheeks flushed to a blush more perfect than any brand name makeup could hope to mimic . \\n▁ mom patted my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` you 're very handsome as well , lucas . \\n▁ i swear you look more like your father every day . '' \\n▁ i looked back up at her when she said that . \\n▁ we did n't often speak of my dad , or ever speak of him really . \\n▁ her smile was a sad one , and i was n't sure if i wanted to look more and more like my father every day . \\n▁ her melancholy almost instantly shifted back to radiance . \\n▁ ` ` neil will be here in a minute and then we 'll go . '' \\n▁ she took a seat in the chair next to the couch and demurely crossed her ankles , her face dreamy at the mention of her boyfriend . \\n▁ she looked down and bit her lip . \\n▁ ` ` um , i wo n't be back after the ceremony , lucas . '' \\n▁ she peeked up at me and i swear she was blushing . \\n▁ finally she raised her chin and gave me a level gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to stay overnight with neil . '' \\n▁ i had no idea what to say to that . \\n▁ on the one hand , i had accepted their relationship and i was thrilled that she was happy . \\n▁ on the other … my mom had pretty much just told me she was hav * * g s * x tonight . \\n▁ my stomach twisted a little bit as i flatly said , ` ` alright . '' \\n▁ she grinned like a school girl and sawyer chuckled beside me . \\n▁ mom shifted her focus to her . \\n▁ ` ` are your parents coming tonight , dear ? \\n▁ i 'd love to chat with your mom again . '' \\n▁ sawyer nodded . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , they 're meeting me there . \\n▁ a bunch of us senior girls are having a sleepover at sally 's house afterwards , so i ' m taking my own car . '' \\n▁ as i watched her blankly , not realizing that she 'd made plans without me , her hand subtly squeezed mine . \\n▁ as she did n't turn to look at me , i wondered over that move that was obviously meant to convey something . \\n▁ then it hit me so hard i actually groaned , quickly shifting it to a cough when my mom looked at me funny . \\n▁ sawyer had just lied . \\n▁ she had no intention of going to sally 's tonight . \\n▁ she was staying overnight … with me . \\n▁ maybe she 'd only originally planned on staying most of the night with me and then heading out to sally 's before morning , but my mom had just handed her an overnight pass . \\n▁ mom was n't coming home tonight … and sawyer was n't leaving me . \\n▁ my slacks got a little uncomfortable as i thought about that , and i squeezed her hand back much harder than she 'd squeezed mine . \\n▁ i could not concentrate on any of the conversations we had after that , while we waited for neil to show up . \\n▁ i was ready for the dressed portion of the evening to be over with . \\n▁ although , i 'd have to tell sawyer at some point to not change out of that dress after the ceremony … sheriff whitney , uh , neil , pulled into a parking space right beside the space i 'd parked sawyer 's car in . \\n▁ even though the drive to the high school was a fairly short one from my house , i exhaled with relief when i turned the key off . \\n▁ i generally let sawyer drive us everywhere , but tonight had seemed like the kind of occasion where i should be more of a gentleman and drive her . \\n▁ especially with her looking so nice in that silky dress . \\n▁ her hand came out to my knee as i watched neil get out of his car and walk over to my mom 's door , escorting her from her car just like i wanted to escort sawyer . \\n▁ maybe he felt the evening called for a little chivalry , or maybe that was just a remnant of his generation . \\n▁ that 's probably just the way things were done back in the day … he was quite a bit older than my mom . \\n▁ but if that did n't bother her , i suppose i should n't let it bother me . \\n▁ i looked back at sawyer as she squeezed my knee . \\n▁ her face had a warm smile on it and mine matched it as i gazed at her . \\n▁ ` ` you did great , luc . '' \\n▁ i knew she was talking about my driving and i felt my cheeks flush with heat , both at her encouragement and at the fact that she felt like she needed to encourage me . \\n▁ eventually i would get passed this obstacle and feel more at ease behind the wheel again . \\n▁ it was just going to take a lot longer than i 'd anticipated . \\n▁ at least i did n't get panic attacks at just the thought of getting behind the wheel anymore . \\n▁ that was something . \\n▁ i nodded at her and opened my door . \\n▁ she waited in her seat , knowing i wanted to be all grownup - like for her , and watched me walk around the car . \\n▁ i swung open her door and swiftly swept her into my arms for a quick kiss , surprising her and making her let out a short squeak . \\n▁ an unhappy grunt behind me got my attention and i twisted to look over my shoulder , immediately meeting gazes with sawyer 's intimidating father . \\n▁ it would seem they 'd also just arrived . \\n▁ he 'd gradually accepted that our purely platonic friendship had shifted to something much deeper , after that day on the highway , and while sawyer assured me that he did indeed like me , he generally did not like seeing me with my hands and mouth all over his baby girl . \\n▁ i instantly stepped away from her , not wanting to get her into any unnecessary trouble that might prevent her from spending the night with me , or with sally , as her parents believed . \\n▁ they may have accepted our relationship , but they were n't about to condone us hav * * g s * x. even if sawyer and i were both eighteen now , and technically adults , they were still parents , and much like my mom , they were most likely pretending that the two of us had decided to hold off on the physical stuff until we were away at college -lrb- if not until we were married -rrb- . \\n▁ i was n't about to let it slip to any of them that that was most definitely not the case . \\n▁ sawyer calmly walked up to her dad and slung her slim arms around his massive neck , giving him a light kiss on the cheek . \\n▁ you could see the big man practically melt as he hugged her back . \\n▁ her mom broke off from chatting with neil and my mom , and gave her daughter a warm hug when her father had let go . \\n▁ then her mom hugged me and told us she was proud of us . \\n▁ sawyer 's dad merely nodded and grunted at me again . \\n▁ walking hand in hand , sawyer and i parted ways with the parents and headed to the back of the gym , where the rest of the seniors were waiting . \\n▁ there were about eighty of us in this small school and most were having conversations with friends in groups of five or six . \\n▁ everyone was dressed semi - formally , most already wearing their graduation robes slung open over their shoulders . \\n▁ sawyer and i were handed ours by sally , who immediately started chatting with sawyer about her party . \\n▁ i had no idea if sally was aware that sawyer was n't really coming over or not . \\n▁ from the sound of it , sawyer had n't told her yet . \\n▁ as i tuned out their girl talk , i took a look around at the assembled students lounging about in the choir room , waiting for their five seconds of acknowledgement for four years of hard work . \\n▁ it was a sea of blue before me . \\n▁ blue robes and blue square hats with blue and white tassels hanging off the top . \\n▁ the room screamed school spirit and buzzed with the excited energy of people ready to leave that spirit behind . \\n▁ i looked over the faces i 'd become close with over the last couple months and gave them brief smiles when our eyes met . \\n▁ randy waved at me and i waved back . \\n▁ he was talking with some of the senior football players , will included . \\n▁ will rolled his eyes at me when mine met his , but he made no move to antagonize me . \\n▁ while we had never warmed to each other , the level of teasing had died down once i 'd started standing up to him . \\n▁ i narrowed it down to ` little man on campus ' syndrome . \\n▁ for a long time i 'd had everything he 'd wanted - a successful position as quarterback on the team and lillian firmly by my side , completely head over heels in love with me . \\n▁ seeing me fall from that , had been too tempting of a target to stroke his ego with . \\n▁ i hoped severing our friendship had been worth it to him . \\n▁ it was n't for me . \\n▁ my eyes passed over several teachers in the room , ms . reynolds and mr . varner among them . \\n▁ oddly enough , they were talking closely together and i watched as his hand brushed against her thigh suggestively . \\n▁ i grimaced at the thought of her dating that jerk . \\n▁ after everything she 'd done for me this year , i felt a little protective of her , and hated for her to end up with that a * * hole . \\n▁ as she brushed his fingers away , i smiled wryly . \\n▁ maybe she was well aware of his nature and could see past the face that drove the high school girls to distraction . \\n▁ good . \\n▁ i 'd rather see her with a man who looked like a troll , than a man who actually was one . \\n▁ with irritation on his face , mr . varner 's eyes slid over to mine . \\n▁ they narrowed when they took me in . \\n▁ i knew i 'd been staring at him with an expression that probably looked smug , and i did n't change that expression as i continued to stare at him . \\n▁ the guy was a jerk and deserved to be shot down . \\n▁ he broke our eye contact , rolling his and walking away from ms . reynolds . \\n▁ her perky , pixie cut hair turned to look over at me and her beautiful smile widened . \\n▁ now that i knew the bloodline , i thought i could see the resemblance to sawyer in the shape of her eyes and the color of her brown hair , that more matched sawyer 's mom , since sawyer dyed hers . \\n▁ the body was also a pretty close match as the skirt ms . reynolds was wearing clung to her thighs and the flowery blouse plunged deep to show her cl * * vage . \\n▁ after a brief smile and nod to her , i turned to take in the other students , needing all references to sawyer 's body out of my head . \\n▁ as i started to space out , staring at the sea of blue and white , i suddenly clearly saw darren , sammy and lil , all in their gowns , and talking with each other with mile wide grins . \\n▁ envisioning them like that had n't happened in weeks , and i smiled , welcoming it . \\n▁ especially today . \\n▁ darren looked over at me and waved with a playful glint in his dark eyes , his dark hair , in typical disarray , seemingly emphasizing his xxunk . \\n▁ i grinned as i imagined that darren would have had some prank planned for his brief moment of fame . \\n▁ knowing darren , he 'd have gone up on stage only wearing boxers under that robe and he 'd have taken that moment to flash the crowd to thunderous applause from the student body . \\n▁ my gaze shifted to the imagined version of sammy holding darren 's hand . \\n▁ she 'd of thought that was hilarious and would have been hollering the loudest of anyone for him . \\n▁ his antics never really made her angry . \\n▁ irritated sometimes , sure , but never angry . \\n▁ she very rarely had anything but a happy grin on her face and my vision of her right now was no different . \\n▁ she turned her auburn head to say something to lillian standing next to her and my gaze shifted as well . \\n▁ a twang went through me . \\n▁ that probably would n't ever stop when i pictured her , but the ache was a dull one as she met my gaze and smiled at me . \\n▁ a sad smile was on my face as i imagined that if last year had n't happened , last year to this exact date , i 'd be standing over there with them , laughing about all the trouble we 'd caused in our last year and planning to go out with a bang before we separated for colleges . \\n▁ i swallowed harshly and my hands clenched involuntarily . \\n▁ ` ` hey . '' \\n▁ a soft voice beside me broke my vision and i blinked several times before looking down at sawyer beside me . \\n▁ i knew my eyes were wet as she looked up at me . \\n▁ ` ` you okay ? '' \\n▁ she lightly shook our joined hands and i relaxed my death grip on her . \\n▁ i nodded , but then stopped and shook my head . \\n▁ with a slight lift of my lip i shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` it was today . '' \\n▁ she nodded and leaned against me , understanding what i meant . \\n▁ the accident had happened today . \\n▁ i swallowed and continued , ` ` i would never have imagined a year ago , that i 'd be graduating today without them … '' my voice trailed off as my throat closed up . \\n▁ sawyer 's eyes watered and she nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` they 'd be so proud of you , luc . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes at that and nodded . \\n▁ yes , they would . \\n▁ they 'd be thrilled that i 'd survived the year , survived the torment and whispers and the , at times , self - inflicted pain . \\n▁ they 'd be proud that i was moving forward . \\n▁ they 'd be joyous that i had a potentially great life ahead of me , with a pretty amazing girl beside me , and even though i wished with every speck of life inside my body that they 'd survived too , i was proud of them . \\n▁ proud that i 'd known them , proud that i 'd loved them and proud that they 'd loved me too . \\n▁ proud that we 'd had the kind of friendship together that some people went their whole lives without experiencing . \\n▁ and i 'd hold that to me … forever . \\n▁ eventually mr . varner and ms . reynolds organized us into a few long alphabetized lines . \\n▁ being the only ` w ' in my class , i was in the back of the last line . \\n▁ sawyer looked back at me from farther up our line and smiled brilliantly , the tassel on her hat swishing as she turned her head . \\n▁ she mouthed ' i love you ' and twisted back around before i could say anything back . \\n▁ i smiled as i watched her talk to sally standing in the line right next to her . \\n▁ ms . reynolds came down each line , congratulating the seniors . \\n▁ she stopped in front of sawyer and gave her a few words , her eyes glistening as she beamed at her relative . \\n▁ they shared a swift hug and then ms . reynolds continued down the line to me . \\n▁ she shook her head as she stood in front of me and i knew she had a ton of things she wanted to say to me . \\n▁ i could imagine them : you ' ve come a long way , i ' m glad the safe and sound club was a help to you , i ' m sorry i ever doubted your innocence , i ' m here if you need me . \\n▁ all she ended up saying was , ` ` i ' m proud of you , lucas . '' \\n▁ i grinned as i watched her move back up to the front of the line . \\n▁ that was enough . \\n▁ she opened up the door and headed out to the gym . \\n▁ with a look of utter boredom on his model face , mr . varner told the assembled kids that it was time to get this over with . \\n▁ he flung his hand towards the open door ms . reynolds had just walked through . \\n▁ when the first girl in line , abby adams , did n't move fast enough , he started making a ` get a move on ' gesture with his hand , continually spinning it in a circle while the line eventually trudged forward . \\n▁ mr . varner was either irritated that he 'd been put on senior duty , or was irritated that ms . reynolds had shot him down . \\n▁ i was hoping it was the latter , but really , just his being irritated was fine with me . \\n▁ he had a hopelessly exasperated look on his face by the time i got to him and i gave him a brief smile . \\n▁ he glared and put a hand on my shoulder , holding me back from the rest . \\n▁ his eyes searched my face . \\n▁ ` ` you sober ? \\n▁ i do n't need you up there slowing things down . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes and jerked away from his touch . \\n▁ here was one person who was going to think the worst of me no matter what . \\n▁ i tried not to take that personally when i thought back over his sour mood all year . \\n▁ he just did n't care much for kids , it was n't necessarily about me , although , i was pretty sure he disliked me more than the rest . \\n▁ i seriously had no idea how i 'd managed to get an a out of his class . \\n▁ i raised my chin as i held his gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't drink . '' \\n▁ my eyes flicked out the now empty doorframe and then back to him . \\n▁ ` ` and i have no intention of holding up your … plans , jonathan . '' \\n▁ i could n't help my impish grin ; i was pretty sure his ` ` plans '' were n't the ones he wanted . \\n▁ he narrowed his eyes even more and shoved my back to get me walking again . \\n▁ ` ` you 're already holding up my plans , '' i heard him mutter as i stepped out into the lacquered floor of the gym . \\n▁ once again , i thought mr . varner had chosen the wrong path in life . \\n▁ i blinked as i stepped out into the comparatively brighter room , and paused a second to take in the sea of faces in the bleachers . \\n▁ several younger members of the student body were there , saying goodbye to their older friends , and i recognized several parents of the kids in my class . \\n▁ as i was standing alone by the choir room door , several heads in the bleachers turned to look at me . \\n▁ i was suddenly reminded of the packed gym laughing at me as i stumbled around like an idiot , doped out of my head , back near the beginning of the school year . \\n▁ i was pretty sure this crowd would n't start laughing , jeering or throwing rotten tomatoes at me , but the scrutiny was making my cheeks heat . \\n▁ i hurried to the last row of folding chairs set up before a makeshift stage in the center of the gym floor . \\n▁ the kids in my row were almost all seated by the time i scurried over to them . \\n▁ i sat down on the edge and looked over my row of blue - clad peers to find sawyer , who was leaning forward in her seat and looking back at me . \\n▁ her head was cocked and her brow furrowed ; she obviously was wondering why i 'd been late . \\n▁ i smiled at how much she worried over me and shook my head at her , wanting her to enjoy her moment , her accomplishments , and for once , put my heart aside , if only for a few moments . \\n▁ i settled back in my seat while the robed students in front of me shifted , preparing for a least an hour of tedium . \\n▁ i looked behind me at the students and parents watching their loved ones , looking for my mom . \\n▁ i found her right away . \\n▁ she was sitting almost directly behind me in the center of the bottom section of bleachers . \\n▁ she was sitting in - between sawyer 's mom and neil , but she was n't looking my way , she was bent down in conversation with someone sitting in front of her . \\n▁ my eyes widened when i realized who she was talking too . \\n▁ i do n't think i could have been more surprised . \\n▁ she was talking to josh . \\n▁ i was n't sure what startled me more , the fact that she was actually having what looked like a serious conversation with him , a hand supportively on his shoulder , or the fact that he 'd actually come to the ceremony . \\n▁ he had no real reason to be here . \\n▁ i mean , he had a few friends in the class , but he was probably going to see them at some after party anyway . \\n▁ why sit through the pomp and circumstance if you did n't have to ? \\n▁ they finished their conversation , my mom leaning down to give him a swift hug . \\n▁ i remembered then , that my mom did n't know all of the things josh had said and done to me over the year . \\n▁ all she knew , was that he was darren 's little brother , and that he was probably as broken up over the loss as i was . \\n▁ i was instantly glad that i 'd never told her about any of his torments . \\n▁ he may have been an ass to me , but he deserved my mother 's kindness . \\n▁ even if he had implied that she was a whore . \\n▁ josh , looking a little uncomfortable , loosely returned her hug and then nodded politely at neil before twisting around to face front again . \\n▁ i could hear the principal start the ceremony and the room quiet down as people turned to listen . \\n▁ i ignored it and kept my gaze on josh . \\n▁ he stared right back at me , his face blank . \\n▁ finally , one edge of his lip lifted to a smile . \\n▁ i smiled at seeing it , figuring that was the best i was going to get . \\n▁ it was something though , and much better than him flinging a rock at me . \\n▁ i twisted around to listen to the monotonous tones of the principal as she went about her xxunk speech . \\n▁ i spaced out as her level voice lulled me into a semi - conscious state . \\n▁ i thought about the year and everything that had happened . \\n▁ i thought about the people i loved now and the people i 'd loved then . \\n▁ i thought about my friends and how they should be here for this . \\n▁ ms . reynolds had confessed that the school had agonized over what to do for them . \\n▁ some members of the faculty had wanted to have a memorial during the ceremony , showing slides of them and having some students give speeches . \\n▁ my stomach had twisted at the thought of having to sit through that . \\n▁ i was n't sure if i could , even after all this time . \\n▁ some other teachers had wanted to only do a symbolic memorial , saving empty seats and acknowledging their names in the correct places among the other students , pointing them out , but not dwelling on the tragedy . \\n▁ i thought that would have been a really decent thing to do . \\n▁ but , a few of the more vocal teachers , and i ' m assuming mr . varner was among these , had raised quite a ruckus over the whole thing , insisting that there had been memorials over the summer and the students had had the entire year with a grief counselor on staff to deal with their pain . \\n▁ they felt that graduation should only celebrate the accomplishments of the living , and the dead should n't be brought up during such a joyous time . \\n▁ i had been really offended by that . \\n▁ especially since i was pretty sure that the teachers complaining just wanted to speed up the whole ordeal so their summers could start already . \\n▁ unfortunately , the principal had agreed with the louder faculty members and nothing was being done . \\n▁ on the anniversary of my friends ' tragic deaths , nothing was being done to honor them . \\n▁ the longer i sat in my hard backed chair , the longer that thought did n't sit well with me . \\n▁ they were people , people i loved dearly . \\n▁ not ` ` events '' that could be tossed aside because bringing them up might make some people uncomfortable . \\n▁ i knew it would be hard for me to hear their names and be reminded of their absence , but it was their right . \\n▁ they 'd struggled through years of learning . \\n▁ they 'd all been decent , if not good students . \\n▁ they 'd all participated in the extra circular activities and had been active members of the community . \\n▁ they 'd all been loved . \\n▁ they would have graduated , with honors , if their lives had continued normally . \\n▁ well , darren would have just squeaked by , but i ' m positive he would have graduated . \\n▁ they deserved better than being swept under the rug . \\n▁ they deserved their recognition . \\n▁ &lt; br / &gt; i closed my eyes and sighed , wishing i did n't have to do this . \\n▁ wishing my friends were sitting in their seats , laughing at me making a spectacle of myself . \\n▁ but wishing changes nothing and this was my reality , a reality i needed to share tonight . \\n▁ ` ` darren , lil and sammy were drinking … darren was very drunk . \\n▁ i 'd been drinking soda , so i took the keys from him . '' \\n▁ i looked up and out at the crowd . \\n▁ silence had hit the gym again upon my words and i found an odd sort of strength from that . \\n▁ i 'd been sort of worried that some xxunk would have stood up and started verbally abusing me at that point , but everyone was still seated , listening . \\n▁ ` ` the wreck was n't caused because i 'd been … messed up . '' \\n▁ i closed my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` it was that freak rainstorm . \\n▁ we hit it on the way home and darren 's car started xxunk on the road . '' \\n▁ i paused , feeling the slice of pain that always hit me at this point . \\n▁ i reopened my eyes and searched the audience until i connected with my mother 's . \\n▁ i focused on the love i felt pouring from her and in a much quieter voice , continued . \\n▁ ` ` i made a mistake . \\n▁ i was driving too fast and all i wanted was to stop … so i slammed on the brakes . \\n▁ i completely lost control of the car and we were right at that sharp corner . \\n▁ i could n't do anything to stop us and we hit the rail hard … and went over . '' \\n▁ i kept my eyes on my mom 's , tears streaming down her cheeks as she started to lightly cry . \\n▁ my voice cracked when it started again . \\n▁ ` ` i made a mistake … and they all died because of it . '' \\n▁ i looked back over the crowd and saw several faces with unshed tears and several more with wet cheeks . \\n▁ i was a little startled to realize that mine were wet as well . \\n▁ ` ` they were my best friends and i miss them every day , and i know several of you feel the same way . '' \\n▁ i let my eyes drift back down to the seniors before me . \\n▁ ` ` they would have loved to be here , graduating with us today . '' \\n▁ i swallowed noisily . \\n▁ ` ` i would give anything to be able to go back to that night a year ago , knowing what i know today , and change everything that happened . \\n▁ i 'd leave earlier , or drive slower , or make us all walk home even . '' \\n▁ i sighed , knowing that once again , wishing did nothing . \\n▁ ` ` no … i 'd convince them all not to go in the first place . \\n▁ i 'd convince them to stay at my place and stay safe . \\n▁ i know i ca n't go back and change anything , but , i 'd give anything to have my friends … our friends back . '' \\n▁ i sniffed and searched the thoughtful eyes of the students in front of me , most of them in tears . \\n▁ i stopped when my eyes came upon sawyer 's again . \\n▁ hers were as wet as mine as she nodded her encouragement . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve thought of joining them so many times . \\n▁ i thought everyone 's life would be better if i 'd never survived , if i was dead as well . \\n▁ and i wanted to die . \\n▁ i tried to … die with them . '' \\n▁ i looked back at my mom 's face and registered the pale whiteness as her mind went back to that awful day by the highway , when i 'd been set on taking my own life . \\n▁ i swallowed and spoke directly at her . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted to make everyone 's life easier . \\n▁ i wanted my torture to end . '' \\n▁ i cocked my head as i watched her start to sob quietly in the stands . \\n▁ neil put a comforting hand across her shoulders and pulled her to his side . \\n▁ sawyer 's parents , their faces as wet and distraught as my mom 's , patted her back in sympathy . \\n▁ my eyes drifted from her down to josh . \\n▁ he was staring at me wide - eyed with his mouth open . \\n▁ he had n't known that i 'd actually gone from wanting to die , to trying to make it happen . \\n▁ with a small voice i spoke to him . \\n▁ ` ` but i ca n't change the past and i have to live with what i ' ve done . \\n▁ and i will . '' \\n▁ peeling my eyes away from josh 's stricken face and my mom 's pain , i inhaled a deep , cleansing breath and swept the room again . \\n▁ ` ` if some of you still choose to believe the lies , and still choose to hate me … i wo n't hold that against you . '' \\n▁ i set my jaw and raised my chin . \\n▁ ` ` but , i wo n't be joining you in hating me anymore . \\n▁ i made a mistake , a mistake that anyone could have made . '' \\n▁ my voice and face softened and i looked down and lightly shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve taken my penance , and now … i ' m moving forward . \\n▁ now , i 'll do what darren , sammy and lillian would have wanted me to do . '' \\n▁ i looked back up , my eyes automatically going to sawyer 's beaming face . \\n▁ ` ` now , i 'll live . '' \\n▁ i stepped away from the podium and blinked a few times while i looked around . \\n▁ there was no stoic clapping like you 'd expect after a speech like that , just a few sniffles and a few muttered words , and a sea of appraising , thoughtful faces . \\n▁ i was n't sure if my speech had changed anyone 's feelings about me - those who still believed the worst , after all this time , would probably always believe the worst , but i 'd needed to do it and as i stepped down to rejoin my classmates , i felt a calm peace flowing through me that i had . \\n▁ the principal quickly wrapped up the evening and then the entire gym erupted in celebration . \\n▁ i joined in . \\n▁ i 'd done it . \\n▁ i 'd made it through the year in more or less one piece . \\n▁ as the crowd of graduated students began to disperse , i found sawyer and lifted her about a foot in the air . \\n▁ she squealed and hugged me tight , whispering how proud of me she was for my speech . \\n▁ i set her down and grabbed her face , giving her a long , slow kiss that did n't end until some of the students around us started clapping our backs to congratulate us . \\n▁ many more people gave me approving words for my silent tribute to our lost classmates than i 'd thought would . \\n▁ ms . reynolds came up to me with tears on her cheeks , telling me my speech was beautiful . \\n▁ mrs . xxunk approached me a minute later , making sawyer laugh when she called me tom . \\n▁ at hearing xxunk ' voice , she 'd turned to acknowledge her and blinked , shaking her head , like she was looking at something that could n't be real . \\n▁ sawyer looked at her oddly , but i understood my flighty teacher 's reaction . \\n▁ mrs . xxunk probably thought she was seeing art come to life right in front of her face . \\n▁ i 'd drawn and painted and sculpted various versions of sawyer all year , and even though mrs . xxunk had talked to sawyer at the beginning of the school year , when sawyer had been collecting homework assignments for me , i do n't think she 'd realized that my subject was an actual person until this very second . \\n▁ as i watched my odd teacher recover herself and turn to float among the seniors , a hand clapped my back . \\n▁ i twisted to see coach standing behind me . \\n▁ i blinked and shook my head , like i was seeing something that could n't be real . \\n▁ coach had actual tears in his eyes . \\n▁ with pride clear on his face , he clapped my shoulder and drew me in for a swift hug . \\n▁ that startled me too . \\n▁ quickly letting go , he crossed his arms over his chest and leaned back , appraising me . \\n▁ ` ` that was nice , luc … what you did . '' \\n▁ he lightly shook his head and gruffly said , ` ` stupid principal should have done it . '' \\n▁ i lightly smiled at that and nodded my agreement . \\n▁ he sniffed again , his eyes getting even xxunk . \\n▁ extending his hand to me , he spoke in a genuinely heartfelt voice , ` ` you 're a good man , lucas . \\n▁ it 's been an honor knowing you . '' \\n▁ my eyes misted as well as i grabbed his hand and shook it . \\n▁ ` ` you too , coach . '' \\n▁ i heard sawyer beside me sniffle and i put my arm around her waist as coach and i released each other . \\n▁ she laid her head on my shoulder as i smiled at the much softer looking coach in front of me . \\n▁ for once , we felt more like equals than a teacher and a student . \\n▁ i suppose that was a natural feeling to have after graduating though . \\n▁ he clasped my shoulder again , turning like he was leaving . \\n▁ ` ` coach ? '' \\n▁ i said as he twisted . \\n▁ he looked back at me with raised eyebrows and i again saw the resemblance to me that darren used to tease me constantly about . \\n▁ one day i 'd have to ask mom if we were related . \\n▁ maybe distant cousins or something ? \\n▁ ` ` thank you , for your help with college . '' \\n▁ he smirked and shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` that was all you , lucas . '' \\n▁ abruptly his face got that stern ` ` coach '' look that he could do so well . \\n▁ ` ` but do n't make me look bad in front of my sister 's husband . '' \\n▁ i smiled and shook my head as he walked off . \\n▁ several students came up to sawyer and me after that , offering congratulations and xxunk for my speech . \\n▁ even will came up to me and grudgingly told me that my moment of silence was a nice thing to do . \\n▁ of course , then he tried to make me fall as sawyer and i headed for the bleachers to rejoin our parents . \\n▁ it was n't as if will had instantly grown up since being handed an honorific piece of paper . \\n▁ shaking my head at his weak attempt , i clasped sawyer 's hand and we headed over to where her parents were animatedly talking with my mom and neil . \\n▁ sawyer 's mom had wet cheeks and her face beamed when she glanced at me . \\n▁ i suddenly had the thought that she 'd finally seen me as a potential husband for her daughter tonight , and she approved . \\n▁ i could n't help but smile at that thought . \\n▁ just as we took the first step to climb up to them , josh stepped down to stand in front of me . \\n▁ his face was tired and currently blank , but his dark eyes looked like they 'd been wrung out a couple times . \\n▁ i motioned for sawyer to go ahead , telling her i 'd be there in a minute . \\n▁ she nodded and squeezed my hand before letting go . \\n▁ josh 's eyes watched her leave before slowly turning back to mine . \\n▁ i swallowed , waiting for him to speak to me . \\n▁ after another couple seconds of silence , he finally did . \\n▁ ` ` that was really nice … what you did for darren , for all of them . \\n▁ thank you . '' \\n▁ i felt my eyes watering and did n't know what to say in return . \\n▁ i felt myself nodding and saying , ` ` they deserved some recognition … especially today . '' \\n▁ my voice was soft and a touch hoarse . \\n▁ josh 's eyes watered as well and he clapped me on the shoulder before twisting to walk past me on the stairs . \\n▁ i turned to watch him leave , mentally wishing him a happier year next year . \\n▁ once on the gym floor , he turned to look back at me . \\n▁ his eyes studied mine for a moment before he nodded and quietly said , ` ` i believe you , lucas . \\n▁ good luck next year . '' \\n▁ those damn tears in my eyes trailed down my cheeks as i nodded and told him my earlier silent well wishes out loud . \\n▁ he nodded back to me , and then turned and disappeared into the sea of robed students and their parents milling about the gym floor . \\n▁ after congratulatory hugs from sawyer 's mom and surprisingly , her dad as well , i was engulfed by my mother , who sobbed and told me repeatedly that she loved me and was very proud of me . \\n▁ i tried to pull away from her near hysterics , but then i stopped and let the slight woman cry on my shoulder as long as she needed to . \\n▁ i 'd done something to her when i 'd tried to stop my life and this was her way of healing . \\n▁ i would n't deny her that . \\n▁ when she was finally more put together , neil gave me a swift hug and a handshake , and took her hand , leading her from the gym , back to his home , where they were probably going to make love all evening . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and shook my head after having that thought . \\n▁ i said goodbye to sawyer 's parents , who had a word with sally before leaving the gym and heading home alone . \\n▁ by the look on their faces as they waved at the door , sally had convinced them that sawyer was indeed going to her party . \\n▁ i gave her a sly smile as i realized why she had n't broken the news to her friend yet . \\n▁ she gave me a wry smile back , her adorable dimple smiling at me too . \\n▁ ` ` sally is an awful liar . \\n▁ now that she 's convinced my parents that i ' m really going to be at her house all night , i ' m pretty much free until morning , '' she explained . \\n▁ giving me a quick kiss she added , ` ` i ' m going to go tell her what 's really up . '' \\n▁ i smiled as she pulled away , but then frowned . \\n▁ ` ` do your parents still not trust you ? '' \\n▁ she laughed and stepped back into me , her arms going around my neck as she leaned up for a kiss . \\n▁ ` ` they trust me fine . \\n▁ but you ? \\n▁ they 're pretty sure you would use any opportunity to get into my pants . '' \\n▁ she laughed again and i laughed with her . \\n▁ my hands ran around her waist , imagining that dress again . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not getting into your pants that 's interesting me right now . '' \\n▁ i cupped her backside through her robe and she giggled . \\n▁ leaning in close i added , ` ` you are going to keep that dress on for awhile longer … right ? '' \\n▁ she laughed again , giving me another light kiss before disentangling us . \\n▁ ` ` oh yes , luc . \\n▁ i was n't about to change something that makes your eyes look like that . '' \\n▁ she walked away then , to go talk to sally , and i furrowed my brow . \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ i called across the gym to her . \\n▁ she turned her head and laughed , but did n't answer me . \\n▁ i grinned as i watched my beautiful girl walk over to her friend to break the news . \\n▁ sorry sally , tonight my angel is staying with me . \\n▁ i loved that thought . \\n▁ walking hand in hand with sawyer to the parking lot , i started gearing myself up for the drive back home . \\n▁ i knew i could do it , but i still had to give myself a mental pep talk . \\n▁ i waved at various groups of people that we walked past , a little amazed at how different things were now , than at the beginning of the year . \\n▁ i 'd made it , though . \\n▁ as hard as it had been , it was over now . \\n▁ i clenched sawyer 's hand as we reached the first parked cars . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ? '' \\n▁ a voice calling to me got sawyer 's and my attention and we stopped walking and turned to look behind us . \\n▁ i smiled brightly at seeing beth come trotting over to greet us . \\n▁ her red curls bounced around her shoulders as the wide smile on her face matched mine . \\n▁ ` ` good , you 're still here . '' \\n▁ ` ` hi , beth , '' i said , releasing sawyer 's hand so i could give her a warm hug . \\n▁ she returned it , her hands coming down to my arms as we pulled apart . \\n▁ pride showed in her pale eyes as she looked over my face . \\n▁ ` ` that was amazing , lucas , just … amazing . '' \\n▁ i blushed and looked down . \\n▁ it was n't that incredible . \\n▁ she laughed and i looked back up at her . \\n▁ ` ` no , i ' m not exaggerating . \\n▁ considering where you started this year , that , '' she indicated behind her with her head , ` ` was amazing . '' \\n▁ i smiled and shook my head . \\n▁ my face getting serious on me , i looked over hers . \\n▁ ` ` thank you … for not giving up on me . '' \\n▁ i raised one lip wryly . \\n▁ ` ` or having me committed . '' \\n▁ she laughed again and shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd never have done either of those things , lucas . '' \\n▁ she patted my arm , looking over to sawyer before turning back to me . \\n▁ ` ` you call me if you need … anything , okay ? '' \\n▁ i nodded again and gave her another swift hug . \\n▁ in my ear she whispered , ` ` i told you we 'd get you there , luc . '' \\n▁ i bit my lip and nodded as we separated a final time . \\n▁ i grabbed sawyer 's hand and turned with her to leave . \\n▁ as we did , beth knowingly said , ` ` have a good night you two . '' \\n▁ sawyer giggled and i turned my head to look back at beth , giving her a quick grin . \\n▁ i could still hear her light laughter when we reached sawyer 's car . \\n▁ it felt like just moments later that sawyer and i were standing alone in my bedroom . \\n▁ the room was subtly lit by the half moon hanging thousands of miles above us and the intimacy of its pale light wrapped around us . \\n▁ we stood by the side of my bed and simply gazed at each other . \\n▁ my heart warmed at the sight of her silver - in - the - moonlight eyes drinking me in . \\n▁ i sighed and lowered my head to hers , giving her a soft kiss , filling it with every ounce of love that i felt for her . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , '' i whispered between our kiss , feeling the need to verbalize what i felt for her too . \\n▁ she sighed with a sound that matched mine , her lips equally as soft and filled with love . \\n▁ her hands came up to my face , one stopping at my cheek , the other tangling in my hair . \\n▁ the move brought her body closer to mine and her br * * sts pressed against my chest . \\n▁ i could feel the rigid peaks of her n * * ples pressing through her silky dress and a moan escaped me . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , '' she whispered . \\n▁ my hands came up to rest on her hips , our lips moving more intently now . \\n▁ as my hands circled her backside , she made a soft noise and stepped into me , her h * ps resting against mine . \\n▁ i was hard , ready for her and i heard an , ` ` oh , lucas , '' fall from her lips before my tongue stole all speech from her . \\n▁ my fingers lightly traveled up her slightly trembling body to her neck , threading through some long , silky strands of her hair before finding the zipper of that fabulous dress . \\n▁ i groaned as i pulled the zipper down , anxious to see what was underneath and sorry to see that thin , clingy material leave her curves . \\n▁ i pulled back , my breath coming harder through my parted lips . \\n▁ hers was as well . \\n▁ pulling the now gray looking dress down her shoulders , i exposed her creamy skin inch - by - inch . \\n▁ she gasped when her shoulders were free . \\n▁ i gasped when her br * * sts were free . \\n▁ following that silky fabric down the contours of her body , i shoved it to a point just past her hips , and then dropped it . \\n▁ it fell to her feet in a loose pile and i took a second to admire the scantily clad beauty before me . \\n▁ her bra and underwear were a startling white . \\n▁ they had to be , for they seemed to glow in the pale light of the moon . \\n▁ they were lacey and provocative , barely containing her curves , her br * * sts nearly spilling out of the partial cups . \\n▁ my head bent to automatically taste the tender skin above her breast while my fingers wrapped around to unveil them . \\n▁ her fingers loosened my tie and started making short work of the buttons on my shirt as i unclasped her bra . \\n▁ she pulled me over to my bed , stepping out of her shoes and the pile of her dress . \\n▁ i kicked off my shoes as i followed her , my head still bent , my mouth and tongue rolling over her exposed n * * ples . \\n▁ she pulled off my tie and shirt when the backs of her legs hit the bed . \\n▁ she started in on my slacks when i moved over to the other breast . \\n▁ i was barely conscious of my pants sliding down my legs , my whole being focused on feeling her body . \\n▁ it was n't until her hand wrapped around me that i became aware of my body again . \\n▁ i groaned and found my way back to her mouth . \\n▁ our kisses were more passionate now , as our fingers and palms explored the other . \\n▁ our breaths nearly as frantic as our mouths , she pulled my neck , urging me to lie down with her . \\n▁ i did , pausing only momentarily to slip off my socks and underwear . \\n▁ she watched me with hungry eyes until i joined her again . \\n▁ i laid on top of her , pressing my achingly hard arousal against her underwear . \\n▁ i could feel how ready she was for me too and i swore under my breath . \\n▁ she grinded her h * ps against me and a low swear passed from her lips as well . \\n▁ i trailed my mouth and tongue down her body , wanting to know what every part of her tasted like . \\n▁ every section was different : the trace amount of flowery perfume along her neck , the barest hint of sweat between her br * * sts , the faint amount of lavender body wash around her belly button . \\n▁ my fingers looped around her underwear , and tugged them down . \\n▁ as i watched them slide down her thighs , the only thought in my head was - i needed to taste her everywhere . \\n▁ i threw them over my shoulder and let my hands travel back up her thighs , pushing them apart as i kissed along the inside . \\n▁ i heard her breath hitch in anticipation . \\n▁ it made me throb . \\n▁ i stared at the spot i wanted to be inside more than anything . \\n▁ she was drenched for me and her h * ps squirmed in my hands . \\n▁ i knew she wanted me to be inside her too . \\n▁ and i would be … in a minute . \\n▁ just as i was bringing my tongue down to taste that moisture , her hands pushed back on my shoulders . \\n▁ my breath was heavy and my eyes felt hooded as i snapped them up to hers ; hers were heavy with desire too as she looked down on me , but i could also see a hint of uncertainty . \\n▁ sawyer and i were completely comfortable with each other , but this … ? \\n▁ for her , this was probably more intimate than everything we 'd already done . \\n▁ for me too , i suppose . \\n▁ if our positions were reversed , i 'd probably be feeling a little self - conscious about myself , regardless of how comfortable i was with her . \\n▁ even boundless love did n't always overcome insecurity . \\n▁ i understood that . \\n▁ truth be told , i was a little nervous about this too , as i 'd never done it either , but i wanted us to experience everything together , even if it kind of scared us . \\n▁ she apparently felt the same . \\n▁ after staring down at me for just a moment , she bit her lip , and then reached over to cup my cheek , her thumb ring , the only adornment on her body , cool on my warm skin . \\n▁ she drew me right to her center and relaxed her legs , opening herself to me ; welcoming me as she always did . \\n▁ i did n't hesitate . \\n▁ i dropped my mouth to that delicate skin and ran my tongue along the core of her . \\n▁ i heard the groan i made , but i was instantly drowned out by the loud cry from her . \\n▁ her h * ps bucked underneath me and i steadied her , not nearly done yet . \\n▁ i stroked and sucked and enjoyed every drop of her desire for me . \\n▁ her hand threaded through my hair as her h * ps started a rhythm with my tongue . \\n▁ the taste … was indescribable . \\n▁ ` ` lucas … that feels so … '' she started panting and moaning in a pattern i knew well and i ached with the thought of making her come this way . \\n▁ just when i started to wonder if i could , her need - filled voice rang in my ears . \\n▁ ` ` oh god , oh god , lucas … i ' m … i ' m … '' she did n't even have time to say it , as i 'd slipped a couple fingers inside of her and she 'd instantly come around me . \\n▁ i moaned as i felt and heard and tasted her orgasm . \\n▁ i was so in tune with her body , it was almost like i was her and i 'd just come as well , even though my throbbing body assured me that i had n't . \\n▁ i pulled away , breathless and aching . \\n▁ she reached down for my face and pulled me to her mouth . \\n▁ we both moaned together at her taste between us . \\n▁ needing her so bad i could barely take it anymore , i slid into her and cried out in her mouth when our h * ps rested together . \\n▁ we stayed connected , without moving , until my body calmed down a bit . \\n▁ then we slowly began pulling apart and coming together . \\n▁ we both exhaled in relief as i filled her and she enveloped me . \\n▁ it was the most intensely profound connection i 'd ever had , emotionally or physically , with another human being . \\n▁ our movements stayed slow and unhurried as we experienced the other in the silvery near - dark of my bedroom . \\n▁ i whispered in her ear how much i loved her and she murmured that she loved me in return . \\n▁ we rocked together in complete unison , feeling like we 'd done this for years instead of months . \\n▁ eventually our joint need drove us to move faster and faster , until i felt all of my other senses dulling , as my body focused on one outcome . \\n▁ i heard myself moaning and heard her beg for me to come in her . \\n▁ i did n't need to be told twice . \\n▁ with a few more deep thrusts , i started to come , crying her name as i spilled inside her . \\n▁ she clutched me tight and i surprisingly heard her cry out again , coming again . \\n▁ we slowed our movements and i carefully started to remove myself from her . \\n▁ her fingers went to my hips , stilling me . \\n▁ ` ` no … please , stay , just for a little bit . '' \\n▁ i left myself inside of her , and let the rest of me carefully sag on top of her . \\n▁ ` ` as long as you want , sawyer , '' i murmured breathlessly . \\n▁ her hands came up to my back , tracing light patterns into my skin , as her legs wrapped around me , almost trying to pull me even closer , and , we could n't get any closer . \\n▁ she brought her hands up to hold my head as i lay across her , my breath still fast , my heart still racing . \\n▁ her fingers tugged through my hair , stroking repeatedly , and my body slowly started calming down . \\n▁ she kissed my head as i buried it in her neck . \\n▁ when i felt a wetness on my cheek , i pulled back , confused . \\n▁ looking up at her face , i noticed that she was lightly crying . \\n▁ i immediately pulled out of her and adjusted some of my body weight off of her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , am i hurting you ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , wiping tears off her cheeks . \\n▁ she looked up at the ceiling , shaking her head and looking embarrassed as she swallowed and swiped some fingers under her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` no , no of course not . '' \\n▁ still confused , i scrunched my brow and swept my hands over her face , not wanting her to feel anything but happy , like me . \\n▁ seeing my face , she sighed and rolled her eyes , a slight laugh escaping her . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , i ' m totally being a girl right now . '' \\n▁ ` ` sawyer ? '' \\n▁ she brought her hands to my cheeks , soothing my fears with a warm smile . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry . \\n▁ it 's just … with everything we ' ve both gone through … '' she sighed and searched my face , new tears moistening her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` this is overwhelming , what i feel for you … and sometimes … '' her voice warbled , but she swallowed and steadied herself . \\n▁ with a clearer voice she said , ` ` sometimes , i ca n't believe we made it here … together . '' \\n▁ i sighed and rested my head on hers . \\n▁ ` ` i know exactly what you mean , '' i whispered , rocking my head against hers and kissing her tenderly for a few minutes , enjoying seeing her as overwhelmed as i sometimes felt . \\n▁ when i pulled away , she bit her lip . \\n▁ ` ` i have a confession . '' \\n▁ i cocked an eyebrow at her . \\n▁ she grinned devilishly before answering me . \\n▁ ` ` while that was … amazing , lucas , sex really was n't why i wanted to stay with you tonight . '' \\n▁ i lifted my head and shifted to her side . \\n▁ she twisted to face me , her legs entangling with mine . \\n▁ ` ` no ? '' \\n▁ i said distractedly , as i ran my fingers through her hair . \\n▁ she bit her lip again and shook her head , her eyes darting down to my chest , before lifting to meet mine again . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ her hand came up to cup my cheek , stroking soft circles into my skin . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted to make sure you were okay tonight … in case it was difficult for you . \\n▁ in case you had a dream . '' \\n▁ i stopped stroking her hair as i started understanding what she meant . \\n▁ she 'd planned on staying with me tonight , because it was the one year anniversary of my friends ' deaths . \\n▁ she was worried i 'd have a nightmare and wake up screaming … alone . \\n▁ and she did n't want me to be alone ; she never wanted me to be alone . \\n▁ i sighed and lightly shook my head , amazed at her compassion . \\n▁ i leaned in to lightly kiss her . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be fine , sawyer . '' \\n▁ resting my head against hers , i whispered , ` ` but i am glad you 're here . '' \\n▁ i had n't dreamt of them in so long , that i was pretty sure i would n't tonight . \\n▁ but … you never know . \\n▁ i pulled her tight to me , reveling in the lemony scent of her hair as my face buried into her shoulder . \\n▁ her arms came up to rub random patterns into my back and i felt exhaustion start to take me over . \\n▁ i whispered how much i loved her , and then gave into it . \\n▁ i gradually became aware that i was back at school . \\n▁ i was in the first floor hallway of the main building . \\n▁ i looked around the empty space , and all i saw was locker upon locker . \\n▁ some were closed , some were open ; papers and books spilling out of them to the floor . \\n▁ some posters taped on the wall were torn and battered - one from the safe and sound club , wishing all the kids a ` ` safe '' summer , had been suspended over the archway leading outside , but was now ripped in two , the loose pieces hanging around the doorframe like paper curtains . \\n▁ the floor of the hall was littered with stray pieces of paper , streamers , tassels from graduation caps and scores of commencement ceremony pamphlets . \\n▁ it was like the entire student body had ripped out of here after graduation , littering and messing up the place in their joy of school being over , if only for the summer , for those not leaving these halls for good . \\n▁ the janitors were gon na be pissed . \\n▁ laughter from the opposite end of the hall got my attention , and i turned to look . \\n▁ a wide smile broke out on my face as i watched darren , sammy and lillian materialize and start to walk towards me . \\n▁ they were all wearing their caps and gowns , scrolled diplomas held tightly in sammy and lillian 's hands . \\n▁ darren , walking in the middle of the girls , was tightly holding their free hands as they all three looked at each other with bright , smiling faces . \\n▁ as one , they turned their heads to stare at me . \\n▁ every face was calm and peaceful . \\n▁ every set of eyes was warm and loving . \\n▁ mine misted over at seeing them again . \\n▁ it had been months . \\n▁ darren nodded at me , a warm grin on his face , his dark eyes glowing with the life i knew they did n't really have anymore . \\n▁ his dark hair , stuck out every which way , as untamable as himself . \\n▁ on his right , sammy beamed with a bright smile . \\n▁ her auburn hair seemed to find every ray of light in the room and glowed like an autumn sunset . \\n▁ her golden eyes regarded mine with a slight hint of moisture , and she nodded as well . \\n▁ after acknowledging her greeting , my eyes shifted to darren 's left , to the first love of my life . \\n▁ she gleamed as golden as the sun . \\n▁ her pale hair was nearly painful to look at , and her eyes were a bright blue , as perfect as a cloudless spring day . \\n▁ her smile was brilliant as she gazed at me . \\n▁ my breath caught at seeing it . \\n▁ even long deceased , her beauty still tore my heart . \\n▁ ` ` hello , lucas . '' \\n▁ her voice , so long gone from my ears , closed up my throat and i shut my eyes , absorbing that sound forever . \\n▁ after long seconds , i reopened them . \\n▁ they had all stepped closer to me during my silence and were standing in a small circle around me . \\n▁ each one reached out to touch a part of me ; sammy on the side of me , touched a shoulder , darren on the other side of me , touched my other shoulder , and lillian directly in front of me , reached up to touch my chest . \\n▁ i inhaled at the warmth and peace in their physical contact . \\n▁ much like before , they felt completely real . \\n▁ i smiled at each one in turn , my eyes lingering on lillian last . \\n▁ ` ` i never thought i 'd see you again , '' i said , when i could finally speak . \\n▁ lillian 's eyes watered and a slight frown marred her features . \\n▁ ` ` we never meant to push you over the edge , lucas '' she shook her head , her pale hair under her graduation cap brushing over her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` we only wanted to help . '' \\n▁ i felt darren 's hand on my shoulder tighten and i twisted to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , we 're sorry about being … harsh . '' \\n▁ i shook my head at them all . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not your fault . \\n▁ what i almost did … that was n't your fault . '' \\n▁ lillian 's hand came up to my cheek , drawing my eyes back to her . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't your fault either , luc . '' \\n▁ i knew what she meant . \\n▁ i knew she was now referring to the accident that had claimed them . \\n▁ i swallowed and felt the tears rise in my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` it was just an accident , lucas . \\n▁ that 's all . '' \\n▁ i swallowed again , my throat feeling raw and dry . \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ she smiled brilliantly again and i felt my heart fill at seeing the joy on her face . \\n▁ her hand patted my chest , smoothing out the plain t - shirt i was wearing . \\n▁ ` ` you seem better . '' \\n▁ she shook her head again . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't know how much peace that gives us . '' \\n▁ i looked over all of them again , seeing that peace clearly in their features . \\n▁ it was like looking at a mirror image of my soul , which i suppose every meeting with my dream friends had been - a representation of some part of my conscious that had needed to work things out , so i could eventually heal . \\n▁ ` ` i think i understand your peace perfectly . '' \\n▁ my eyes rested on hers again . \\n▁ ` ` i feel it too . '' \\n▁ almost as if on cue , lillian and sammy turned to look at darren and then took several steps away from me . \\n▁ they leaned back against the lockers and turned to talk to each other , tuning darren and i out . \\n▁ their clothes changed to basic jeans and t - shirts and for a moment , they looked exactly like i 'd expect to run across them between classes . \\n▁ the sight made me smile . \\n▁ darren bumped his fist into my shoulder and i twisted to look at him . \\n▁ he was in regular clothes now too and had a devilish grin on his face . \\n▁ i grinned at seeing it . \\n▁ looking over his shoulder at lil , he quickly turned back to me and lowered his voice . \\n▁ ` ` hey , good job on the … you know . '' \\n▁ he raised his eyebrows suggestively and i flushed , knowing he meant the end of my virginal status , that had been an ongoing joke between us . \\n▁ i slightly shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` gee , thanks . '' \\n▁ he laughed and then a more serious expression took over his face . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a man now . '' \\n▁ he barely got through saying it , before breaking out into more laughter . \\n▁ ` ` oh god , '' i sighed and shook my head , watching an oblivious lil over his shoulder . \\n▁ i suppose she knew , since they all knew what was in my head . \\n▁ i oddly did n't feel as guilty about that as i would have . \\n▁ i guess i really had moved on . \\n▁ i shifted my focus back to a still laughing darren . \\n▁ a chuckle finally escaped me as i memorized his gleeful face . \\n▁ ` ` are you done ? '' \\n▁ he clapped my shoulder and sighed contently . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i guess so . '' \\n▁ as the laughter died between us , his face got serious for real . \\n▁ ` ` she 's good for you , you know . '' \\n▁ i smiled over at him , knowing exactly who he was talking about . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i know . '' \\n▁ i thought of my physical body , bare , and securely wrapped in sawyer 's warm embrace and sighed contently . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ he glanced over his shoulder at sammy , who looked over at him and smiled the soft smile that she only ever gave him . \\n▁ he looked back at me , pure contentment on his face . \\n▁ ` ` do n't ever forget it . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i never could . '' \\n▁ he smiled and nodded and then looked down for a moment . \\n▁ when he looked back up , his eyes were moist . \\n▁ ` ` you were my best friend , lucas . '' \\n▁ he shook his head , his eyes glistening more . \\n▁ i felt mine glistening in response . \\n▁ ` ` you were my brother . '' \\n▁ his hand came up to my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , lucas . '' \\n▁ i sniffed and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , darren . \\n▁ you were my family . '' \\n▁ i gave him a firm hug , clapping him on the back as he clapped me . \\n▁ pulling apart , he jokingly slugged my shoulder and i laughed . \\n▁ smiling and stepping back he said , ` ` thank you … for being there for josh . \\n▁ i know he can be a dick , but he needs you . '' \\n▁ i nodded my head at him and smiled as i watched him walk over to lil and pick her up in a warm , friendly hug . \\n▁ as i watched lil giggle and struggle to get away , sammy was suddenly standing directly in front of me . \\n▁ ` ` lucas ! '' \\n▁ she exuberantly encased me in a hug and laughing at her display , i clenched her back just as warmly . \\n▁ she pulled back , her golden eyes taking me in , just as surely as i was taking her in . \\n▁ ` ` you are still the best , '' she beamed . \\n▁ ` ` and so are you , sammy . '' \\n▁ i shook my head , regarding my beautiful sister , by friendship , if not by blood . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know if i ever told you , but you were the sunshine in my day . \\n▁ you made everyone around you happier , just be being there . '' \\n▁ i let out a soft sigh . \\n▁ ` ` you have no idea how much i miss that . '' \\n▁ she grinned and tilted her head . \\n▁ ` ` right back at you , lucas . '' \\n▁ i shook my head at her comment and looked over her shoulder to darren , talking with lil . \\n▁ sammy turned and followed my gaze . \\n▁ ` ` be good to him , he needs you . '' \\n▁ she smiled at my words and turned back to me . \\n▁ ` ` i know … i need him too . '' \\n▁ she leaned forward and gave me a soft kiss on the cheek . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , lucas . '' \\n▁ i swallowed back the emotion in my throat and gave her a swift hug . \\n▁ ` ` i love you too , sammy . '' \\n▁ she turned from my grasp and walked across the hall to darren . \\n▁ he gave her a dazzling smile as he slung his arms around her waist and drew her into him . \\n▁ he bent down to kiss her and i smiled at seeing the love they had shared so easily in life . \\n▁ i hoped that wherever they had gone , that had followed them there . \\n▁ as i watched their tenderness , i felt a warm hand slip into mine . \\n▁ ` ` they always were good together . '' \\n▁ i looked down at lil 's golden head as she stood by my side , also watching darren and sammy . \\n▁ she looked up at me when she felt my eyes on her , a slight smile on her lips . \\n▁ ` ` so were we , '' i whispered . \\n▁ she smiled wider and rested her head on my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` you 're lucky to have her , to have someone who loves you that much . '' \\n▁ she looked up at me after she said that , moisture in her eyes as well as adoration . \\n▁ i swallowed at the remembered look of love on her face , but a slight smile came to my lips at the remembered look of love on sawyer 's face . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ my smile shifted to a frown as i turned my back on darren and sammy to focus solely on lil . \\n▁ gently grabbing her arms , i looked down on her and searched her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i loved you , lillian , i always loved you . '' \\n▁ i looked down at the ground and shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i wish i 'd told you that while you were alive . '' \\n▁ her hand came up to my chin , lifting my head so i met her eye again . \\n▁ ` ` i always knew how you felt , lucas . '' \\n▁ a brilliant smile lit her entire face . \\n▁ ` ` and i always loved you too . '' \\n▁ i sighed as i looked over her beauty , on the inside and the outside . \\n▁ as her arms went around my waist , mine went around her shoulders , drawing her in tight . \\n▁ into her hair , i told her , ` ` you will always be my first true love and i 'll never forget you or stop loving you . '' \\n▁ i kissed her head before laying my cheek on it . \\n▁ ` ` some things never stop . '' \\n▁ she shifted underneath me and i lifted my head to let her look up at me . \\n▁ her eyes were moist again . \\n▁ ` ` i feel the same , luc . \\n▁ i ' ve always felt the same . '' \\n▁ she leaned up and gave me a soft kiss and i closed my eyes , memorizing it . \\n▁ when she pulled away , she whispered , ` ` you and i will be eternally connected but … i want you to have a good life , lucas . '' \\n▁ i opened my eyes after she said that and she shook her head , a smile on her lips even as a tear rolled down her cheek . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to live and be happy … you and sawyer both . '' \\n▁ i brushed the tear away with my thumb . \\n▁ ` ` i wish you 'd known her . \\n▁ you would have really liked her . '' \\n▁ she nodded , her smile widening . \\n▁ ` ` yeah , i wish i 'd known her too . '' \\n▁ she laughed softly and my core brightened at hearing the sound ; i 'd never forget that sound . \\n▁ ` ` of course , if i 'd known her … you would n't . '' \\n▁ she gave me a twisted smile and slightly shook her head as she added , ` ` at least , not like you do now . '' \\n▁ i looked down , feeling that guilt that i had n't felt earlier , just slightly starting to creep up on me . \\n▁ being okay while talking about sex with darren was one thing , standing right in front of lil while she referenced it , quite another . \\n▁ ` ` lil … '' her hand came back up to my chin , making me stare at her again . \\n▁ ` ` do n't , luc . \\n▁ it was meant to be . \\n▁ i wanted you with her , from nearly the beginning . '' \\n▁ she gave me a pointed glance . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a reason you and i could never … go there . '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` we were n't supposed to . \\n▁ it was always supposed to be you and sawyer . '' \\n▁ she shrugged her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` you 're both alive and in love , and i do n't begrudge you for either of those things . '' \\n▁ i sighed as i looked over her clear , untroubled blue eyes . \\n▁ ` ` you 're right … you always were right . '' \\n▁ she smiled and laughed lightly again . \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ she bit her lip and tilted her head to the side . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll miss you . '' \\n▁ my arms around her shoulders tightened as i pressed her to me , nearly squeezing the non - existent life from her . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll miss you too . '' \\n▁ we held each other for long moments , while i memorized everything that i could about her : the peachy smell of her body wash , the way her pale hair caught the lights , the feel of her slender , but curvy body against mine , the way her fingers felt as she lightly rubbed them along my back . \\n▁ i inhaled deep , tucking it all away to the corner of my brain that would always belong to her . \\n▁ my eyes were wet as we pulled apart . \\n▁ i raised a corner of my lip , feeling the end of this goodbye approaching , not that i 'd say that word to any of them . \\n▁ our arms simultaneously slipped from each other 's bodies down to our hands . \\n▁ our fingers laced together as we leaned into the other , heads pressed together . \\n▁ ` ` until we meet again then ? '' \\n▁ she said quietly , feeling the approaching goodbye as well . \\n▁ i smiled and lightly nodded against her head . \\n▁ ` ` yes … whenever that may be . '' \\n▁ ` ` i hope it 's a lifetime from now , lucas . '' \\n▁ she leaned up to brush our lips together . \\n▁ i reveled in the warmth of her kiss , feeling both the love and friendship behind it . \\n▁ she met my eye when she pulled away . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll be waiting for you . '' \\n▁ as our bodies pulled apart , our fingers finally separating , darren and sammy stepped up to lillian and each took one of her hands . \\n▁ she looked at each in turn and then the three of them turned to smile at me . \\n▁ i looked at each friend , at each loved one and slowly exhaled . \\n▁ ` ` you will always be a part of me … all of you . '' \\n▁ my eyes watered uncontrollably , and the tears finally did make it down my cheeks , but my smile was exultant and the overriding emotion i felt was joy - joy that i 'd known them , joy that i 'd loved them and joy that , in my own way , i 'd always be connected to them . \\n▁ they all beamed at me , all with tears either in their eyes or in sammy 's case , dripping off her chin . \\n▁ darren sniffed and reached out to clap my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` just do n't let that part … be all of who you are . \\n▁ stay in the real world , lucas , you belong there . '' \\n▁ he nodded at me , clutching my shoulder before releasing it . \\n▁ i nodded back at him and then at each of them . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ i will . \\n▁ but i ' m keeping you all with me , '' i patted my chest , ` ` here … always . '' \\n▁ as more tears dripped off my cheeks , i slowly shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m a better person for knowing each of you . \\n▁ thank you , for the friendship you gave me . \\n▁ i 'll never forget it . '' \\n▁ we each hugged again , longer this time than before , and then darren grabbed each girl 's hand and started leading them down the hall , to the main doors highlighted in that slightly twisting paper curtain . \\n▁ i stayed standing in the same spot i 'd been before , a huge smile on my tearstained face , as in my watery vision , i watched darren sling his arms around sammy and lil 's shoulders and pull them in tight . \\n▁ he kicked at some of the papers and streamers on the floor , launching some up to land on the girls . \\n▁ they all three laughed , the sound nearly breaking my heart with the joy it gave me . \\n▁ as they reached the door , they started to fade into a sort of transparency . \\n▁ when i could just barely make out their hazy appearance , lil turned her head to me . \\n▁ over darren 's shoulder she smiled warmly , winked , and then nodded . \\n▁ i returned her warm smile and her nod , and just as they finally vaporized into the stale air of that hallway that we 'd walked countless times in real life , a warm hand grabbed mine . \\n▁ i looked down on my black - haired angel with the most beautiful shade of gray eyes . \\n▁ sawyer looked up at me with clear love and adoration on her face . \\n▁ i smiled at her and felt the familiar , calming comfort that she always gave me . \\n▁ she squeezed my hand tight and leaned into my side . \\n▁ wiping my tears dry with her fingers , she whispered , ` ` come on , lucas … it 's time to wake up now . '' \\n▁ i nodded , sighing contently , and then , for the first time since the accident that had taken my beloved friends from me … i completely woke up . \\n▁ xxrep 3 * the end xxrep 3 *</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>xxbos chapter one the selection my dress was blood red . \\n▁ this , i thought , was farcical . \\n▁ i mean blood red ? \\n▁ were they serious ? \\n▁ ` ` smile . \\n▁ be nice . \\n▁ respectful . \\n▁ always respectful . \\n▁ remember , you 're representing the xxunk , '' my mother at my side whispered urgently to me . \\n▁ her eyes did not leave the length of the hall and her bearing was stiff as we walked side - by - side . \\n▁ she was nervous and excited . \\n▁ unbearably so . \\n▁ it was driving me nuts . \\n▁ i did n't need her to say this to me . \\n▁ since i 'd received my invitation to the selection she 'd been coaxing me , coaching me and constantly reminding me that i was a buchanan and</td>\n      <td>xxbos chapter one the selection my dress was blood red . \\n▁ this , i thought , was farcical . \\n▁ i mean blood red ? \\n▁ were they serious ? \\n▁ ` ` smile . \\n▁ be nice . \\n▁ respectful . \\n▁ always respectful . \\n▁ remember , you 're representing the xxunk , '' my mother at my side whispered urgently to me . \\n▁ her eyes did not leave the length of the hall and her bearing was stiff as we walked side - by - side . \\n▁ she was nervous and excited . \\n▁ unbearably so . \\n▁ it was driving me nuts . \\n▁ i did n't need her to say this to me . \\n▁ since i 'd received my invitation to the selection she 'd been coaxing me , coaching me and constantly reminding me that i was a buchanan and what that meant . \\n▁ like i 'd ever forget . \\n▁ in fact , since i was told when i was thirteen what being a female buchanan meant , i 'd never forgotten . \\n▁ not one word . \\n▁ they were burned on my brain . \\n▁ i did n't answer her , just stared down the long hall . \\n▁ it was , as it would be , lush but spooky . \\n▁ a dark gray carpet runner flanked by polished dark wood floors . \\n▁ matching gray walls with pristine white cornices and ceilings . \\n▁ every six or seven feet a small , exquisite sconce dripping crystals was affixed to the wall , enough of them to light the way but not enough of them to take away the shadows . \\n▁ much further apart along the walls there were doors , all of them closed . \\n▁ at one end was the elevator we rode down however many stories and at the other end was the door to where we were heading . \\n▁ and in between it was a long walk . \\n▁ way too long in blood red satin shoes with a pencil thin heel and an ankle strap that was so dainty it threatened to break with every step i took . \\n▁ ` ` i think these shoes were a bad idea , '' i grumbled under my breath to my mother . \\n▁ ` ` leah … '' she started in the warning mother tone i 'd heard her use with me many a time over the years . \\n▁ ` ` no seriously , i fear a massive shoe incident . \\n▁ the xxunk ca n't have a massive shoe incident , not at something as important as a selection . \\n▁ what would that do to our reputation ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't worry about your shoes . \\n▁ your shoes will be fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i do n't think they will . \\n▁ i think we should leave , find me another pair of shoes and come back , '' i suggested . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have another pair of shoes that would be appropriate . '' \\n▁ she was right about that . \\n▁ who owned two pairs of sexy , seven hundred dollar , blood red evening shoes ? \\n▁ ` ` well then , maybe we 'll talk to the powers that be and say i could n't make it due to possible shoe failure and could i have another go at the next selection . '' \\n▁ at my words , her head whipped to face me and she looked panicked . \\n▁ this freaked me out more than i was already freaked out at the very prospect of the evening 's festivities . \\n▁ ` ` you have to attend this selection . \\n▁ for you , there is no other selection , '' she hissed , not angry . \\n▁ she was frantic . \\n▁ so frantic that out of habit , even though i did n't understand her anxiety , i found myself soothing her . \\n▁ ` ` okay , mom . \\n▁ i 'll work these shoes . \\n▁ it 'll be all right . '' \\n▁ she took in a deep breath and turned again to face the hall . \\n▁ so did i . \\n▁ that proved it . \\n▁ she 'd been beside herself with glee and , strangely , nerves when i got my invitation . \\n▁ not because everyone in my entire family thought i 'd never get an invitation to a selection -lrb- and i 'd been hoping , since i found out who my family was and what they did , that they 'd be right -rrb- but because i 'd received one to this selection . \\n▁ though she 'd never explained . \\n▁ ` ` mom , is there something … ? '' \\n▁ i did n't finish . \\n▁ we were five feet away from the door at the end of the hall . \\n▁ it opened , a man in evening dress stepped out and closed it behind him . \\n▁ i stared at him in shock . \\n▁ he had to be seven feet all , very thin , his head shiny and bald . \\n▁ he had a heavy , protruding forehead , no eyebrows , big , dark eyes and long , long limbs that matched his height . \\n▁ his hands were incredibly long and thin , longer than even his body demanded , with slender fingers and knobby knuckles . \\n▁ although he was an unusual looking man , he was somehow alluring , even handsome . \\n▁ his eyes went directly to my mother and he smiled with genuine warmth . \\n▁ he had beautiful , white , strong , even teeth . \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ was this what vampires looked like ? \\n▁ at the sight of him , my step had stuttered . \\n▁ my mother put her hand on my elbow to propel us forward the last few feet to stop in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` avery , '' she greeted and smiled up at him . \\n▁ ` ` lydia . '' \\n▁ he took her hand , bent low and brushed it against his lips . \\n▁ ` ` it 's always a pleasure , '' he went on after dropping her hand . \\n▁ ` ` i hear our lana is faring well . '' \\n▁ he knew my sister , lana . \\n▁ and he knew she was faring well . \\n▁ this was true . \\n▁ lana had been to her selection three years ago . \\n▁ she 'd been selected , according to my mother , within minutes of arrival . \\n▁ she 'd done very well for the xxunk ; a vampire of some status had chosen her . \\n▁ she was still in her arrangement with the vampire who selected her without any hint she 'd be released . \\n▁ this was unusual . \\n▁ i 'd been told after i received my invitation which heralded the time new secrets could be shared that arrangements lasted on average two to three years before the vampire released his or her concubine and moved on . \\n▁ any arrangement that lasted longer than that was known to be particularly successful . \\n▁ the buchanan women for five hundred years had made a habit of such accomplishments . \\n▁ my mother 's arrangement had lasted seven years . \\n▁ she was practically a legend . \\n▁ at least that was what my aunt millicent told me with some envy , her arrangement had lasted four and three quarter years . \\n▁ the ` ` and three quarters '' was a very important addition to aunt millicent . \\n▁ i 'd never met lana 's vampire . \\n▁ as an uninitiated , i was n't allowed . \\n▁ i did n't even know his name . \\n▁ i had seen lana countless times since her selection . \\n▁ she was ecstatically happy though she could n't tell me why , it was plain to see she was . \\n▁ ` ` and this is leah , '' avery said , his words low , giving me the strange impression there was some meaning to them outside of the fact that i was , indeed , leah . \\n▁ he 'd taken me out of my thoughts and my eyes focused on him to see he was studying me and had his large hand extended toward me , palm up . \\n▁ my mother nudged me . \\n▁ i put my hand in his and he brought it up , brushed his lips against it and then his grip tightened . \\n▁ he did n't let go as he looked in my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been looking forward to meeting you . '' \\n▁ again , there was more meaning to this . \\n▁ more than me being a buchanan , the first concubine family that put their name to the immortal and mortal agreement five hundred years ago . \\n▁ more than me being the legendary lydia 's daughter . \\n▁ more than just common courtesy . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i whispered , my voice soft and not my own mainly because he was freaking me out even more . \\n▁ he smiled at me , dropped my hand and looked at my mother . \\n▁ ` ` lucien will be very pleased . '' \\n▁ my mother dipped her head down and looked at avery under her lashes before she murmured , ` ` i hope so . '' \\n▁ what was this ? \\n▁ who was lucien and why would he be pleased ? \\n▁ ` ` who 's … ? '' \\n▁ i started but avery 's long arm swept out , cutting off my question . \\n▁ he caught both me and my mother in its length and turned . \\n▁ he opened the wide heavy door with no apparent effort and gently led us through . \\n▁ i blinked at the sudden light . \\n▁ ` ` lydia buchanan , distinguished , '' avery bellowed from behind us , ` ` and leah buchanan , uninitiated ! '' \\n▁ the soft murmur of party conversation suddenly silenced at his words . \\n▁ everyone turned to stare . \\n▁ i stared back . \\n▁ there was a lot to stare at . \\n▁ too much . \\n▁ i could n't take it all in . \\n▁ the room was oval . \\n▁ it was opulent . \\n▁ i 'd never seen anything like its simple finery . \\n▁ rich , blood red walls , again with the white cornices and ceilings , no windows as we were well below the earth 's surface . \\n▁ no paintings , no mirrors , just lots and lots of deep , blood red . \\n▁ an enormous oval chandelier illuminated the room , its millions of crystals dancing prisms of light everywhere . \\n▁ there was a plush , blood red , oval carpet on the floor that did n't reach the edges of the room and you could see the dark , gleaming wood at the sides . \\n▁ there were people there , maybe a hundred , maybe more . \\n▁ even with that many people the room was far from filled it was so large . \\n▁ everyone was wearing black , like my mother . \\n▁ the men in black evening dress with sparkling white shirts . \\n▁ the distinguished ex - concubines -lrb- or mothers , aunts or grandmothers of the uninitiated -rrb- in glamorous black gowns . \\n▁ the female vampires , appearing much younger than the males but no less elegant , also in black gowns . \\n▁ there were maybe only a dozen women wearing blood red gowns amongst the group and i noticed that my gown was different . \\n▁ this , i realized instantly , was a tactical error on my part . \\n▁ even though i was one in only a few who wore blood red , i was going to stand out . \\n▁ i did n't want to stand out . \\n▁ i did n't want to be selected . \\n▁ damn it all to hell . \\n▁ i 'd put my foot down about the gown . \\n▁ not that my mother wanted me to wear what some of the other uninitiated were wearing . \\n▁ however she 'd wanted a little more dazzle , which i thought would bring unwanted attention to myself not to mention , i was n't a dazzle type of person . \\n▁ the others had gone full on dazzle . \\n▁ unbelievable amounts of jewels at their necks , wrists , ears , elaborate up - dos with sparkling gems affixed in their hair . \\n▁ eye catching dresses from wide - skirted , southern - belle - on - a - rampage to daringly displayed skin -lrb- mostly cle * * age and lots of it -rrb- to sequined affairs that probably weighed half a ton . \\n▁ every single dress , every single jewel , every twisted curl pinned high up on someone 's head screamed pick me ! \\n▁ my dress was satin , snug - fitting at the bodice , waist and hips . \\n▁ it had a long skirt that was cut on the bias and hung beautifully when i was still and swirled softly around my legs with any movement . \\n▁ the dress bared my shoulders , had an empire waist , subtle cle * * age where the material covered my br * * sts under which it was stitched in gathers to the waistline . \\n▁ the same at the back under my shoulder blades , exposing skin at my back , around my shoulders , at my cle * * age but nothing too bold . \\n▁ i wore only the buchanan family 's ancient , hand - me - down earrings that had an oval ruby surrounded by diamonds set at the base , a larger teardrop ruby dropped from it . \\n▁ i also wore a much larger oval ruby surrounded by diamonds on my right ring finger . \\n▁ i 'd swept my blonde hair back from my face and fixed it in a twisted chignon at the nape of my neck . \\n▁ i 'd done it myself and i did n't think i did half bad . \\n▁ i looked like i was headed into a hollywood awards ceremony -lrb- at least this was what i told myself -rrb- . \\n▁ the rest of the uninitiated looked like they were no - date girls at a high school prom desperate to be asked to dance . \\n▁ ` ` crap , '' i muttered so low even my mother did n't hear me and she would have at least given me a killing look if she did . \\n▁ even so , i saw a few men , their eyes still pinned to me -lrb- in fact , everyone 's eyes were still pinned to me -rrb- smile at my word . \\n▁ as my mother propelled me down the steps with her hand again at my elbow i reminded myself that i was now amongst vampires . \\n▁ their senses were heightened to extremes . \\n▁ they could hear better , see better , their senses of smell , taste and touch were vastly more acute and they moved faster . \\n▁ or so i 'd been told . \\n▁ and , it was important to note , they did n't look like avery . \\n▁ not one of them did . \\n▁ they also did n't look like vampires . \\n▁ at least not what popular culture led us to believe was the look of vampires . \\n▁ they were not thin and pale and wearing red ribbons around their throats to which a cross was affixed . \\n▁ they also did n't have xxunk and wear rock ' n ' roll clothes . \\n▁ they were all varying heights but none of them were less than what you 'd describe as tall . \\n▁ they had varying body sizes but none of them were slight or slender , nor were they heavy or obese , they were all muscular and powerful . \\n▁ they had all different eye and hair colors . \\n▁ the vampire women were the same except the muscular part , but not the powerful part , even if this was a perceived power rather than the physical the men displayed . \\n▁ their skin was normal toned , denoting warmth , humanity . \\n▁ and , lastly , they were all beautiful . \\n▁ as we hit the bottom step , i controlled my urge to mutter a different , stronger , profanity . \\n▁ the conversation started buzzing again which was a relief because it meant i 'd stopped being the center of attention . \\n▁ this relief was short - lived . \\n▁ ` ` lydia . '' \\n▁ a man , dark blond , green - eyed , tall , gorgeous , was all of a sudden close . \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ my first close encounter with a vampire . \\n▁ ` ` cosmo , '' my mother whispered , her head tipped back , that strange , slightly sad but very familiar look she usually had in her eyes had melted away . \\n▁ instead , her eyes were alight and there was a sweet but sultry smile i 'd never seen her wear on her lips . \\n▁ he bent low and kissed the hinge of her jaw . \\n▁ something about this gesture was so intimate , i turned my eyes away . \\n▁ cosmo . \\n▁ i knew that name . \\n▁ my mother had told me the name only days before . \\n▁ my mother 's vampire . \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ ` ` cosmo , i want you to meet leah . '' \\n▁ i heard my mother say and i turned back . \\n▁ my mother was in her sixties . \\n▁ she did n't look it , nowhere near it . \\n▁ but she still looked older than cosmo who appeared to be no more than thirty - five . \\n▁ she 'd been in her twenties when she 'd serviced him . \\n▁ he moved to me and bent in . \\n▁ i froze as his lips touched the hair at my temple then his head dipped further and , mouth at my ear , he murmured , ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ a trill raced up my spine . \\n▁ it was n't exactly fear ; it was n't exactly not fear . \\n▁ nor was it unpleasant . \\n▁ not in the slightest . \\n▁ how weird . \\n▁ please , my mind begged , do n't let my mother 's vampire choose me . \\n▁ please , please , please . \\n▁ that would be both weird and gross . \\n▁ too gross . \\n▁ ick ! \\n▁ his head moved away but his body did n't . \\n▁ i found my voice and did my utmost to turn it cold and added , for good measure , an icy look on my face when i returned , ` ` cosmo . '' \\n▁ in the presence of my frost , he grinned . \\n▁ his grin made his beauty shoot off the charts . \\n▁ therefore , i lost the frost and stared . \\n▁ he turned to my mother and stated , ` ` the rumors are true . '' \\n▁ my mother shook her head , giving me a reproving look but she spoke to cosmo . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m afraid so . '' \\n▁ ` ` i like this , '' he muttered and turned to inspect my face then his green eyes moved the length of my body then back to my face before he continued , ` ` lucien will like it better . '' \\n▁ i felt my body still at another reference to the unknown lucien . \\n▁ before i could open my mouth though , my mother spoke . \\n▁ ` ` do you think so ? '' \\n▁ she asked hopefully . \\n▁ ` ` oh yes , '' cosmo answered , not taking his eyes from mine . \\n▁ ` ` who 's … ? '' \\n▁ i began but a female vampire joined our group . \\n▁ she was tall , thin but curvy , dark curling hair , beautiful blue eyes and she was wearing a strapless dress with a slit up her right leg that ended high on her hip at a graceful drape of material . \\n▁ ` ` finally . \\n▁ leah , '' she announced upon arriving at our small group . \\n▁ before anyone could say anything , she lifted a hand and snapped her fingers . \\n▁ a waiter bearing a tray of champagne flutes appeared at our sides . \\n▁ cosmo took a glass and handed it to my mother then another which he handed to me . \\n▁ as he did this the female , her gaze on me , begged cosmo , ` ` please tell me this will be interesting . '' \\n▁ cosmo , also watching me , affirmed , ` ` this will be interesting . '' \\n▁ i was losing patience . \\n▁ on any day , even a good day , i did n't tend to have a lot of patience . \\n▁ but in these extraordinary circumstances i had almost none . \\n▁ therefore this was n't a surprise . \\n▁ this meant i was also losing my temper , something which also happened easily and , unfortunately , frequently . \\n▁ ` ` can someone please tell me what everyone is talking about ? \\n▁ who 's lucien ? '' \\n▁ my voice was still cold and now also sharp . \\n▁ at my words i felt my mother turn to stone in horror at my side . \\n▁ cosmo grinned . \\n▁ the female examined me for a moment then she threw back her head and laughed . \\n▁ ` ` what 's funny ? '' \\n▁ i snapped . \\n▁ she stopped laughing but , even so , it still danced in her eyes as she replied , ` ` i ' m stephanie . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's lovely , you being stephanie and all , but that is n't an answer to my question , '' i told her . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' my mother said softly in her mother tone , this one also sounding slightly alarmed . \\n▁ ` ` leave her be , lydia , '' cosmo ordered gently . \\n▁ ` ` no harm will come to her . '' \\n▁ i felt my eyes grow wide . \\n▁ no harm would come to me ? \\n▁ what did that mean ? \\n▁ i thought this whole farce was about xxunk and civility . \\n▁ how could harm come to me ? \\n▁ other than the harm that would come to me if i was selected , of course . \\n▁ ` ` she is a buchanan , after all , '' stephanie added before i could form a question . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ there is that and , of course , lucien , '' cosmo put in and stephanie turned to him . \\n▁ ` ` where is lucien ? \\n▁ i thought he 'd never miss her arrival , '' stephanie asked cosmo . \\n▁ ` ` he 's going to be late . \\n▁ he 's having some difficulty with katrina . \\n▁ she 's … '' cosmo paused and glanced at me before looking back to stephanie , ` ` not happy about him attending this particular selection . '' \\n▁ i watched , with no small amount of unease , as stephanie 's face grew hard . \\n▁ ` ` what would she have him to do ? \\n▁ starve ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think in this instance , '' i watched cosmo 's eyes shift to me again before returning to stephanie , ` ` she would . '' \\n▁ ` ` whore , '' stephanie spat with such fierce , terrifying emotion , i could n't help myself , i stepped back . \\n▁ ` ` calm , xxunk , you 're frightening leah , '' cosmo warned . \\n▁ i felt it important to save face . \\n▁ i mean , i was frightened . \\n▁ stephanie was scaring the shit out of me , but i did n't want them to know that . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not frightened , i ' m annoyed , '' i announced . \\n▁ ` ` no one has answered my questions . '' \\n▁ cosmo 's eyes came back to me . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll get your answers soon enough , love . '' \\n▁ that did n't sound too good . \\n▁ cosmo moved to my mother and took her elbow . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get you something to eat , my love . \\n▁ i distinctly remember you like to eat . '' \\n▁ as mom moved away with cosmo i heard her reply in a voice filled with fond laughter , ` ` i remember you like the same . '' \\n▁ cosmo laughed . \\n▁ i could n't help it , i grimaced . \\n▁ i mean , even if it was my mom , it was still gross . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll like it too , '' stephanie said and my eyes shot to her . \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 'll like it too , '' she repeated . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i asked , even though i knew . \\n▁ ` ` the feeding , '' she replied . \\n▁ i did n't think so . \\n▁ ` ` i doubt it , '' i shared icily . \\n▁ she smiled , all anger out of her expression , she was back to beautiful again . \\n▁ she was also , i noted , not affected in the slightest by my icy demeanor . \\n▁ her hand darted out and her fingers closed around my upper arm with a strength that should n't have been surprising but it was . \\n▁ she led me further into the room . \\n▁ i saw and felt eyes on us as we moved . \\n▁ she stopped us close to an outer wall in a pocket where no one was near . \\n▁ she dropped my arm and took a sip of her champagne which i found shocking . \\n▁ firstly , i had n't even noticed she was carrying a glass . \\n▁ secondly , i did n't think vampires drank anything but blood . \\n▁ i took my first sip as well before asking , ` ` is no one going to explain about this lucien guy ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think we should let lucien do the explaining , '' she told me , her blue eyes on my face . \\n▁ ` ` what does he have to do with me ? '' \\n▁ i persevered . \\n▁ i was , it 's important to note , as well as impatient and short - tempered , also stubborn . \\n▁ i had a lot of bad traits . \\n▁ i knew this and i worked on it with people i cared about . \\n▁ like my mother , my sister , my aunties even though all of them drove me to distraction a great deal of the time , and especially my friends . \\n▁ i also had a lot of good traits which meant my mother , sister and aunties put up with me . \\n▁ it also meant i had a lot of friends . \\n▁ however i was n't going to show my good traits . \\n▁ not tonight . \\n▁ ` ` everything , '' stephanie responded to my question and then her head moved around sharply right before her eyes narrowed and the scary , hard look came back to her face . \\n▁ ` ` fuck , '' she hissed . \\n▁ i looked in the direction she was glaring . \\n▁ a man was approaching us . \\n▁ tall , beautiful , dark hair , swarthy skin and , strangely with his coloring , intense light gray eyes . \\n▁ he was smiling . \\n▁ at me . \\n▁ wolfishly . \\n▁ i felt another trill race up my spine . \\n▁ this one was total fear . \\n▁ complete and total fear . \\n▁ i 'd never felt anything like it and it scared the hell out of me . \\n▁ yes , this was true . \\n▁ the level of my fear scared the hell out of me . \\n▁ therefore i was doubly terrified . \\n▁ stephanie moved slightly , putting herself closer to me and partially in front of me like a shield . \\n▁ all of a sudden i decided i liked stephanie . \\n▁ the new vampire arrived at our group never taking his gaze from my face until he stopped , then it moved to my throat and i watched in horror as it turned hungry . \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ the trill up my spine chased back down . \\n▁ this time it was a chill . \\n▁ ` ` nestor , '' stephanie growled , her alto voice held a distinct unfriendly rumble . \\n▁ nestor looked to stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` a guard ? \\n▁ at a selection ? \\n▁ lucien 's being a very bad boy . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah and i are talking , '' stephanie replied . \\n▁ his lip curled as he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` you 're implying you 're considering declaring your intentions , right ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's right . \\n▁ back off , '' stephanie warned . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m supposed to believe that ? '' \\n▁ nestor clipped . \\n▁ ` ` you 're supposed to adhere to tradition , '' stephanie returned . \\n▁ ` ` i am ? \\n▁ did you release reed and i had n't heard ? '' \\n▁ nestor asked . \\n▁ ` ` back … off , '' stephanie snapped , then she tensed and i heard a feral snarl come from her throat and i looked beyond nestor . \\n▁ two more male vampires were heading our way , both big , both dark , both with dangerous intentions written clearly on their faces . \\n▁ something was not right . \\n▁ i had no idea what was going on , i just knew , whatever it was , it did n't bode well for me . \\n▁ or stephanie . \\n▁ she came closer , crowding me , stepping back , forcing me nearly to the wall . \\n▁ terror raced through me and my eyes flew around the room searching for my mother . \\n▁ i was n't a wimp but these were vampires . \\n▁ they had superhuman strength . \\n▁ they had teeth that could tear your flesh . \\n▁ they drank blood for god 's sake . \\n▁ human blood ! \\n▁ that was what this whole circus was all about ! \\n▁ this selection , i knew instinctively , had turned from what it was supposed to be - a cultured , controlled ceremony where the uninitiated were to display themselves in hopes of getting selected to service their master or mistress , as the case may be . \\n▁ upon entry it felt safe , regardless of what the process would eventually mean to the xxunk . \\n▁ now it was anything but safe . \\n▁ my eyes found my mother and she was staring at me , an hors xxunk in her hand frozen halfway to her mouth . \\n▁ i knew from her pallor that my instincts were right . \\n▁ confirming this , i noticed cosmo had left her . \\n▁ he was moving through the crowd swiftly but surely , his face set and angry , his direction taking him toward stephanie and me . \\n▁ while he moved , the two new vampires closed in . \\n▁ not knowing why , my body prepared to run . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ! '' \\n▁ avery bellowed from the door and everyone , not just stephanie , cosmo , nestor and the two vampires that had approached but everyone in the room stopped , went silent and turned to the door . \\n▁ i did as well . \\n▁ at the top of the steps stood a man . \\n▁ no , not a man , a vampire . \\n▁ man or vampire , he had no equal . \\n▁ upon looking at him i felt as if someone had put a hand to my throat at the same time they shoved another in my chest , both at throat and chest i felt a painful squeeze . \\n▁ tall , taller than anyone there , at least six foot four , maybe six foot five , he was huge . \\n▁ he did n't have lean , compacted muscle . \\n▁ his muscle was not lean , not compacted . \\n▁ it was massive , powerful , even brutal . \\n▁ his hair was black , so black it shone and it was thick , even had a little wave . \\n▁ it was too long , not in a way where it looked unkempt , in a way that said he did n't have time to bother with such unimportant things as routine haircuts . \\n▁ it looked great on him . \\n▁ everything looked great on him . \\n▁ his dark suit , his dark shirt , the fact that he was the only man not wearing a dress shirt and bow tie but that the top buttons of his shirt were open , exposing an attractive column of corded throat . \\n▁ he was n't beautiful , he was n't even handsome or not your normal , everyday type of handsome . \\n▁ his look was too rough , too rugged , somehow both savage and compelling . \\n▁ it was crazy to think it but he had the most perfect nose i 'd ever seen , straight and long . \\n▁ ditto with his jaw , square and strong . \\n▁ ditto with his sharp cheekbones , his full lips , even his chin . \\n▁ and , f * * king hell , his eyes . \\n▁ black , intense and staring at me . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' i breathed . \\n▁ then i watched from across the room in rapt fascination as his eyelids lowered , just partially , xxunk those spectacular eyes and his magnificent lips twitched as if he was fighting back a smile . \\n▁ he 'd heard me . \\n▁ fuck ! \\n▁ i thought . \\n▁ so much for appearing cold , disgusted and uninterested with this whole mess , i 'd practically drooled . \\n▁ he moved down the stairs not gracefully but powerfully , his movements somehow seeming to devour the distance . \\n▁ his eyes left me and he headed toward cosmo . \\n▁ ` ` not so brave now , hmm , nestor ? '' \\n▁ stephanie taunted and i tore my gaze from lucien to look at nestor and stephanie continued . \\n▁ ` ` leah would n't have blooded your contract anyway . '' \\n▁ ` ` i did n't expect her to . '' \\n▁ nestor was calm , the other two vampires that had started to close in now moved away . \\n▁ ` ` i expected to state my intentions and get her to a contract room . \\n▁ she 'd refuse and be forced to leave the selection . \\n▁ no second chances , alas . \\n▁ not until another selection . \\n▁ by that time , lucien would need to feed , he 'll have to select tonight . \\n▁ but leah would n't be a choice . '' \\n▁ ` ` not very bright to expose your plan , '' stephanie commented with derision . \\n▁ nestor flashed a satisfied smile . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't mine . \\n▁ it was katrina 's . '' \\n▁ stephanie hissed angrily at this news but nestor ignored her and turned his eyes to me . \\n▁ ` ` though , seeing you , i would have been tempted , even tempted to coax you to blooding my contract . '' \\n▁ he leaned in around stephanie , ignoring her body tensing again , the growl emitting from her throat , he got close to me and muttered , ` ` i reckon i 'd help you beat your mother 's record . \\n▁ seven years would n't be enough of you . '' \\n▁ he pulled away and said to stephanie , ` ` katrina has reason to be angry , just f * * king look at her . '' \\n▁ his head jerked toward me . \\n▁ ` ` i see her , '' stephanie ground out . \\n▁ ` ` do you smell her ? '' \\n▁ nestor whispered almost reverently and i felt that hand at my throat , the other one at my heart and they were squeezing again . \\n▁ then nestor chuckled . \\n▁ ` ` of course you do , just not your kind of scent is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` fuck off , '' stephanie clipped . \\n▁ ` ` will you two quit talking about me as if i ' m not here ? '' \\n▁ i demanded , fed up , freaked out and scared out of my ever - loving mind . \\n▁ nestor went still , his brows snapped together and he gave me a look so ferocious it made me feel as if the moment before i was n't actually scared out of my mind . \\n▁ now i was scared out of my mind . \\n▁ ` ` what did she just say ? '' \\n▁ he asked stephanie on an enraged whisper but his eyes never left me . \\n▁ ` ` it looks like magnus just claimed the xxunk girl , '' stephanie told him instead of answering his question . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't move fast , nestor , the only one left will be the howard . '' \\n▁ nestor 's head swung around and we watched a vampire with dark brown hair leading a very beautiful and somewhat less desperately dressed uninitiated up the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` fucking hell , '' nestor muttered , shot a glance at stephanie , swept me from top - to - toe with his gray eyes and then he moved away . \\n▁ ` ` dickhead , '' stephanie muttered . \\n▁ ` ` um , do you want to tell me what that was all about ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ stephanie took my arm in her hand and moved me into the room all the while talking in a low voice . \\n▁ ` ` the fist bit , i 'll let lucien explain to you if he desires . \\n▁ the last bit , you must know . \\n▁ you have n't been to your studies , obviously , but i suspect your mother gave you some instruction . \\n▁ i do n't know if you 're ignoring it or have a death wish . '' \\n▁ she stopped and turned to me , we were the same height and her eyes leveled on mine . \\n▁ hers were serious . \\n▁ ` ` never disrespect a vampire , leah . \\n▁ cosmo and i , tonight , will be okay with it . \\n▁ lucien , never . \\n▁ do n't ever disrespect lucien . \\n▁ after you do your study , cosmo and i 'll not be patient with it either . \\n▁ you need to know this . \\n▁ and tonight any vampire that approaches you , you treat with respect . \\n▁ it 's important , to your mother , your family , the legacy of your family past and present and , most of all , it 's important to lucien . '' \\n▁ i had to admit i was getting more than a little bit sick of this lucien business . \\n▁ mostly not knowing what in the hell everyone was talking about and especially now that i 'd laid eyes on him . \\n▁ however , i was n't stupid . \\n▁ stephanie was being serious , she was also being real . \\n▁ she was n't trying to scare me , she was telling me like it was . \\n▁ she was trying to protect me . \\n▁ even though she was a vampire , i decided not to throw that back in her face . \\n▁ i might be a lot of things but i was n't someone who would do that . \\n▁ ` ` now i 'll introduce you to one of my old concubines , '' she told me , her voice back to friendly and cheerful . \\n▁ she led me to a man who had to be seventy years old and , i will add , stephanie looked about twenty - five , but he was a fit , still handsome seventy year old with an even fitter , more handsome thirty - something man with him . \\n▁ the younger was the only man in the room wearing a red bow tie . \\n▁ a blood red bow tie . \\n▁ another uninitiated . \\n▁ a male one . \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ i tried to be cool even though this was something mom had n't shared with me . \\n▁ it was obvious stephanie was fond of both the men . \\n▁ they laughed , they chatted , they drew me into their conversation . \\n▁ after we said farewell , stephanie led me away and i said , ` ` i did n't know there were male concubines . '' \\n▁ ` ` there were n't , '' stephanie replied . \\n▁ ` ` but i lobbied the dominion , which means i bitched and moaned so much a hundred and fifty years ago they recruited males , thank christ . '' \\n▁ she turned to me , plucked my empty champagne glass out of my hand and exchanged it with a full one from the tray of a passing waiter . \\n▁ ` ` no offense . '' \\n▁ she grinned as she gave me my new glass . \\n▁ ` ` no offense ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ she was still grinning when she said , ` ` girls taste good . \\n▁ boys taste better . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' i whispered , looking at the floor and going back to being flipped out by this entire business . \\n▁ ` ` not surprisingly a lot of female vamps were pretty pleased at the new recruits . \\n▁ also not surprisingly so were some males . '' \\n▁ she chuckled and the sound was nearly as beautiful as she was . \\n▁ so much so , i lifted my eyes to her as she carried on , ` ` though , some females still prefer their girls . \\n▁ it 's the way of the world , no ? '' \\n▁ i nodded because it was indeed . \\n▁ freakishly , i had to admit , i liked her . \\n▁ therefore , i got closer to tell her something . \\n▁ something i had n't , until that moment , admitted to myself . \\n▁ ` ` something 's wrong , '' i whispered and she tensed . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ i shook my head and looked around . \\n▁ then i caught her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ i feel funny . '' \\n▁ and i did . \\n▁ after nestor left … no , it was before that . \\n▁ after lucien arrived , it happened . \\n▁ it was n't the hands at the throat and heart thing . \\n▁ it was something else . \\n▁ something that tugged at the edges of my consciousness . \\n▁ something that was making me feel weird , like i was drugged . \\n▁ i looked at my champagne . \\n▁ ` ` i think i ' ve been drugged , '' i breathed . \\n▁ the rigidity left her body , her face grew soft and she got close . \\n▁ ` ` you have n't been drugged , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` i have n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , you have n't . \\n▁ he 's tracking you . '' \\n▁ i blinked then i went rigid . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ who ? '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' was all she said . \\n▁ my eyes flew around the room . \\n▁ it was n't hard to spot him . \\n▁ he was standing with and talking to two men and a woman . \\n▁ but his black eyes were on me . \\n▁ ` ` tracking me ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , looking directly into those eyes . \\n▁ yes , my pet . \\n▁ tracking you . \\n▁ marking you . \\n▁ mine . \\n▁ i dropped my champagne flute . \\n▁ in a flash of movement that did n't register on me , stephanie 's hand shot out and caught the glass before it fell to the carpet . \\n▁ those words , spoken in a deep , throaty voice , sounded not aloud but in my head . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' i was still whispering . \\n▁ ` ` yes , honey , tracking you . '' \\n▁ stephanie 's voice sounded amused and i tore my eyes from lucien and looked at her . \\n▁ the minute i did she smiled . \\n▁ ` ` oh , leah , it 's good . \\n▁ when i say that , i mean it 's good . \\n▁ the buchanan women have been aiming for lucien for centuries . \\n▁ everyone aims for him . \\n▁ the only catch that comes close is cosmo and your mother had him , '' she paused then grinned a cheeky grin , ` ` and , of course , me . '' \\n▁ she chuckled then said , ` ` you do n't have to look so scared . '' \\n▁ ` ` he just … stephanie , he just … ` ` i stammered then heard more words in my head . \\n▁ no , leah . \\n▁ do n't tell her . \\n▁ my mouth snapped shut . \\n▁ i did n't snap it shut ; it just did what it was told . \\n▁ oh my god , i repeated in my head , panic overwhelming me . \\n▁ relax , my pet . \\n▁ he spoke again , also in my head . \\n▁ leave me alone ! \\n▁ i shouted , yes , yet again , in my head . \\n▁ i heard his laughter not with my ears . \\n▁ it was even more beautiful than stephanie 's . \\n▁ it was so beautiful , it was enthralling . \\n▁ and it was n't just amused laughter , it sounded slightly surprised , slightly expectant , even , i could sense , slightly aroused . \\n▁ what in the hell ? \\n▁ ` ` i can hear it , '' stephanie said softly , tearing me with a start from my nonverbal conversation . \\n▁ ` ` and see it , '' she went on and i stared at her . \\n▁ ` ` he 's marked your every movement . \\n▁ even the slightest movement you ' ve made , leah , he 's marked it . \\n▁ his heart is beating in tandem with yours exactly . \\n▁ everyone knows , every vampire here that is , they can all hear it , see it , sense it . '' \\n▁ her voice went softer , turning reverential . \\n▁ ` ` nobody can do that like lucien . \\n▁ it 's beautiful . '' \\n▁ she was n't talking about him speaking in my head . \\n▁ she was explaining what tracking meant . \\n▁ still , i was stuck on another point . \\n▁ ` ` his heart is beating ? '' \\n▁ i asked her . \\n▁ she nodded on another smile . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve got lots to learn , honey . '' \\n▁ i was so shocked at this news i forgot that a vampire across a crowded room was speaking in my head . \\n▁ ` ` vampires ' hearts do n't beat , '' i told stephanie stupidly , since she was one , she should know . \\n▁ ` ` oh yes they do . \\n▁ you 'll see , '' she sing - songed , grabbing my hand and moving me around , heading in the direction of lucien . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what he 's playing at but enough 's enough . \\n▁ i ' m hungry . '' \\n▁ she was moving us toward lucien . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ really , really , no . \\n▁ i dragged my feet and hissed , ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ she did n't answer my question , instead she said , ` ` i figure he 's showing you off . \\n▁ it 's his way which is normally quite interesting but right now it 's annoying . \\n▁ i ' m tired of playing bodyguard . \\n▁ again , no offense but i want to get to reed tonight . '' \\n▁ her fingers gave my arm an affectionate squeeze and her strength did n't allow me to drag my feet , powering me ever forward . \\n▁ i tugged at my arm . \\n▁ her fingers gave me another squeeze , this one different , telling me i would not get away . \\n▁ i tried something different . \\n▁ ` ` listen , stephanie , i do n't want to be selected tonight . '' \\n▁ ` ` no chance of that , '' she told me happily as she drew me ever closer . \\n▁ i stopped talking when i looked at lucien . \\n▁ his eyes were again locked on me , marking me , as stephanie said and finally , i got it . \\n▁ they were possessive , declaring ownership , bottom line , i was his . \\n▁ i could see this even from a distance . \\n▁ i could even sense it . \\n▁ others watched , swinging their gazes between him and me . \\n▁ my heart started beating even faster as the people he was standing with noticed our approach and stepped aside , clearing a path to him . \\n▁ no ! \\n▁ no , no , no , no ! \\n▁ my mind shouted , my eyes again locked on his . \\n▁ yes , he said in my head . \\n▁ seriously , stop doing that ! \\n▁ my brain yelled at him . \\n▁ i heard another chuckle in my head . \\n▁ i scowled at him . \\n▁ he burst out laughing , this time not in my head but out loud . \\n▁ this was , to all those around him , for no apparent reason and they stared at him , stunned . \\n▁ but i knew the reason . \\n▁ my scowl was joined by my nose wrinkling in irritation . \\n▁ he shook his head , a smile still tugging at his beautiful mouth . \\n▁ stephanie brought me to a halt right in front of him . \\n▁ he was taller than he seemed from a distance , bigger , more powerful , completely overwhelming . \\n▁ he made me feel small . \\n▁ i was n't small , not by any stretch of the imagination . \\n▁ i was five foot nine , over six foot in my blood red shoes . \\n▁ i wore a c - cup bra . \\n▁ my ass was my nemesis , it always had been . \\n▁ it was completely impervious to every diet known to man . \\n▁ your normal , average , every day guy could n't pick me up , not for more than a couple of seconds anyway . \\n▁ this man , even if he was n't a vampire , could have done it . \\n▁ no doubt . \\n▁ i felt fragile in the face of him . \\n▁ breakable . \\n▁ delicate . \\n▁ all conversation in the room had again died . \\n▁ the entire room was silent . \\n▁ everyone was watching . \\n▁ i opened my mouth to say something , likely something foolish , when stephanie spoke . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' she began , her voice impatient . \\n▁ he cut her off , eyes locked on mine , he did n't lead into it , he did n't even say ` ` hello '' . \\n▁ instead , his deep , strong , throaty voice announced loudly , ` ` i declare my intentions . '' \\n▁ oh shit . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , god , '' my mother breathed happily from behind me . \\n▁ chapter two the contract ` ` get out , '' lucien growled . \\n▁ this was not going well and he did n't like it . \\n▁ leah glared at him . \\n▁ her mother , lydia , stared in horror , at her daughter 's behavior or lucien 's break with tradition he did n't know . \\n▁ he also did n't care . \\n▁ cosmo , who had been smiling until the moment lucien growled , now frowned with concern . \\n▁ avery stepped forward . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , you know the law . \\n▁ you need consent . \\n▁ your second must be present as must the uninitiated 's distinguished . \\n▁ even you ca n't - '' avery started . \\n▁ lucien lifted a hand and avery ceased speaking . \\n▁ he knew . \\n▁ he 'd been f * * king well living the nightmare for five hundred years . \\n▁ he bloody well knew . \\n▁ this was also something about which he did n't care . \\n▁ ` ` go , '' lucien ground out . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , do n't do this , '' cosmo implored . \\n▁ lucien lowered his voice to a dangerous rumble . \\n▁ ` ` now . '' \\n▁ there was a hesitation before avery , as ever , played diplomat . \\n▁ glancing at the occupants of the room , avery said on a whisper , ` ` there 's a way . \\n▁ no one need know , cosmo . \\n▁ this does n't leave this room . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't like it , '' cosmo replied to avery . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , let me talk to her , '' lydia pleaded , her hand coming toward him . \\n▁ ` ` i will not say it again , '' lucien snarled . \\n▁ with that , they knew they 'd tried his patience , they knew what that meant and without further hesitation all of them moved to leave . \\n▁ including leah . \\n▁ ` ` not you , '' he demanded and everyone turned . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ leah asked , her soft , sweet voice grating on his nerves . \\n▁ ` ` not you . \\n▁ you stay . '' \\n▁ her eyes darted to her mother , cosmo , avery then back to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` but i thought - '' ` ` come over here , '' lucien ordered , cutting off her words as the others quickly and silently left the room . \\n▁ she did n't do as he 'd commanded . \\n▁ instead , she looked at the closed door in confusion . \\n▁ in fact , since she 'd stepped foot in the contract room she had n't done a single thing that he 'd commanded . \\n▁ it was n't just her voice that was grating on his nerves , everything about her was . \\n▁ he 'd expected to enjoy this . \\n▁ he had n't had a challenge in five hundred years . \\n▁ he was n't enjoying this . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he called , his voice as strained as his patience . \\n▁ her head snapped around . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ she asked sharply . \\n▁ he felt his body go taut fighting back the desire to teach her the respect he was owed . \\n▁ instead of acting on this urge , he warned quietly , ` ` do n't ever speak to me that way . '' \\n▁ she stared at him , confusion warring with fear in her face , another look he had n't seen in a long time . \\n▁ a look he liked , a look he missed , a look he craved . \\n▁ this appeased his anger . \\n▁ not all of it , but enough . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't get it , '' she said , the same fear and confusion in her voice and he felt it stir his blood . \\n▁ especially the fear . \\n▁ every concubine itched to be selected . \\n▁ this served a purpose but it also eradicated the chase , the capture , the taming . \\n▁ all of which lucien also liked , missed and most assuredly craved . \\n▁ her fear was as delicious as her face , her hair , her eyes , her br * * sts , that ass , her f * * king scent which had practically brought him to his knees the minute he 'd entered the selection and caught it . \\n▁ as it had done the first time he saw her , smelled her , years ago , after which he 'd marked leah buchanan as his . \\n▁ everyone knew it , they had for decades . \\n▁ except , of course , leah . \\n▁ she kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` i thought if i refused to blood your contract that i was free to go . '' \\n▁ lucien pulled in a calming breath . \\n▁ it failed to calm him however his voice sounded less impatient when he explained , ` ` if nestor had declared his intention . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ magnus . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ hamish . \\n▁ the same . \\n▁ any one of them , '' he paused , gesturing to the door with his hand to indicate the selection before he finished , ` ` me ? \\n▁ no . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not you ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` because i want you . '' \\n▁ ` ` but i do n't want you . '' \\n▁ ` ` that does n't matter . \\n▁ you 're mine . '' \\n▁ she blinked then rallied , ` ` but , mom said the rules are absolute . \\n▁ no one breaks them . \\n▁ ever . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not no one . '' \\n▁ her head jerked with surprise . \\n▁ ` ` who are you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m your master . '' \\n▁ now she started to look angry . \\n▁ ` ` no one is my master . '' \\n▁ ` ` i am . '' \\n▁ she stared at him , anger displacing the fear , her hands balled into fists and she leaned toward him before she declared , ` ` you . \\n▁ are . \\n▁ not . '' \\n▁ he 'd had enough . \\n▁ come here , leah . \\n▁ instantly she moved to him . \\n▁ lucien watched as the anger disappeared and the confusion came back . \\n▁ so did the fear . \\n▁ a great deal of it . \\n▁ so much the room reeked of it . \\n▁ it mingled with her scent . \\n▁ he had the forbidden desire to snatch her in his arms , rip open her throat at the same time he ripped off her clothes and buried his c * * k in her so deep , he 'd feel his own thrusts as her blood poured into his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` stop doing that , '' she whispered as she halted less than a foot from him . \\n▁ silence , he demanded and her mouth clamped shut . \\n▁ better , he told her . \\n▁ she glared at him , her hands again fists at her sides but she did n't move away from him . \\n▁ she was straining to do it but she could n't . \\n▁ he was n't allowing it . \\n▁ it did n't matter , she fought it . \\n▁ he liked that . \\n▁ give me your hand . \\n▁ she lifted her hand to his and watched it move , horror and anger in her eyes . \\n▁ he turned , his fingers curling around the sharp dagger which was one of four things on the shining , oval table next to him . \\n▁ there was also their contract , as big as a poster board , ivory parchment , tiny xxunk words from the very top to near the bottom . \\n▁ there was only an inch of space for their signatures . \\n▁ all if it were words declaring her blood his , giving him feeding rights and in return he 'd take care of her , not through the length of the arrangement but until she took her last breath on this earth . \\n▁ what she did not know , cosmo did not know , her mother did not know but avery did know was that lucien had the five hundred year old agreement altered . \\n▁ upon entry to the room , she 'd sat and read every word , something not one single concubine he 'd selected in five hundred years had done . \\n▁ she had no way of knowing the changes he 'd ordered avery to make or she would n't until she attended her studies . \\n▁ he 'd planned for that and was prepared for the consequences . \\n▁ nevertheless , or likely because , after she finished reading it , her face pale , her eyes seething , she tossed it on the table , caught lucien 's gaze and announced , ` ` not on your life . '' \\n▁ thus had started lucien 's demands , her mother 's pleading , cosmo 's chuckles and avery 's grins . \\n▁ not to mention lucien 's irritation . \\n▁ also on the table were the quill and the joining bowl , a small , oval , crystal plate that sat on four tiny crystal feet by the quill . \\n▁ both of which , lucien decided , they would be using now . \\n▁ lucien 's hand lifted to hers and his fingers wrapped around it . \\n▁ he forced her index finger straight and she fought that too . \\n▁ she knew she 'd never win but she did it anyway . \\n▁ he was , he found , finally enjoying this . \\n▁ ` ` keep fighting , my pet , i like it . '' \\n▁ she stopped struggling immediately . \\n▁ he grinned at her . \\n▁ she scowled at him . \\n▁ he lifted the dagger to pierce her finger but stopped and looked at her . \\n▁ her eyes flew from her finger to his . \\n▁ he could see the pleading . \\n▁ yes , he was enjoying this . \\n▁ he dropped the dagger on the table . \\n▁ he felt her relief hit the room . \\n▁ her heart had started beating wildly , tripping over itself . \\n▁ now it began to slow . \\n▁ his eyes moved to hers as he lifted her hand toward his mouth , finger still forced to extended by his thumb . \\n▁ he felt her body tense , the fear invade , her heart picking up the pace as her hand resisted its ascent . \\n▁ she was magnificent . \\n▁ no ! \\n▁ she cried in her brain . \\n▁ he opened his mouth , put her finger to his lips and sucked it inside . \\n▁ she went completely still and her eyes dropped to his mouth . \\n▁ with effort he fought back the arousal he felt at his first taste of her and the direction of her gaze . \\n▁ christ , she tasted f * * king good . \\n▁ he used a single tooth to tear open the pad of her finger . \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ she breathed in her mind as he sensed her registering the brief pain . \\n▁ he 'd been wrong , her skin tasted lovely but her blood was glorious . \\n▁ with regret he extracted her finger from his mouth , pushed her hand to one end of the joining bowl and pressed several drops of blood from the wound into the bowl . \\n▁ she resisted this too and lucien found this vaguely surprising . \\n▁ she knew she could n't win . \\n▁ he had her trapped with his mind and even if he did n't , she could never overpower him physically . \\n▁ he found he liked her stubbornness when he had her at his command . \\n▁ it was when he did n't he found it annoying . \\n▁ when he was done , he returned her finger to his lips and his tongue darted out , lashing the cut . \\n▁ the bleeding stopped instantly . \\n▁ through his saliva the wound would be healed within the hour . \\n▁ he released her hand but demanded , dip the quill in your blood and sign the contract . \\n▁ her body jerked , strained and , he was intrigued to see , she hesitated a second before she did as she was told . \\n▁ he watched as she did this , her face pale , her body trembling . \\n▁ could she possibly fight xxunk ? \\n▁ it was , he knew , impossible . \\n▁ however , if she could , she 'd be even more fun . \\n▁ she put the quill down and turned to him . \\n▁ i hate you . \\n▁ he put a hand to her neck , his thumb resting along her jugular , her heart beating heavily against his skin and in his ears . \\n▁ ` ` that wo n't last long , my pet , '' he assured her . \\n▁ do n't call me your pet . \\n▁ ` ` you are my pet . '' \\n▁ she wrinkled her nose at him , it was meant to communicate her irritation and disgust . \\n▁ however , he found it adorable . \\n▁ he had not , until she 'd done it in the selection , had anyone xxunk him while he was communicating xxunk . \\n▁ he 'd been surprised and pleased she had this heretofore unknown ability . \\n▁ it would make things more interesting . \\n▁ hell , it already was . \\n▁ he turned to the table , took the dagger and pierced his own finger . \\n▁ going through the same motions as she 'd done , he signed the contract . \\n▁ once completed , he used the tip of the dagger to mingle their blood in the plate as she stood trembling beside him . \\n▁ he moved into her and her body tensed . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't fight it , leah . '' \\n▁ this ca n't be legal , she snapped . \\n▁ she was right . \\n▁ it absolutely was n't . \\n▁ if anyone knew he 'd forced her signature through xxunk , he 'd be punished . \\n▁ or they 'd try to punish him . \\n▁ they would n't succeed , of course . \\n▁ they 'd have to kill him first . \\n▁ she was , he knew without a doubt , going to be worth any risk . \\n▁ he positioned her in front of him , one of his arms going around her waist holding her tight against his chest and his stomach . \\n▁ her sweet ass pressed to his thighs . \\n▁ feeling her soft body against his hard one , he knew it would be a long week to wait for the bloodletting . \\n▁ he reached across the front of her taking up the quill and he dipped it in their combined blood . \\n▁ take my hand in yours , he commanded . \\n▁ she did as she was told . \\n▁ together they wrote the word bound between their names in their mingled blood . \\n▁ it was done . \\n▁ she was his . \\n▁ triumph seared through him . \\n▁ he had n't felt that in a long time either and he liked it the best of all . \\n▁ his arm tensed along her waist as he shoved his face into her neck , smelling her skin , her hair , the perfume that she did n't need , hearing the blood sing warm and moist through her veins . \\n▁ he heard the breath move out of her in a gasp and knew he was using too much strength . \\n▁ he kept her pinned to him and did n't let go . \\n▁ mine , he declared . \\n▁ never , she returned . \\n▁ his mouth moved to her ear and he murmured , ` ` we 'll see . '' \\n▁ he felt her shiver . \\n▁ then he freed her mind and her body from his control . \\n▁ she felt it immediately , turned in his arm to glare at him a moment before she tore herself free and ran directly from the room . \\n▁ chapter three the bloodletting i stood at the window staring out at the night . \\n▁ the sky was free of clouds , the moon full , its brightness frosting the dark , immaculate garden below in a way that was appropriately eerie . \\n▁ my eyes moved from the garden and i caught my reflection in the glass . \\n▁ i looked like an idiot . \\n▁ i was wearing a pale pink nightgown , simple , unadorned by lace or any other xxunk . \\n▁ it was ankle length , slit up both sides all the way to my h * ps with spaghetti straps holding up the bodice and the back under my shoulder blades between a deep exposed v . \\n▁ some strange woman named edwina had come in to do my hair and makeup . \\n▁ she 'd been quiet and watchful but smiling and obviously excited like i was about to be crowned queen of the world . \\n▁ i let her have at it and stayed quiet too . \\n▁ i had too much on my mind . \\n▁ i should n't have stayed quiet . \\n▁ she gave me way too much hair . \\n▁ she also gave me way , way , way too much makeup . \\n▁ i was , imminently , going to get my throat gnashed open by that f * * king vampire 's teeth , he was going to suck my blood and then go home to his mate . \\n▁ why all the fuss ? \\n▁ after the selection i told my mother what happened in the contract room and demanded she contact the vampire dominion and appeal the contract . \\n▁ at first , she looked shaken . \\n▁ then she called my aunts . \\n▁ my aunts called in my sister but surprisingly not my cousins . \\n▁ they had a meeting i was n't invited to which pissed me off . \\n▁ then they contacted the dominion but not to appeal the contract , to get a copy of it . \\n▁ as was my and their due , this we received . \\n▁ avery delivered it personally . \\n▁ behind closed doors , without me there , they 'd perused it for hours . \\n▁ okay , more like an hour but it felt like a million of them . \\n▁ my sister came out first , her face pale , eyes shocked . \\n▁ she said not one single word before she took off . \\n▁ this was surprising . \\n▁ lana was chatty . \\n▁ she could chat anyone 's ear off . \\n▁ i did n't think it was even in her not to say a single word . \\n▁ this was not a good sign . \\n▁ my aunt kate came out next . \\n▁ for some reason she looked shocked too but determined . \\n▁ the oldest of the four buchanan xxunk , as tradition had ingrained in me for four decades , she had the final say . \\n▁ i just did n't like the final say . \\n▁ it was this : ` ` you 'll abide by the contract . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i shouted . \\n▁ ` ` every word , '' she returned . \\n▁ then without one more word , as if she was scared of what those words might be and i swear aunt kate was n't scared of anything , she took off . \\n▁ so did millicent and nadia . \\n▁ my mother stood before me and i demanded , ` ` they ca n't be serious . '' \\n▁ ` ` if you go against us , you 'll be banished from our family , '' my mother replied softly trying , i knew , to take the sting out of her awful words . \\n▁ ` ` if you go against lucien , with that signed contract , he 'll have certain rights , leah . \\n▁ rights you wo n't want him to invoke . \\n▁ rights , i feel relatively certain , he will . '' \\n▁ ` ` and those are ? '' \\n▁ i snapped , tired of the secrets and not scheduled to go to my vampire studies until the next day . \\n▁ vampire studies were two days of learning all things vampire and all things concubine , something i was not only not looking forward to but had , at that moment , no intention of doing . \\n▁ ` ` he 's allowed to hunt you and when he finds you , which he would , he 's allowed to do as he wishes , '' mom answered . \\n▁ ` ` and ` as he wishes ' means suck my blood which is exactly what that contract allows him to do , amongst other things . '' \\n▁ she blanched at my words , something i could n't put my finger on not right behind her eyes , but her next words forced my attention elsewhere . \\n▁ ` ` feed , yes , and not stop . '' \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` he has every right to feed and not stop . \\n▁ as his willing concubine , he 's allowed to feed . \\n▁ once he initiates you and you get used to the feeding , he can do it when he wishes as often as he wishes . \\n▁ but he must stop , not only before he kills you but before he unduly weakens you . \\n▁ if you challenge that contract , he can hunt you and he can feed from you until you 're dead . '' \\n▁ i had nothing to say to that because it was downright terrifying . \\n▁ lucien hunting me down and sucking the blood out of my body until i was dead . \\n▁ he 'd do it . \\n▁ if i defied him , the bastard would not only do it , he 'd love every minute of it . \\n▁ ` ` it 's never happened . \\n▁ not once . \\n▁ not in five hundred years , '' mom informed me , came close and grabbed my hands , both of them , fervently clenching them in her own . \\n▁ ` ` do n't make the first be a buchanan . \\n▁ please do n't , '' she beseeched me . \\n▁ ` ` our name is impeccable . \\n▁ we have the highest selections , the longest arrangements . \\n▁ the shame you 'd create would mean no vampire would associate with us for years , decades , maybe ever . \\n▁ your sister would be released and that would devastate her . \\n▁ rafe adores her . \\n▁ he 's lost no taste for her . \\n▁ she 's set to challenge my accomplishment . \\n▁ your cousins would be released too . \\n▁ and your cousins who have n't seen their selections yet … but they want to , leah … think of them . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't believe you 're asking this of me , '' i whispered and i could n't . \\n▁ it was hideous . \\n▁ all of it . \\n▁ her hands gave mine a squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't understand . \\n▁ go to your studies , you 'll learn . \\n▁ go to lucien . \\n▁ he 'll be good to you , leah . \\n▁ after he initiates you , i promise , you 'll understand . '' \\n▁ ` ` who is this guy ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` he 's lucien , '' she replied as if that said it all . \\n▁ ` ` i think i need more information . '' \\n▁ she nodded but said , ` ` and i 'll give you more , after your studies , after the first bloodletting , when you understand . \\n▁ then i 'll tell you about lucien . '' \\n▁ ` ` why after ? '' \\n▁ ` ` first , you must understand . '' \\n▁ she squeezed my hands again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no doubt he 'll make you understand . \\n▁ after that , '' she smiled , ` ` you might not even care . '' \\n▁ i doubted that then . \\n▁ i doubted it now , standing in this beautiful room , my beautiful room , in my new beautiful house , a room -lrb- and a house -rrb- that the bastard vampire lucien had provided for me . \\n▁ i hated him with all my beating heart . \\n▁ on that thought , the door opened . \\n▁ i whirled toward it and as i ended my whirl , i saw him close the door . \\n▁ i had n't seen him in a week . \\n▁ he was again wearing a dark suit with a dark shirt open at the throat . \\n▁ his eyes never left me as he walked across the room to a chaise lounge where he shrugged off his jacket and threw it on the lounge . \\n▁ eyes still on me , he walked to the side of the bed where he stopped , stood and said , ` ` come here , leah . '' \\n▁ again , i noted , he did n't even say ` ` hello '' . \\n▁ i did n't complain at his lack of greeting . \\n▁ nor did i greet him . \\n▁ i walked toward him . \\n▁ not because i had no control over my own body . \\n▁ that had been too humiliating to endure again . \\n▁ but because i had no choice . \\n▁ and that sucked . \\n▁ he was just as huge and overwhelming as i remembered . \\n▁ more so in this smaller room standing by a bed with me in bare feet . \\n▁ his eyes were more intense too . \\n▁ far more intense . \\n▁ scarily more intense . \\n▁ i stopped a foot in front of him and tipped my head back to look at him . \\n▁ i did n't know him at all but he looked strangely disappointed . \\n▁ i realized why when he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` not feeling stubborn tonight ? '' \\n▁ i was stubborn every night . \\n▁ and every day for that matter . \\n▁ i just was n't stupid . \\n▁ ` ` my mother says , if i run and break the contract , you can hunt me down and murder me . '' \\n▁ his head tipped very slightly to the side . \\n▁ then he said somewhat hesitantly , ` ` that 's right . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , even though the next however long i ' m with you is going to stink , i kinda like breathing and i definitely do n't want you to get your kicks out of taking my life , so , no . \\n▁ i ' m not feeling stubborn . '' \\n▁ i tilted my head back , exposing my throat , tensing my body and ungraciously invited , ` ` have at it . '' \\n▁ i waited , slightly panicked and definitely scared , to be torn asunder . \\n▁ instead , i heard his rich shout of laughter before i found myself in his lap . \\n▁ that 's right . \\n▁ one second i was standing one foot in front of him offering him my blood as his lifeline . \\n▁ the next second -lrb- or maybe half a second -rrb- , he was seated . \\n▁ i was in his lap , one of his arms tight around my front and hip , the other one strong along my spine between my shoulder blades , his fingers in my hair . \\n▁ my torso was pressed to the surprising warmth of his , my arms crushed at my sides . \\n▁ his face was in my neck and he was still laughing . \\n▁ he did this for a while . \\n▁ i sat stiff in his lap while he did . \\n▁ then his head moved , his mouth went to my ear and he murmured , ` ` i knew you 'd be fun . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not trying to be fun , '' i told the wall behind him with total truthfulness . \\n▁ he gently tugged on my hair to pull my head back and he lifted his own to face me . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ that 's why you 're fun . '' \\n▁ i glared . \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ he looked good grinning or i should say , even better , so i sighed . \\n▁ ` ` can we get this over with , please ? '' \\n▁ his eyes traveled over my face and hair . \\n▁ ` ` is this all for me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ his arm came from around my front and his hand gestured to my head . \\n▁ a hand , i might add , that was just as attractive as he was , all long tapered fingers and strong veins , really , it was n't fair . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i repeated , still not knowing what he was on about . \\n▁ ` ` you 're far more beautiful without all that garbage . '' \\n▁ i ignored him calling me beautiful . \\n▁ he was n't going to be a domineering freak , telling me he was my master one meeting and then charm me by calling me beautiful the next . \\n▁ ` ` or are you trying to turn me off ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` do you mean the hair and makeup ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ this genuinely confused me , so much so i did n't guard my answer . \\n▁ ` ` your lady did it . '' \\n▁ ` ` my lady ? '' \\n▁ ` ` edwina . \\n▁ she came in earlier and gave me the works . \\n▁ i thought that was part of the deal . '' \\n▁ ` ` edwina , '' he muttered , a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth , ` ` too many good intentions , not enough sense . '' \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ his eyes focused on mine . \\n▁ ` ` leah , edwina is your housekeeper . \\n▁ she 's not your lady 's maid . \\n▁ do what you wish with your hair and your face . '' \\n▁ he paused then said , ` ` or , i should say , do what i wish with your hair and your face which means no more of that . '' \\n▁ i decided instantly that edwina was going to do my hair and makeup every time he came over . \\n▁ he must have read my mind because he roared with laughter . \\n▁ he did this as he caught me in his arms again , pulling me close to his chest and shoving his face in my neck so his mirth tingled , unwanted -lrb- but also not unpleasant -rrb- , along my skin . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so glad you 're having such a good time , '' i grumbled to the wall . \\n▁ ` ` i am too . \\n▁ thank you . '' \\n▁ his gratitude was also expressed against the skin at my neck in a dry wit that only made him chuckle . \\n▁ ` ` is this going to take all night ? '' \\n▁ i kept grumbling . \\n▁ his mouth shifted from my neck to my ear where he murmured , ` ` impatient . '' \\n▁ for once in my life i was n't . \\n▁ not really . \\n▁ there were two billion and five other things i would prefer to be doing . \\n▁ however , since this was my only choice , i was -lrb- kind of -rrb- ready to have it over with . \\n▁ his face came out of my neck , he pulled back and looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` i see your studies did n't convince you this was something you 'd take to . '' \\n▁ ` ` i was expelled , '' i announced . \\n▁ his brows drew together before he said , ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was expelled , '' i repeated . \\n▁ ` ` you were expelled , '' he repeated after me . \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` from vampire studies , '' he continued . \\n▁ i nodded again . \\n▁ his brows drew further together , ominously further . \\n▁ ` ` why do n't i know this ? '' \\n▁ i ignored the ominous brow draw . \\n▁ ` ` my aunt kate and aunt millicent went to talk to the instructor . \\n▁ they swore him to secrecy , '' i waved my hand in between our faces , ` ` the whole buchanan reputation and all that . \\n▁ they do n't want it besmirched . '' \\n▁ ` ` what did you do ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ ` ` to get expelled , what did you do ? '' \\n▁ i decided to answer . \\n▁ why not ? \\n▁ what could go wrong ? \\n▁ ` ` i was texting my friends , you know , to say good - bye because i had to move here and it 's not close . \\n▁ it was a quick thing for them . \\n▁ obviously i could n't tell them i was all of a sudden a vampire 's concubine because they do n't know you all exist and they 'd think i needed a loony bin . \\n▁ so i had to tell them i had to quit work and care for an invalid aunt they 'd never heard about . \\n▁ they were freaking . '' \\n▁ lucien looked angry though i sensed -lrb- shockingly -rrb- not at me . \\n▁ ` ` they could have simply confiscated your phone . '' \\n▁ ` ` they did , '' i informed him . \\n▁ ` ` then i started passing notes in class . '' \\n▁ his eyes locked on mine then they blinked very slowly . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` why what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why did you pass notes in class ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was bored . '' \\n▁ he made no reply so i explained , ` ` we were in the vampire history part , that 's boring . \\n▁ it went on forever . \\n▁ the other concubines were n't into passing notes . \\n▁ they acted like vampire history was their life 's true meaning so they told on me . '' \\n▁ he sighed and stated , ` ` leah , you 're forty years old . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ so ? '' \\n▁ ` ` is n't it a little juvenile to be passing notes in class at your age ? '' \\n▁ i 'd heard that before . \\n▁ being juvenile was yet another of my bad traits , or so others thought . \\n▁ like my aunt kate . \\n▁ and my aunt millicent . \\n▁ and my aunt nadia -lrb- sometimes , most of the time aunt nadia thought i was a hoot -rrb- . \\n▁ and my goodie - two - shoes , perfection personified cousin myrna . \\n▁ i felt my body grow stiff and my nose , of its own accord , went half an inch up in the air before i declared , ` ` i 'll grow up when i ' m ninety - three years old , not a day sooner . \\n▁ i made a vow to be a girl until then and i ' m sticking to it . '' \\n▁ lucien was silent so i finished with , ` ` i have fifty - three years left . '' \\n▁ he shook his head and dropped to his side on the bed taking me with him so my head was on the pillows but my bottom was tucked into his lap , my calves hanging over his thighs . \\n▁ his big body was at a right angle , his legs were still partially over the side of the bed but he cocked a knee so his thigh was deeper into my bottom and he went up on his forearm beside me . \\n▁ he was towering over me , all huge , bulky vampire and he rested his other arm at a slant across my abdomen , his fingers casually curled into my hip . \\n▁ ` ` that still is n't terms for expulsion , '' he announced while i concentrated on not hyperventilating at this new intimate position . \\n▁ he was acting like we lay in bed , physically touching , nonchalantly discussing the weather , my frequent antics and the meaning of life every freaking day ! \\n▁ not like we barely knew each other , which we did n't . \\n▁ not like he was n't an overbearing vampire who 'd made my life a living hell with his mind games . \\n▁ not like he was a being i hated with all my heart . \\n▁ not like he was there to suck my blood from my body to make him immortal and superhuman . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ like we were something else entirely . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't get expelled for that , '' i said and it came out breathy . \\n▁ i watched close up as his tongue wet his lips then he pressed them together . \\n▁ i did n't know for certain but this did n't seem like a good sign . \\n▁ finally he said , ` ` let 's skip all of your other mischief and get to the part that got you expelled . '' \\n▁ i decided that was a good idea . \\n▁ i was , i should note , wrong . \\n▁ i did n't know that so i informed him , ` ` instead of taking the essay test at the end of the first day , i wrote my will . '' \\n▁ ` ` your will ? '' \\n▁ ` ` my last will and testament . \\n▁ it freaked out some of the girls . \\n▁ it took the instructor a while to calm them down . \\n▁ i did n't mean to - '' i was so busy explaining , i missed his narrowing of the eyes . \\n▁ i should have paid attention . \\n▁ his voice sounded angry , this time definitely at me , when he cut me off by asking , ` ` why in the f * * k were you writing your will in vampire studies ? '' \\n▁ oh my . \\n▁ maybe i should n't have admitted to being expelled . \\n▁ it was clear i definitely should n't have explained why . \\n▁ it was too late . \\n▁ i had to finish it . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a vampire , '' i stated the obvious . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you suck people 's blood . '' \\n▁ ` ` if you 'd paid attention in class , my pet , you 'd know we prefer to call it feeding . '' \\n▁ ` ` whatever , '' i waved my hand between us again , ` ` it 's still my blood . \\n▁ things can go wrong . \\n▁ what if something goes wrong ? '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed further . \\n▁ ` ` nothing will go wrong . '' \\n▁ ` ` you do n't know that . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been doing this for a long time . '' \\n▁ ` ` what if you get really hungry ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll repeat , if you 'd paid attention in class , you 'd know the answer to that . '' \\n▁ ` ` well i did n't so maybe you should tell me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't have the time , or the inclination , to tell you . '' \\n▁ at his words , my body froze and i felt my blood begin to race . \\n▁ ` ` so you 're going to su … i mean , feed ? \\n▁ now ? '' \\n▁ he stared at me then closed his eyes and pulled in a deep breath . \\n▁ when he opened them again they were at my throat . \\n▁ my heart started beating so fast i could feel it . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he said softly , ` ` not now . '' \\n▁ his hand at my hip moved , sliding down the side of my thigh to my knee . \\n▁ then up again . \\n▁ then back again . \\n▁ the slit of my gown having opened , this meant his gentle movements were skin against skin . \\n▁ this felt nice . \\n▁ i did n't want to admit it but my body was n't letting me deny it . \\n▁ i ignored my body and whispered , ` ` why not now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` your heart is beating too fast , my pet . \\n▁ if something could go wrong , which it wo n't , that 's what would make it go wrong . '' \\n▁ ` ` how do you know my heart 's beating too fast ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i can hear it . '' \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ of course he could . \\n▁ i would have probably learned that in class too . \\n▁ ` ` what could go wrong ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ he studied me likely weighing the wisdom of answering . \\n▁ then he said , ` ` after you ' ve had enough , i have to stop the blood from coming so i can heal the wound . \\n▁ if it 's pumping too much , i might not be able to do that . '' \\n▁ ` ` that does n't sound good , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` it would n't be , '' he replied , his hand still stroking my thigh . \\n▁ ` ` that 's why we need to calm you down . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure that 'll work , '' i admitted . \\n▁ ` ` me calming down , i mean . '' \\n▁ he slid his arm out from under his upper body but bent his elbow and put his head in his hand . \\n▁ this pressed his warm chest against my side and brought his face a whole lot closer to mine . \\n▁ ` ` let 's try , shall we ? '' \\n▁ he suggested . \\n▁ i did n't want to try . \\n▁ in fact , i felt hope for the first time in a week . \\n▁ actually , for the first time in four weeks , since i got my invitation to the selection . \\n▁ ` ` maybe we should n't do this tonight , '' i tried . \\n▁ ` ` maybe we should try tomorrow night . \\n▁ or , '' i hesitated , ` ` next week . '' \\n▁ or never but i was n't going to go that far , not yet . \\n▁ my very weak hope was dashed . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't , '' he replied . \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ he sighed and his hand stopped stroking my thigh . \\n▁ his fingers curled into my hip again and he rolled me to my side facing him as his legs came out from under mine and he stretched out full - length beside me . \\n▁ his arm moved around me , his hand sliding up my back to catch a tendril of hair and start playing with it . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll give you a little lesson you should have learned in studies , '' he began with a disapproving tone before i could give into hyperventilating at our newer , far more intimate , position . \\n▁ i pulled my lips between my teeth and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` five weeks ago , i informed the council i would be releasing my concubine and i 'd need to attend a selection . \\n▁ a week ago , three hours before i arrived at your selection , she and i officially ended our arrangement . \\n▁ by law i ' m not allowed to feed until i have my new concubine . \\n▁ not even at a feast . \\n▁ this means i have n't fed in a week . \\n▁ that 's a long time , my pet , '' he finished on a whisper and then went right on whispering , ` ` i need you . \\n▁ tonight . '' \\n▁ i ignored his admission of need , which made me feel strangely aroused . \\n▁ what helped that arousal -lrb- too much -rrb- , was the way he whispered , his deep voice soft and low and somehow physical . \\n▁ instead , i asked , ` ` what 's a feast ? '' \\n▁ his hand went from playing almost tenderly -lrb- all right , so it was tenderly , i could n't deny it -rrb- with my hair , to sliding down my back and drawing circles at its small . \\n▁ that felt nice too , both my body and mind admitted it without delay or quarrel . \\n▁ it just felt nice . \\n▁ really nice . \\n▁ ` ` that i 'll let your mother or edwina explain , '' he told me , still talking low . \\n▁ ` ` so you 're hungry ? '' \\n▁ he nodded and answered , ` ` very . '' \\n▁ ` ` why do you have to wait ? \\n▁ that seems stupid . '' \\n▁ something passed across his face , annoyance , definitely , impatience also , frustration too , i was pretty certain . \\n▁ then there looked to be defiance but that was so fleeting i could n't be sure . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't smart , you 're correct , however it 's also the law , '' he answered . \\n▁ ` ` would n't that make the first bloodletting , the initiation , rather dangerous if the vampire is hungry ? '' \\n▁ i thought he 'd lie . \\n▁ instead he agreed by saying , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` that does n't make sense , '' i whispered and i could feel my heart , which had been slowing , start to speed up again . \\n▁ ` ` i was there when they wrote the law and i still do n't understand it . '' \\n▁ he stopped speaking because i was n't listening . \\n▁ i was panicking . \\n▁ his head cocked slightly then his fingers ceased drawing on my back and his hand flattened , moving over my bottom and up to my hip . \\n▁ ` ` leah , your heart , '' he warned . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't help it ! '' \\n▁ i burst out . \\n▁ ` ` you even admitted you were hungry . \\n▁ what if you ca n't stop ! '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll stop . '' \\n▁ ` ` what if you ca n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` leah , i 'll stop . '' \\n▁ i shook my head and started to pull away but his hand slid down my hip , over my bottom again but this time to cup it and he pulled me closer , pressing my h * ps into his . \\n▁ he was aroused too , very aroused , i felt it immediately . \\n▁ and his arousal made me even more aroused . \\n▁ it was insane but it was true . \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ what was wrong with me ? \\n▁ i stilled against his body and my eyes caught his in shock . \\n▁ his face came close , his mouth barely a breath from mine before he promised , ` ` i wo n't hurt you . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't help it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i can . '' \\n▁ ` ` please do n't do this , '' i whispered my plea . \\n▁ he drew a breath in his nostrils and his black eyes , so close , lost focus . \\n▁ ` ` god , you smell sweet , '' he murmured . \\n▁ ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ when i said his name , his eyes came back into focus and they were more intense than ever . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll like it , '' he told me softly . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ my panic was keeping pace with my arousal . \\n▁ he was turning me on and scaring me to death at the same time . \\n▁ how , i did n't know , but he was doing it . \\n▁ it was as if he sensed this and he liked it . \\n▁ he liked it too much , i could tell because his eyes started burning and that turned me on too . \\n▁ ` ` in a week , you 'll be begging me for it , '' he said quietly . \\n▁ my pulse spiked and my breath went ragged . \\n▁ his eyes flared . \\n▁ ` ` calm , my pet , '' he murmured , his hand pressing into my behind , his h * ps starting to grind against mine . \\n▁ that felt good too . \\n▁ my lips parted , my br * * sts swelled and my ni * * les went hard , all at the same time a rush of warmth flooded between my legs . \\n▁ in a second i was going to kiss him . \\n▁ i had to . \\n▁ it was n't even my choice . \\n▁ i was n't in control of myself . \\n▁ this was n't mind games . \\n▁ this was n't even head games . \\n▁ this was all me . \\n▁ my eyes dropped to his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he called but i could n't tear my eyes from his mouth and my h * ps started moving against his . \\n▁ ` ` leah , stop , you 're making this harder on me , '' he warned and his hand at my ass moved up my back . \\n▁ but i could n't stop . \\n▁ i was driven , for some reason out - of - control . \\n▁ it was then i made a near fatal mistake . \\n▁ in an effort to get closer , i hooked my leg over his hip . \\n▁ the instant i did , his head jerked down nearly colliding with mine and he glanced down between our bodies in the direction of my lap . \\n▁ i heard him draw another breath through his nostrils . \\n▁ this one seemed urgent , primal , animal . \\n▁ when his head shot back up , i saw his eyes were blazing . \\n▁ hungry . \\n▁ hungry . \\n▁ hungry . \\n▁ hunger was written all over his face . \\n▁ ` ` fuck , '' he growled , rolled over me , pinned my upper body with his colossal weight , one of his arms wrapped around me creating a warm , tight cage and two things happened at once . \\n▁ the first , his mouth was at my throat . \\n▁ i felt excruciating pain there as his teeth tore through my flesh and my blood burst forth into his mouth . \\n▁ the second , his other hand went between my legs , cupping me over my nightgown , my panties , xxunk strong fingers pressed in , invading . \\n▁ i gasped , grabbed his broad shoulders and pushed with everything i had . \\n▁ he did n't budge . \\n▁ i lost track of what his hand was doing between my legs because the pain at my neck was agonizing , unbearable , my lifeblood rushing out of me in a warm , hideous flood . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ! '' \\n▁ i cried , bucking , pushing , fighting . \\n▁ he did n't move , he just drank . \\n▁ it hurt . \\n▁ killer hurt . \\n▁ intolerable . \\n▁ i felt the strength leave me as my blood poured out of me into his mouth , weakening me . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' i gasped , still pushing , blackness penetrating at the sides of my eyes . \\n▁ it was my body 's response either to the terrible pain or the loss of blood or both . \\n▁ i welcomed the loss of consciousness . \\n▁ i could take no more . \\n▁ my hands fell away from his shoulders as the blackness crept closer , my strength vanished and i lay limp in his arm . \\n▁ before the blackness permeated , i felt his head rear up away from my throat and the last thing i remembered was saying on a frail whimper , ` ` you promised . '' \\n▁ then there was nothing . \\n▁ chapter four the day after i opened my eyes and saw it was morning . \\n▁ the sun shone weak around the edges of the heavy , drawn curtains . \\n▁ i felt a moment of confusion , not knowing where i was , my surroundings unfamiliar . \\n▁ then i remembered . \\n▁ my body froze stiff . \\n▁ there was movement behind me and before i could register this i was gently rolled to my back . \\n▁ lucien fully visible but shadowed in the feeble light , was up on a forearm towering over me . \\n▁ stark terror surged through me . \\n▁ i tensed , preparing for escape . \\n▁ the next second i was crushed in his arms , my face tucked in his throat , his big hand cupping the back of my head , one of his heavy thighs thrown over both of mine . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he whispered . \\n▁ my name sounded tormented on his lips . \\n▁ i did n't care . \\n▁ he could feel as badly as he wanted . \\n▁ he could be tormented forever by his actions and forever was a freaking long time for a vampire . \\n▁ promising he would n't hurt me and then inflicting the worst pain i 'd ever felt . \\n▁ promising he 'd stop and then nearly killing me . \\n▁ i assessed my options . \\n▁ i could n't fight him , i 'd never win . \\n▁ even if i did get away , he could control my mind , my movements . \\n▁ therefore , i had no options . \\n▁ god , i really hated him . \\n▁ ` ` please , let me go , '' i demanded to his throat , my voice sounded raspy , brittle and that scared me too . \\n▁ ` ` leah , you must listen to me . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ this did n't hurt . \\n▁ i felt no pain at my throat where he 'd torn my flesh apart , just an odd but profound numbness , like getting your gums shot with xxunk . \\n▁ i decided not to think about that bit of weirdness at that moment . \\n▁ i decided to focus on something else . \\n▁ ` ` the contract did n't say word one about me having to listen to you . \\n▁ you feeding on me , yes . \\n▁ you f * * king me , yes . \\n▁ me listening to you , no . '' \\n▁ his hand left my head and went to my jaw . \\n▁ his thumb under my chin he pressed up cautiously as he tilted his head down to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll explain , '' he declared . \\n▁ i had no idea this was a remarkable declaration . \\n▁ since i 'd been expelled from vampire studies , i had no idea vampires did n't explain themselves . \\n▁ even if i had an idea , i would n't have cared about that either . \\n▁ ` ` are you hungry ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` well ? \\n▁ are you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course not , '' he said on a sigh . \\n▁ ` ` no , of course not , '' i shot back . \\n▁ ` ` had your fill last night , did you ? '' \\n▁ his face grew dark as his arms grew tighter , just to the edge of pain but not quite there . \\n▁ ` ` listen to me , pet . '' \\n▁ ` ` stop calling me that , '' i hissed and watched his face grow even darker . \\n▁ this should have scared me . \\n▁ it did n't . \\n▁ i knew the worst he could do , outside actually finishing the job . \\n▁ ignorance is not bliss . \\n▁ ignorance is torture . \\n▁ ` ` are you going to f * * k me ? '' \\n▁ i snapped in the face of his anger . \\n▁ his head jerked before he asked , ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` fuck me . \\n▁ you fed last night , you 're no longer hungry but you 're still here . \\n▁ i ' m wondering why ? \\n▁ i ' m wondering how i ' m meant to service you now , master . '' \\n▁ his arms tightened again , going over the edge of pain for a fleeting second before he rolled me to my back and settled some of his solid weight on me . \\n▁ his hand went to the side of my head , his fingers curling into my hair there , not gentle , not entirely painful either . \\n▁ i looked into his face and it was carved from stone but his eyes were blazing like last night , but not with hunger or desire . \\n▁ with fury . \\n▁ okay , so maybe now i was a little bit scared . \\n▁ his eyes burned into mine for long moments before he pulled in a deep breath . \\n▁ on his exhale , he said , ` ` considering what happened last night , leah , i 'll let your behavior go this morning . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , thank you , '' i returned with deep sarcasm . \\n▁ his hand tightened in my hair . \\n▁ the not entirely painful part became a little more painful but not unbearable . \\n▁ ` ` do n't try your luck , '' he warned . \\n▁ i really wanted to try my luck . \\n▁ every bad trait that was me screamed at me to try my luck . \\n▁ instead , my eyes slid to the side then i closed them so i did n't have to look at him even in my peripheral vision . \\n▁ ` ` i hate you , '' i whispered . \\n▁ it sounded weak , even scared and i did n't care about that either . \\n▁ his fingers loosened in my hair and he replied softly , ` ` that 's understandable . '' \\n▁ with my head mostly freed , i turned it on the pillow away from him . \\n▁ ` ` please go , '' i begged . \\n▁ he began sifting his fingers through my hair at the side of my head . \\n▁ it felt good . \\n▁ i did n't want it to feel good and i hated him for that too . \\n▁ his deep voice cut through my thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll go , leah , but i 'll be back tonight . '' \\n▁ my eyes flew open and my head jerked back to facing him . \\n▁ ` ` tonight ? '' \\n▁ i croaked , my voice broken with fear . \\n▁ his middle finger touched my temple gently then his hand flattened carefully against the side of my face . \\n▁ ` ` tonight . '' \\n▁ ` ` but , you ca n't need - '' ` ` i 'll not be feeding . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ that meant we 'd be … ` ` i 'll not be f * * king you either , '' he went on . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` then why are you coming back tonight ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we need to talk . '' \\n▁ i stared at him a second before shaking my head again . \\n▁ ` ` no , we do n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` we do . '' \\n▁ ` ` we do n't . '' \\n▁ he sighed again and his face dipped closer to mine . \\n▁ i sucked in my breath . \\n▁ ` ` we do , '' he repeated . \\n▁ now i was angry , freaked out , hating him , terrified of him and confused . \\n▁ ` ` but i thought - '' i started . \\n▁ he cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` tonight . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' his face dipped even closer , so close i did n't suck in breath . \\n▁ i quit breathing altogether . \\n▁ then his lips touched mine , briefly , softly . \\n▁ then he moved from the bed . \\n▁ i got up on an elbow . \\n▁ this took it out of me , my head swam alarmingly and i fell back down . \\n▁ whoa . \\n▁ what was that ? \\n▁ what the hell was that ? \\n▁ before i could process this , he was back , dressed completely except his suit jacket was bunched in his large hand . \\n▁ he leaned in , put a fist in the bed on either side of me and got close . \\n▁ ` ` you need to rest , pet . \\n▁ all day , '' he ordered . \\n▁ ` ` but - '' ` ` rest . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' ` ` all day . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' his mouth touched mine but he did n't kiss me and he kept his eyes open , boring into mine . \\n▁ i quieted . \\n▁ ` ` i took too much from you last night , '' he murmured against my lips . \\n▁ ` ` you need to rest . '' \\n▁ my mouth opened under his and i began to speak , ` ` i - '' i stopped speaking when his tongue darted in and touched mine , startling me . \\n▁ it was a fleeting touch but even so , his open eyes kept mine captive and i registered a distinct , excited flurry in the region of my belly . \\n▁ now . \\n▁ exactly . \\n▁ what was that ? \\n▁ a flurry ? \\n▁ caused by a kiss from my near - murderer ? \\n▁ that proved it . \\n▁ i was deranged . \\n▁ ` ` rest , '' he whispered against my mouth . \\n▁ before i knew it , he was gone . \\n▁ * * * * * i opened my eyes again when i sensed movement in the room . \\n▁ it was light , i could still see the sun shining around the curtains so it was not yet ` ` tonight '' which meant , i hoped , the movement was n't lucien . \\n▁ it was n't . \\n▁ it was edwina tiptoeing around the bed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m awake , '' i announced , cautiously getting up on an elbow . \\n▁ she jumped at the sound of my voice and whirled to face me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're awake , '' she repeated . \\n▁ i nodded , focusing on her . \\n▁ she was a beautiful , older woman , older than my mother . \\n▁ how i knew this i did n't know because her face was nearly unlined but i guessed it to be true . \\n▁ her hair was thick , long and white and it looked soft . \\n▁ it was pulled back in a ponytail at her nape . \\n▁ like yesterday , she was wearing a gauzy outfit , a swirly , peachy - pink skirt and beige - pink flowy blouse cinched with an equally flowy scarf belt low on her waist . \\n▁ she looked like a stylish hippie . \\n▁ strange but true . \\n▁ ` ` lucien spent the night , '' she declared on a strangled whisper . \\n▁ i kept staring at her . \\n▁ then i asked , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she said then spoke no more . \\n▁ ` ` yes , lucien - '' i prompted . \\n▁ ` ` spent the night , '' she breathed in what sounded like deep surprise . \\n▁ god , she was weird . \\n▁ ` ` yes , he did , '' i replied slowly . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ she asked , still in a breathy , stunned voice . \\n▁ why did lucien do anything ? \\n▁ because lucien wanted to , that was why . \\n▁ ` ` he just did , '' i answered . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't … he never … '' she stopped then pivoted jerkily and walked briskly to the windows , throwing open the curtains as she xxunk on . \\n▁ ` ` this is unheard of , unprecedented . \\n▁ i do n't know what to say . \\n▁ i ca n't even - '' ` ` edwina , '' i cut her off . \\n▁ she turned again and the minute her eyes hit me they grew so big , they nearly popped out of her head and she gasped . \\n▁ loudly . \\n▁ at the same time her hand flew to her mouth . \\n▁ i knew i 'd passed out before i 'd been able to pull a comb through my hair and take off my heavy makeup but even what i knew was the sight of me the morning after her fervid ministrations could n't induce that response . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i asked in a frightened voice . \\n▁ ` ` your throat , '' she whispered from behind her hand . \\n▁ my hand flew to my throat . \\n▁ it still felt that weird numb and edwina 's horrified stare was making me strangely embarrassed . \\n▁ i covered the area lucien fed from last night and pushed up from the bed . \\n▁ i was still lightheaded but i fought it , put my feet on the floor , got up and headed to the bathroom . \\n▁ my bedroom … no . \\n▁ strike that . \\n▁ lucien 's bedroom -lrb- i was n't going to claim anything he gave me -rrb- was the biggest bedroom i 'd ever had . \\n▁ painted a warm blush it had a king - sized bed covered in a decadent , fluffy , down comforter with a slightly darker blush , cotton - xxunk cover with beautiful embroidery heavy at the bottom of the coverlet and snaking to lighter up the bed . \\n▁ stacks of downy pillows of all sizes from king , to european to standard in cases and xxunk that ranged from the deepest to the most delicate blush adorned its head , some of them smooth , some of the embroidered . \\n▁ there was a chaise lounge in a corner covered in cream velvet , edged with gleaming dark , intricately carved wood . \\n▁ positioned strategically next to its only arm was a small , ornate , circular table . \\n▁ matching stately but comfy - looking armchairs , each with their own tall , plush , round , tassel - bottomed , button - topped ottomans were arranged in another corner . \\n▁ the chairs shared a carved wood table . \\n▁ a charming writing desk with a laptop computer and stylish desk accessories faced the room from the opposite corner to the chairs . \\n▁ i did n't see any of this . \\n▁ yesterday afternoon after i 'd arrived , i 'd inspected the entirety of the lavish cage lucien had provided for me . \\n▁ i perused the six - bedroom house from top to bottom . \\n▁ why he thought i 'd need six bedrooms with a gigantic kitchen including breakfast nook and comfy seating area , a formal dining room , a sitting room , a living room , a family room , a study , four and a half baths … the list went on … i 'd never know . \\n▁ at that moment i did n't want to know . \\n▁ all i could think about was my throat . \\n▁ i went into the bathroom . \\n▁ another huge room with two sinks , a big mirror , a large , blush - marbled tub set in a platform , under a stained glass window -lrb- if you can believe -rrb- , separate shower cubicle with multiple heads -lrb- some on the walls -rrb- and the toilet had its own room . \\n▁ i turned to the mirror and slowly , wincing slightly to prepare myself for the mutilation i 'd see , took my hand from my throat . \\n▁ then i blinked . \\n▁ there was only an insignificant , inch long , slightly glistening , pinkish scar . \\n▁ ` ` what on earth ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' edwina said , materializing behind me . \\n▁ ` ` can you believe it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i gaped at the non - wound , remembering the tearing sensation last night , the pain , the powerful suction from lucien 's mouth , ` ` i ca n't believe it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't believe it has n't healed , '' edwina breathed . \\n▁ my eyes flew to hers in the mirror . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it has n't healed . \\n▁ how can that be ? \\n▁ they always heal before morning . \\n▁ usually sooner . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open . \\n▁ i snapped it shut moments before asking , ` ` are you joking ? '' \\n▁ her head quirked to the side . \\n▁ ` ` of course not . \\n▁ you know that . '' \\n▁ no , i did n't know that . \\n▁ i 'd been expelled from xxunk - blank vampire studies and the time i 'd been there i did n't pay a lick of attention . \\n▁ i moved away from the mirror , walking toward the huge dressing room that was on the opposite side to the bedroom . \\n▁ this room was also enormous , the walls filled with rails , shelves , drawers and a full - length , three - way mirror . \\n▁ there was enough space to house the wardrobes of a family of five . \\n▁ it even included a lavish , built - in dressing table with dozens of drawers , a big mirror surrounded by hollywood starlet lights and fronted by a blush - velvet padded stool . \\n▁ no kidding , the place was out of a movie . \\n▁ most of it was un - utilized as i 'd only brought two suitcases and a carry - on with me . \\n▁ my mother and aunties were packing up whatever else i 'd need to be shipped . \\n▁ even when they did , it still would n't fill the space and lucien was seeing to the renting of my place while i was servicing him . \\n▁ as i stormed into the dressing room , i announced , ` ` i need to call my mother . '' \\n▁ i walked to the dressing table and had to put a hand out to steady myself . \\n▁ i was still feeling woozy and weak . \\n▁ i needed food . \\n▁ and , as much as i hated to give it to the guy , lucien was right , i needed rest . \\n▁ ` ` um … dear … '' edwina said behind me as i caught my breath , controlled the dizziness and reached for my purse to get my cell phone . \\n▁ i ignored her and started digging through my purse . \\n▁ ` ` dear … '' edwina called from closer . \\n▁ ` ` where is it ? '' \\n▁ i muttered , ` ` i ' m sure it 's - '' ` ` leah , '' edwina said from beside me , ` ` lucien told me you were n't to phone anyone . '' \\n▁ my head snapped up and i looked at her . \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ ` ` direct orders . \\n▁ no calls . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ she shrugged looking uncomfortable . \\n▁ i looked back down at my purse and kept digging , ` ` well , he can order all he likes . \\n▁ i ' m still going to - '' ` ` you wo n't find it . \\n▁ lucien took your phone . '' \\n▁ my head snapped up again and i stared . \\n▁ all i could do was stare . \\n▁ my heart had stopped beating which was pretty strange since my blood was boiling . \\n▁ finally i found my voice . \\n▁ ` ` he took my phone ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and he told me to lock away all the others . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ i straightened and faced her . \\n▁ ` ` well , unlock one . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` you can . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien would be angry . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't care , '' i snapped . \\n▁ her face grew pale . \\n▁ it did n't take a mind reader to know she did n't want to do anything that would make lucien angry . \\n▁ i could understand that . \\n▁ he could be a pretty freaking scary guy . \\n▁ and , i did n't know her , but i still did n't want to scare her . \\n▁ thwarted again by the hated lucien . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to kill him , '' i bit out , my emotion got the better of me and i had to lean against the dressing table to stay standing . \\n▁ ` ` you need food . \\n▁ lucien said the minute you woke , i needed to feed you . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien can go to hell , '' i clipped . \\n▁ she studied me a moment , surprise behind her eyes , her head angled to the side like a bird 's . \\n▁ ` ` i think something 's not right here , '' she announced . \\n▁ ` ` you think ? '' \\n▁ i asked sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` why are you angry with lucien ? \\n▁ no one is ever angry with lucien . \\n▁ well , not no one . \\n▁ he has enemies , of course . \\n▁ but not his concubines . \\n▁ never his concubines . \\n▁ they all love him . '' \\n▁ oh please . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not like the others , '' i proclaimed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sensing that , '' she agreed on a comprehending nod . \\n▁ i dropped my head and lifted my hand to my forehead . \\n▁ ` ` i think i need space , '' i told her , not wanting to be rude but i did . \\n▁ in this moment of tumult in my life , i hated to admit it , but i really needed my mother even though she and her ancestry of xxunk adoring vampire concubines had gotten me into this mess . \\n▁ suddenly , i felt edwina 's hands gentle on me as she pulled me away from the dressing table . \\n▁ ` ` what you need is bed and food , in that order , '' she declared . \\n▁ i went with her because i did n't have the strength to fight . \\n▁ i blamed that on lucien mainly because it was his fault . \\n▁ and i filed it away in my why i hate lucien vault . \\n▁ edwina put me to bed . \\n▁ she came back with a tray covered in food half an hour later , time i spent organizing all the many , many files in my why i hate lucien vault . \\n▁ a stack of light , fluffy , buttermilk pancakes drenched in melting , real butter and warmed syrup . \\n▁ crisp bacon . \\n▁ succulent berries . \\n▁ grilled sausage links . \\n▁ i ate it without complaint . \\n▁ normally i would never eat that much food as food like that , especially in those amounts , magically expanded to ten times its size and weight before it settled on my ass . \\n▁ but i needed my strength . \\n▁ for tonight , i would be battling lucien . \\n▁ chapter five that night lucien drove toward leah 's house feeling a welcome sense of anticipation after a not very good day . \\n▁ she was , he knew , going to be cold or furious but he could n't care less . \\n▁ whatever she was , it would not be eager , it would not be sycophantic , it would not be adoring and it would not be xxunk . \\n▁ it would be something different , something he relished , something he had not had in a very long time . \\n▁ that morning after he arrived at the home he shared with his mate , katrina had been waiting for him . \\n▁ the minute he closed the door behind him , she unleashed the fury that he knew she 'd kept pent up all night waiting for his return . \\n▁ even though he was still furious with her for the plot she 'd attempted to unleash at leah 's selection , she had every right to be angry . \\n▁ a vampire did not sleep with his concubine , not in any sense of that word . \\n▁ he or she did n't spend the night . \\n▁ goodly portions of it , maybe . \\n▁ the entirety of it , never . \\n▁ vampires slept with their vampire mates in every sense of that word . \\n▁ things might , and often did -lrb- and the dominion turned a blind eye -rrb- , get out - of - hand at feasts but not with concubines . \\n▁ the lines were drawn , the boundaries understood and no one , not even lucien , could break them . \\n▁ he ignored his mate , something he 'd been doing a great deal for the past decade , walked upstairs straight to their bedroom , disrobed and got in the shower . \\n▁ she followed , not ceasing for even a breath in her blistering tirade . \\n▁ lucien was angry with himself for losing control with leah and nearly taking her life , something which he would miss , even knowing her such a short time . \\n▁ not only because her blood was heavenly but also because she did n't intend to grow up until she was ninety - three years old . \\n▁ that was a concept he found intriguing and very much wanted the time to explore . \\n▁ he was also angry that he 'd caused her to experience such unadulterated terror . \\n▁ fear was delicious , especially when it was mingled with excitement . \\n▁ terror , or at least the terror he 'd witnessed from leah that morning when she woke , was revolting . \\n▁ last , and most importantly , no matter how much he tried , he could not get the sound of her saying , her eyes filled with pain and accusation , ` ` you promised , '' out of his head . \\n▁ therefore , he was in no mood to deal patiently with katrina . \\n▁ he stepped out of the shower dripping wet and put a hand to her throat , silencing her invective . \\n▁ he lifted her clean off her feet and slammed her against the wall , her skull cracking against the plaster and held her there , his fingers squeezing . \\n▁ she clawed at his forearm with her nails to no avail . \\n▁ he held her squirming against the wall , deftly avoiding her kicking legs until he felt she understood his meaning . \\n▁ then he dropped her . \\n▁ she landed lithely on all fours in a graceful crouch , her head snapping back , her cloud of long , black hair falling over her back , her ice blue eyes glaring at him . \\n▁ her stunning face was contorted with rage . \\n▁ she was preparing for attack . \\n▁ ` ` do n't even think of challenging me . '' \\n▁ his demand was quiet and it was lethal . \\n▁ indecision flickered in her eyes which was a strategic mistake . \\n▁ she should have long since learned to master any situation and indecision showed weakness . \\n▁ she was a young vampire , only two hundred years old . \\n▁ even so she would never learn . \\n▁ she never had . \\n▁ he 'd been trying to teach her for fifty years . \\n▁ in the beginning she was quite like leah , young , amusing , challenging , beautiful and perhaps most importantly , unbelievably sexy . \\n▁ the minute they finalized the claiming she 'd changed . \\n▁ became possessive , intolerably so , jealous , even of his concubines and until leah he 'd never given her reason for this ridiculous emotion . \\n▁ demanding to go with him to feasts -lrb- this he did not allow -rrb- . \\n▁ resistant to his teachings . \\n▁ she 'd been full of promise when he met her . \\n▁ she 'd become a disappointment . \\n▁ he saw the fluid line of her shoulders fall in defeat , an action that defined his discontent with their pairing and without a word he turned and strode back to the shower . \\n▁ in the shower , he came to the swift decision to file for severance . \\n▁ he 'd been toying with it for years . \\n▁ now was the time . \\n▁ it was not unheard of for vampire mates to sever . \\n▁ it was also not nearly as commonplace as the mortals ' divorce . \\n▁ vampires , the vast majority of the time , mated for eternity which , being immortal , meant literally . \\n▁ although it was frowned upon , severance was also never denied . \\n▁ it was not a good idea to force two vampires to live together . \\n▁ it was , they discovered centuries ago , deadly . \\n▁ when he exited the shower katrina had calmed down . \\n▁ he found her curled in a ball on her side in their bed , a bed , at the sight of his defeated and sulking mate , he made the instant decision he would never share with her again . \\n▁ ` ` you must know i deserve an explanation , '' she whispered . \\n▁ he did n't answer mainly because he knew nothing of the sort . \\n▁ ` ` no one spends the night with their concubines , '' she went on . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd lose your mind if i spent the night with kyle . '' \\n▁ this was n't true . \\n▁ there was a good possibility he would n't even notice . \\n▁ her voice dropped below a whisper when she asked , ` ` what is it about her ? '' \\n▁ lucien had been dressing while she talked . \\n▁ finished , he turned to face her and answered simply , ` ` she 's life . '' \\n▁ he watched her body jolt as if struck . \\n▁ then she came up on an arm , her face filling with disbelief and twisting with bitterness . \\n▁ ` ` your life ? \\n▁ you barely know her . '' \\n▁ he crossed his arms on his chest and looked down at his mate . \\n▁ ` ` not my life , rina . \\n▁ life . '' \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what that means . '' \\n▁ she would n't . \\n▁ katrina did n't know the difference between inexpensive champagne and the finest vintage and no amount of instruction or consumption would make her grasp that distinction . \\n▁ he knew this because he 'd tried for fifty years to teach her that exact lesson . \\n▁ there was blood and there was leah buchanan 's blood . \\n▁ it was the difference between eating dust and allowing the finest belgian chocolate to melt on your tongue . \\n▁ feeding from leah was like drinking in heaven . \\n▁ doing it with his hand between her legs , her soft body pinned under the weight of his , enveloped in the smell that was all her mingled with the scent of her sex in a heightened state of arousal , was nirvana . \\n▁ he was looking forward to leah 's taming . \\n▁ regardless of how it happened , if the beauty of last night was any indication , feeding from her while they were physically joined and she gave herself wholly to him would be rapture . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' katrina called . \\n▁ torn from his thoughts and not appreciating it , lucien announced , ` ` we 're finished talking . '' \\n▁ he watched her body go taut as his words penetrated . \\n▁ ` ` now what does that mean ? '' \\n▁ katrina asked on an irritated snap . \\n▁ he did n't answer . \\n▁ he left and put her out of his mind . \\n▁ this was not difficult . \\n▁ he met with stephanie that day . \\n▁ and avery . \\n▁ there were plans to be made and he was making them . \\n▁ he had been making them since he received word from his informant that leah had extricated herself from yet another of her hideously ill - suited boyfriends . \\n▁ the end of her mortal relationship opened her up for selection . \\n▁ with vast and frustrating experience of riding the tempestuous waves leah 's love life , he had not delayed in taking his chance and he , amongst others , had placed her name on his list to receive an invitation to the selection . \\n▁ lucien knew the council would not be blinded to what he was doing for long . \\n▁ they 'd find out . \\n▁ likely , once he filed for severance , katrina would tell them . \\n▁ possibly leah 's family would too although he knew they 'd demanded to examine the contract and she 'd not only gone to study but the xxunk dispatched her for homing . \\n▁ if not those , undoubtedly the council would hear of his actions somehow . \\n▁ and he was ready . \\n▁ stephanie had always been impatient with the immortal and mortal agreement . \\n▁ she 'd even been indecisive on which side she would fight before the revolution . \\n▁ she was a definite ally . \\n▁ avery was a surprise . \\n▁ he 'd been working in his role for the council of the dominion for centuries . \\n▁ lucien had only sensed his willingness to turn traitor . \\n▁ and lucien had been right . \\n▁ cosmo , on the other hand , he 'd been avoiding since leah 's selection , something which he failed to do that day . \\n▁ late in the afternoon cosmo had pressed into lucien 's office , lucien 's secretary , sally hot on his heels . \\n▁ sally halted when cosmo hissed , ` ` are you planning a revolt ? '' \\n▁ lucien nodded at sally who withdrew . \\n▁ once she closed the door behind her , he leveled his eyes on his friend and answered , ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` then what 's this all about ? '' \\n▁ cosmo clipped . \\n▁ ` ` i was there , lucien . \\n▁ leah refused to blood your contract . \\n▁ the next thing i know , it had been signed , avery had filed it , you 'd homed her and the bloodletting was last night . '' \\n▁ lucien did n't speak . \\n▁ cosmo continued , ` ` katrina told nestor who told jordan who told hamish who told me that you spent the night with her . '' \\n▁ lucien knew his secret would n't last long . \\n▁ ` ` i did . '' \\n▁ ` ` have you gone mad ? '' \\n▁ cosmo bellowed . \\n▁ lucien stood , shaking his head . \\n▁ ` ` cosmo , calm down . '' \\n▁ ` ` the council will hear of this , '' cosmo bit out . \\n▁ ` ` they probably already have . \\n▁ katrina was in a state this morning . \\n▁ she 'll not be thinking before she acts . '' \\n▁ not that she ever did , he thought . \\n▁ ` ` they 'll pull you in , '' cosmo warned . \\n▁ ` ` it 's likely . '' \\n▁ cosmo straightened and took in lucien 's composure before asking , ` ` what happened ? \\n▁ did you fall asleep ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , after the initiation , i fell asleep . '' \\n▁ this was true . \\n▁ after he nearly killed her , he stopped the blood , soothed the wound , waited , watching and impatient for long minutes as the healing began . \\n▁ then he watched for long hours as the healing progressed . \\n▁ when he was satisfied all would be well , only then did he pull leah in his arms and fall asleep . \\n▁ however , he had every intention of spending the night with leah even had he not lost control xxunk that he wait for the healing . \\n▁ and he had every intention of spending every night with leah until he lost interest in her and released her . \\n▁ cosmo continued to study him before he remarked dubiously , ` ` so , it was all innocent . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' lucien replied honestly . \\n▁ ` ` it was far from innocent . '' \\n▁ cosmo closed his eyes . \\n▁ in a low voice that held a vein of steel , lucien declared , ` ` i 'll not live like this for another day , cosmo . '' \\n▁ cosmo opened his eyes ` ` you are planning a revolt . '' \\n▁ ` ` it might not lead to that . '' \\n▁ ` ` you know it will . '' \\n▁ lucien shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` then it 's war . '' \\n▁ cosmo pulled in breath through his nostrils at lucien 's words but his face and eyes went blank , hiding his thoughts . \\n▁ katrina could learn from cosmo . \\n▁ quietly , cosmo spoke . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve seen her , lucien . \\n▁ i ' ve smelled her . \\n▁ i like her . \\n▁ she 's fascinating . \\n▁ she 's funny . \\n▁ she 's different . \\n▁ but , '' he paused before finishing , ` ` she 's not worth war . '' \\n▁ ` ` you have n't tasted her , '' lucien returned decisively . \\n▁ cosmo 's head cocked to the side , intrigued despite himself . \\n▁ ` ` she 's that good ? '' \\n▁ ` ` better . '' \\n▁ cosmo 's brows went up before he muttered , ` ` jesus . '' \\n▁ then he continued in a low voice , ` ` did you f * * k her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not yet . '' \\n▁ ` ` you intend to ? '' \\n▁ ` ` absolutely . '' \\n▁ ` ` christ , lucien - '' lucien lost patience . \\n▁ ` ` if i remember correctly there was many a night , for seven years , you left her mother and went direct with me to a feast . \\n▁ not to feed , to f * * k , the way you wanted to f * * k lydia . \\n▁ if i remember correctly , for seven years , you wanted lydia in a way you could n't have her because the agreement said you could n't . \\n▁ it nearly drove you mad . \\n▁ you had to release her before you wanted just to end the torment . \\n▁ do you remember ? '' \\n▁ lucien demanded . \\n▁ ` ` i remember , '' cosmo answered , his jaw clenching . \\n▁ ` ` that is not going to happen to me , '' lucien stated . \\n▁ ` ` i want leah , all of leah , and i 'll damn well have her . \\n▁ i ' m tired of these ancient , absurd edicts ruling my life , your life , stephanie 's life . \\n▁ we 're vampires for f * * k 's sake and everything that is our essence has been stripped away . \\n▁ no more . \\n▁ i ' m taking it back . \\n▁ if they try to punish me , i 'll fight . '' \\n▁ cosmo 's face again lost all expression . \\n▁ because the time might come where he 'd need allies , and cosmo would be an excellent one , not to mention he was a trusted friend , lucien continued to explain . \\n▁ ` ` it 's been over five hundred years since i caught a scent as extraordinary as leah 's . '' \\n▁ understanding lit in cosmo 's eyes . \\n▁ ` ` maggie , '' cosmo muttered . \\n▁ it took an extreme effort of will , even after all of these years , for lucien not to flinch at her name . \\n▁ he ignored his friend 's muttering and carried on , ` ` i caught leah 's scent twenty years ago . \\n▁ i should have had her then . \\n▁ i should have been able to take what i wanted . \\n▁ but i had to wait . \\n▁ twenty years , cosmo . \\n▁ i ' ve lost twenty years . \\n▁ or , more to the point , she 's aged twenty years and i ' ve lost that . \\n▁ my time has come , as has leah 's , and there will be no barriers , no boundaries , no f * * king laws that tell me i can not do what i wish . '' \\n▁ ` ` you intend to tame her , '' cosmo surmised . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve already started , '' lucien announced . \\n▁ cosmo hesitation was brief before he sighed and shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i suppose there will be those who 'll champion you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'd like you to be one of them . '' \\n▁ cosmo went still , his face remaining blank , before he asked softly , ` ` you doubted i would ? '' \\n▁ lucien did n't answer . \\n▁ still speaking softly , cosmo said , ` ` i 'd burn for you lucien . \\n▁ i ' ve proved that before . '' \\n▁ ` ` you have , '' lucien agreed . \\n▁ they locked eyes for long moments before cosmo broke their silent renewed vow of allegiance by saying , ` ` she 'll not be easily tamed . '' \\n▁ for the first time since seeing his friend , lucien smiled . \\n▁ ` ` this is very true . '' \\n▁ cosmo smiled back . \\n▁ ` ` how was she last night ? '' \\n▁ ` ` untamable . '' \\n▁ cosmo threw his head back and laughed . \\n▁ thus ended their tense conversation . \\n▁ lucien turned into the driveway of the home he 'd purchased for leah three months before , just weeks after she 'd ended her last relationship . \\n▁ he 'd broken his own practice and searched for it himself . \\n▁ he gave sally his requirements and attended the xxunk personally , twenty of them , before he found what he wanted to provide for leah . \\n▁ then he 'd hired a team of decorators to fit it to his exacting specifications . \\n▁ when he 'd met edwina there just days before to give her the keys to her new home and place of employment , she 'd been stunned at what she saw . \\n▁ edwina had been housekeeper to his acting concubines for forty years . \\n▁ she knew lucien had a reputation for being particularly generous with them . \\n▁ he kept them well while they serviced him and left them well when he 'd released them . \\n▁ all vampires did the same but , either miserly or unable financially , they did n't do it as lucien did because he was not miserly and he was far from financially unable . \\n▁ but a six - bedroom mansion on a fifteen acre plot was beyond even lucien 's pale . \\n▁ he hit the garage door opener on his visor and slid his sleek black porsche turbo next to the equally sleek , black cayenne he 'd purchased for leah . \\n▁ edwina , likely curious at hearing his car pull in the garage , met him by the kitchen door , her face startled . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she breathed . \\n▁ ` ` edwina , '' he replied in greeting , not pausing but moving beyond her . \\n▁ ` ` you 're here , '' she noted unnecessarily . \\n▁ he stopped in order to ask where leah was as he had no desire to go in search of her and turned back to edwina . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i am . \\n▁ where 's leah ? '' \\n▁ he watched her eyes go round before she blurted , ` ` she 's not ready for another feeding ! \\n▁ and you ca n't be ready for another one either . '' \\n▁ lucien 's gaze leveled on hers and he watched the color run from her face . \\n▁ ` ` sorry . \\n▁ i ' m so sorry , '' she mumbled , looking away . \\n▁ ` ` where 's leah ? '' \\n▁ lucien repeated with ill - concealed impatience . \\n▁ ` ` in her room . '' \\n▁ lucien turned immediately toward the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ! '' \\n▁ edwina called and with reluctance lucien turned back . \\n▁ ` ` she 's … '' she paused , her face still ashen , her fear xxunk the room . \\n▁ ` ` she 's what ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked when she did not carry on . \\n▁ her body twitched then she continued , ` ` she 's … '' and she stopped again . \\n▁ ` ` edwina , '' lucien 's voice was a dangerous hiss . \\n▁ ` ` she 's in a. . . \\n▁ a. . . '' \\n▁ he watched her swallow before she finished , ` ` she 's in a mood . '' \\n▁ leah was in a mood . \\n▁ this was excellent news . \\n▁ slowly , lucien grinned . \\n▁ edwina gawked . \\n▁ lucien turned back to the stairs . \\n▁ as edwina said , leah was in her bedroom though he knew this since he heard her heart beating and smelled her scent the moment he entered the downstairs hall . \\n▁ when he walked through the door he saw her sitting on the chaise , her back to its arm , her legs bent in front of her . \\n▁ she was wearing faded jeans , a pale pink camisole and a lightweight pale green cardigan . \\n▁ her feet were bare but her toes were polished a new color . \\n▁ last night it was a sheer pink , tonight it was a bright fuchsia , xxunk the fact that she obviously disobeyed his command to rest and instead gave herself a pedicure . \\n▁ her long , layered blonde hair fell around her shoulders in soft flips , the tendrils at her neck curving in , framing the graceful line of her throat in an invitation she likely did n't know she was giving but one he savored . \\n▁ her head shot up when he arrived and he noted she was reading a book which she had opened on her thighs . \\n▁ he turned to close the door . \\n▁ when he turned back , her head was again bent to the book . \\n▁ he watched her as he walked into the room , shrugging off his suit jacket . \\n▁ he continued to watch her as he threw it on the foot of the bed and moved closer . \\n▁ and he continued to watch her as he walked past her to the small table at the arm of the lounge . \\n▁ she kept her head bent to her book the whole time , ignoring him but her heart was racing and he smelled her fear . \\n▁ he bent and picked up the bookmark that was resting on the table next to a cold drink and walked to the lounge , seating himself an inch away from her feet . \\n▁ then he twisted his torso , reached out and pulled the book from her hands . \\n▁ her head snapped up and she cried angrily , ` ` hey ! '' \\n▁ this time he ignored her , put the mark in the book and leaned into her . \\n▁ she cringed back against the arm of the lounge , her head turning slightly to the side , the pace of her heart escalating . \\n▁ lucien ignored this too . \\n▁ he deposited the book on the table , leaned in further and put a hand in the chaise on either side of her hips , his stomach and chest brushing her calves . \\n▁ his eyes caught her wary ones and he demanded , ` ` when i come to you , leah , i want you to greet me . '' \\n▁ he watched her jaw tighten and the flash in her eyes and he waited for her reply . \\n▁ she gave it to him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , oh great master . \\n▁ hello . \\n▁ how was your day ? '' \\n▁ he smiled right before he moved . \\n▁ he 'd decided not to hide his heightened abilities from her . \\n▁ he would be nothing but what he was with leah . \\n▁ in a second he had her out of the lounge and xxunk in it , stretched out on her back , lucien at her side up on his forearm leaning over her , his lower body pressed against hers . \\n▁ when he was done , her dark blue eyes were wide , her full lips parted and her breath had stopped . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to use the ` great ' part , pet . \\n▁ ` master ' will do , '' he teased her , still smiling . \\n▁ she wrinkled her nose and glared . \\n▁ he threw his head back and laughed , barely controlling the urge to bury his face in her throat to get closer to her scent , her pulse , her . \\n▁ instead , when he stopped laughing , he put his hand at her fully - healed neck and ran his thumb down her jugular while his eyes watched its movements . \\n▁ then his gaze caught hers . \\n▁ ` ` how are you feeling ? '' \\n▁ he asked quietly . \\n▁ ` ` full , '' she replied in a sharp , unfriendly voice . \\n▁ ` ` edwina is n't skimpy with her portions . '' \\n▁ his brows went up . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve eaten ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ his thumb continued caressing her throat and his eyes moved back to it as he murmured , ` ` i would have liked to share dinner with you . '' \\n▁ he felt her body give a small jolt , his gaze went to hers and he caught her wonder before she could hide it . \\n▁ ` ` you 're surprised ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ she briefly struggled with something before she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` why are you surprised ? '' \\n▁ he went on . \\n▁ ` ` because i eat or because i wish to eat with you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because you eat . '' \\n▁ her voice was still short , clipped , hostile . \\n▁ even so his body relaxed , pressing closer to hers , settling in . \\n▁ hers tensed . \\n▁ ` ` i eat , i drink , i sleep , i bathe . \\n▁ i do everything you do , '' lucien told her . \\n▁ she made no comment to this although her face was filled with curiosity . \\n▁ she hid the curiosity and decided to change the subject , demanding , ` ` are we going to talk ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we are talking . '' \\n▁ she lifted her hand and waved it around . \\n▁ ` ` no , not talking - talking . \\n▁ talking about whatever it was you wanted to talk about this morning . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 'll get to that . '' \\n▁ ` ` can we do it now so you can go ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that has a two part answer , '' he explained and her brows knitted . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a yes or no question , '' she informed him . \\n▁ ` ` then no , to both parts . '' \\n▁ he watched her jaw clench again and he heard her teeth grind together . \\n▁ it took another enormous effort not to laugh . \\n▁ ` ` why ca n't we get this over with ? '' \\n▁ she insisted . \\n▁ ` ` because i 'd like a moment to relax and get a drink . '' \\n▁ she made to move and he allowed more of his weight to settle on her until she stilled . \\n▁ ` ` if you let me up , i 'll get you a drink , '' she offered with false courtesy . \\n▁ he ignored her attempt to get away from him and his gaze moved to her glass . \\n▁ ` ` what are you drinking ? '' \\n▁ she did n't answer as he took his hand from her neck and reached for the glass . \\n▁ he brought it to his nose and inhaled its scent . \\n▁ it was diet cola and rum . \\n▁ his eyes moved to hers . \\n▁ ` ` you should n't be drinking spirits , '' he admonished . \\n▁ her head tilted to the side and her blue eyes grew darker . \\n▁ ` ` is that an order ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for tonight , while you 're still recovering , yes . \\n▁ any other time you can drink what you wish . '' \\n▁ ` ` i just do n't believe you , '' she whispered angrily under her breath . \\n▁ this was something else he ignored while he took a drink from her glass . \\n▁ for some reason , this caused her to protest , her hand shooting out , fingers wrapping around his wrist and jerking to no avail . \\n▁ ` ` hey ! \\n▁ do n't drink from my drink ! '' \\n▁ he replaced the glass on the table and looked at her . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's my drink ! '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't drink my drink ! '' \\n▁ ` ` and why not ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it 's my drink . '' \\n▁ he sighed her name , ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ she mimicked his sigh sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ he could bear it no longer . \\n▁ she was , quite simply , enchanting . \\n▁ he burst into laughter , burying his face in her neck while he pulled her to her side facing him , his arms wrapping tight around her , pressing her torso deep against his chest . \\n▁ ` ` stop hugging me , '' she grumbled over his shoulder , her hands between them pushing against him . \\n▁ his hand slid down her back to its small , right above her ass and he pressed in . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't help it , pet , you 're entirely xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m xxunk ? '' \\n▁ he lifted his head and smiled at her . \\n▁ ` ` entirely . '' \\n▁ her eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` you know , lucien , you need to make up your mind . \\n▁ either you 're this guy or you 're the jerky , controlling guy who i met at the selection or you 're the near - miss murder guy last night . \\n▁ pick one . \\n▁ i ' m getting confused . '' \\n▁ he pulled slightly away , bent his elbow and rested his head in his hand , looking down at her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m all those … guys . '' \\n▁ ` ` can we make a deal that i get to pick which one i want ? '' \\n▁ he was still smiling when he asked , ` ` and which one would you choose ? '' \\n▁ ` ` none of them , in a perfect world . '' \\n▁ he chuckled and she talked through it . \\n▁ ` ` but this one , since we do n't live in a perfect world . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucky for you , you have this one now . '' \\n▁ ` ` then this one would give me back my phone . '' \\n▁ his smile died . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll not be giving back your phone . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay then , '' she shot back , ` ` i do n't have the slightly tolerable one . \\n▁ i have the jerky , controlling one . '' \\n▁ he disregarded her heated words and said , ` ` there are things you need to learn . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and if i could phone my mother , she would teach me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to teach you . '' \\n▁ her mouth snapped shut and she stared before she asked in a soft , stunned voice , ` ` you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` me . '' \\n▁ ` ` why you ? '' \\n▁ it had been a boon she 'd been expelled from vampire studies even if the reason why annoyed him . \\n▁ she had no idea her role or his limitations . \\n▁ all she knew was the contract which flew straight in the face of the law . \\n▁ until he knew why the xxunk sent her to him even after examining the altered contract , she would have nothing to do with them or anyone . \\n▁ in the meantime , his path was cleared , at least with leah . \\n▁ and that was all that was important . \\n▁ he , obviously , did n't tell her any of that . \\n▁ ` ` because the idea of doing it amuses me . '' \\n▁ she rolled her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he called and her gaze came to his . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll take your instruction seriously and i expect you to do the same . '' \\n▁ ` ` in case you had n't noticed , there 's no one to pass notes to here and i do n't have a phone so i can text my friends . '' \\n▁ he reached up a hand and slid his fingers through the soft hair on the side of her head . \\n▁ a mortal man might have missed the delicate shiver that slid across her skin at his touch . \\n▁ and a mortal would definitely miss the sudden racing of her heart . \\n▁ lucien did n't . \\n▁ this pleased him . \\n▁ greatly . \\n▁ he made no mention of it nor did he give her any indication he felt it . \\n▁ his eyes locked with hers . \\n▁ ` ` good , then i 'll have your undivided attention . '' \\n▁ ` ` can we get started ? '' \\n▁ she snapped . \\n▁ ` ` you 're very impatient , '' he told her , fighting a smile . \\n▁ her eyes darted to his mouth then away while she announced , ` ` i ' m a lot of things , none of them good . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve noticed you 're a lot of them , pet , but i beg to differ . \\n▁ i think all of them are good . '' \\n▁ she closed her eyes in despair while muttering , ` ` great . '' \\n▁ he chuckled and slid under her , pulling her over his body until she was mostly on top of him , part of her settled at his side against the back of the lounge . \\n▁ he kept his arms locked around her waist as she came up on a forearm and looked down at him . \\n▁ her thick hair fell in a curtain around her face , its fragrance enveloping him in an intoxicating mixture of peonies with a hint of grapefruit . \\n▁ he tamped down the urge to pull her hair and her closer and instead offered , ` ` we 'll start with last night , shall we ? '' \\n▁ ` ` finally , '' she breathed and he gave her a gentle but unmistakable squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he added a verbal warning to his physical one . \\n▁ she drew in a breath and exhaled loudly . \\n▁ then she invited , ` ` begin , oh great master . '' \\n▁ he again fought back a grin . \\n▁ ` ` you 're about to earn another hug . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're already hugging me . '' \\n▁ he let the feel of her , the vision of her and her divine aroma penetrate . \\n▁ he lost focus and one of his hands roamed up her spine as he murmured , ` ` indeed i am . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she called . \\n▁ ` ` you were going to impart great vampire wisdom on me ? '' \\n▁ he 'd rather kiss her . \\n▁ he 'd also rather peel away her clothes and taste her skin , her br * * sts , the heat between her legs . \\n▁ he did none of that no matter how much he wanted it . \\n▁ instead he told her , ` ` last night did n't go as i planned . '' \\n▁ he watched her press her lips together in an effort to bite back her own words . \\n▁ ` ` you made it get out of hand , pet , '' he said quietly and her brows shot up as she reflexively pushed against his chest , again to no avail . \\n▁ ` ` me ? '' \\n▁ she snapped when she 'd stopped pushing . \\n▁ ` ` you , '' he returned . \\n▁ ` ` how was i responsible for last night ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you got too excited . '' \\n▁ ` ` too … '' she paused and repeated , ` ` too … '' then she made a strangled noise , unable to continue . \\n▁ his hand slid further up her back , caught a lock of her hair and he started twisting it around his finger . \\n▁ ` ` you wanted me , '' he murmured and she swallowed . \\n▁ ` ` did not , '' she whispered her lie . \\n▁ ` ` you did , i smelled it . '' \\n▁ her eyes widened and her lips parted . \\n▁ lucien decided that was his favorite of leah 's many expressions . \\n▁ ` ` my senses are far more acute than yours , '' he explained . \\n▁ ` ` i know that . '' \\n▁ ` ` so you know i could smell your excitement . '' \\n▁ her eyes slid away and she muttered with embarrassment , ` ` i did n't know that . '' \\n▁ he found he was surprised at her embarrassment , delighted but surprised . \\n▁ even so , he sought to alleviate it . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted you too , '' he told her softly . \\n▁ her eyes slid back fleetingly , he saw pink rise in her cheeks and he heard her heart trip over itself . \\n▁ then she moved her gaze to study the arm of the lounge . \\n▁ his arm gave her a squeeze at her waist . \\n▁ ` ` look at me , pet . '' \\n▁ she hesitated and then did as he commanded . \\n▁ ` ` vampires are human , '' he informed her and instead of her lips parting , her mouth dropped open and she gaped at him . \\n▁ he continued despite her astonished reaction . \\n▁ ` ` the theory is , we mutated from homo sapiens a long time ago . \\n▁ as the millennia passed , we developed necessary traits , instincts , abilities for our survival and for the survival of the species that would keep us alive . '' \\n▁ she continued to stare at him then whispered , ` ` you 're human ? '' \\n▁ ` ` a kind of human , yes , the immortal kind . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's not dark magic ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head and said , ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` supernatural ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` paranormal ? '' \\n▁ ` ` leah , i ' m just like you , except different . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , you 're way different ! \\n▁ you suck human blood ! '' \\n▁ her voice had risen and she tried to pull away but he stopped twisting her hair and drew her closer with both arms wrapped around her . \\n▁ ` ` we feed on human blood , yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's wrong . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's natural . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's crazy ! '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's been happening since time began . '' \\n▁ she shook her head looking anywhere but at him visibly unable to process this information . \\n▁ ` ` this is nuts , '' she muttered with an edge of hysteria . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't . '' \\n▁ finally she looked at him . \\n▁ ` ` it 's sick . '' \\n▁ his arms tightened further and he held control of his temper but his voice betrayed it when he explained , ` ` you should know , that 's offensive , pet . '' \\n▁ her eyes skittered away and she accused his shoulder , ` ` you move faster than anyone i ' ve ever seen . \\n▁ that is not natural . '' \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve never been with a vampire . '' \\n▁ ` ` you smell things , hear things - '' he cut her off , ` ` leah , this is n't difficult to understand . '' \\n▁ her eyes shot to his . \\n▁ ` ` easy for you to say ! '' \\n▁ ` ` species have been evolving since the planet formed . \\n▁ it 's entirely natural , what i can do , how i feed . \\n▁ it 's who i am . \\n▁ it 's the way of my people . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't believe this , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` it 's true . '' \\n▁ she studied him briefly , her eyes working , her thoughts shifting , wildly different expressions swiftly drifting across her features , settling on one . \\n▁ distrust mingled with horror . \\n▁ ` ` so , what , we 're your prey ? \\n▁ my people , that is . \\n▁ in this ` natural world ' of yours . '' \\n▁ he did n't hesitate with his reply , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ she went still and stared at him , clearly stunned at both his answer and his honesty . \\n▁ he took advantage . \\n▁ ` ` what i have n't explained yet is there 's more we can do . \\n▁ something i did n't do last night . \\n▁ something that would have made things go far better for you if you had n't made me lose control . '' \\n▁ she gritted her teeth at another mention of her responsibility for last night 's events before asking , ` ` and that would be ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i can xxunk your skin . '' \\n▁ her body jerked before she said , ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` before feeding , only before feeding , my saliva has a numbing agent that releases . \\n▁ not only does it xxunk , it has healing properties . \\n▁ strong ones . \\n▁ the healing begins even before i finish feeding . '' \\n▁ leah blinked , the distrust and horror gone , confusion and disbelief in its place . \\n▁ lucien went on , ` ` if i 'd have prepared you before we started , you would n't have felt the tearing , just the feeding , which is highly pleasurable for mortals . '' \\n▁ her face instantly assumed the look he enjoyed , the one filled with wonder . \\n▁ then she said , ` ` you 're joking . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` your people find it a sensual experience . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she shook her head , pushed up again , got nowhere and gave up , collapsing against him . \\n▁ ` ` i was wrong about what you said before . \\n▁ that was n't nuts . \\n▁ this is nuts . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is n't . '' \\n▁ she ignored him and her eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` so why did n't you … prepare me ? '' \\n▁ his arm at her waist circled further . \\n▁ his other hand slid up her neck and into her hair , bringing her face closer . \\n▁ quietly , he explained , ` ` you were excited , moving against me , agitated , aroused . \\n▁ you felt good . \\n▁ you smelled good , '' his voice dipped lower at the memory , ` ` so f * * king good i lost control . '' \\n▁ her head pressed against his hand and did n't stop even if her effort was futile . \\n▁ ` ` tomorrow night , when we do it again , i 'll prepare you , '' he murmured , his eyes dropping to her throat . \\n▁ she halted her struggles and he listened to her pulse as it raced . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she whispered . \\n▁ he lifted his gaze to lock on hers . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll like it . '' \\n▁ her voice held a tremor when she said , ` ` you said that last time . '' \\n▁ ` ` tomorrow , i wo n't be so hungry . \\n▁ tomorrow , i 'll take care of you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m supposed to trust that ? '' \\n▁ his voice was deadly serious when he replied , ` ` yes , leah . \\n▁ with feeding and with everything , you 're supposed to trust me . '' \\n▁ her head jerked against his hand and his fingers curled into her hair until it stilled . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't trust you , '' she snapped . \\n▁ ` ` you will , '' he returned . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` you will . '' \\n▁ ` ` never , '' she hissed , losing her shock and getting angry . \\n▁ damn , she was stubborn . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll have to prove it to you , '' he promised her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m never doing that again , '' she announced and his fingers in her hair twisted slightly as his patience slipped . \\n▁ ` ` you will , tomorrow night . '' \\n▁ his voice was implacable . \\n▁ ` ` over my dead body , '' she bit out , her eyes flashing , her insult crystal clear and he felt it slice agonizingly through his gut . \\n▁ ` ` not a chance , '' he clipped in return . \\n▁ she glared at him . \\n▁ he scowled back . \\n▁ she gave in first when she demanded to know , ` ` are we done with my lesson now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he growled . \\n▁ ` ` good , then you 're going to go ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ her body jolted again and she asked , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's answer to part two of your earlier question . \\n▁ i ' m not going . \\n▁ i ' m spending the night here . '' \\n▁ her eyes widened again when she asked , ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i like the smell of you when i sleep . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ she cried in horror . \\n▁ ` ` and the feel of you , '' he continued . \\n▁ she rolled her eyes toward her forehead and muttered , ` ` oh my god . \\n▁ it just gets worse and worse . '' \\n▁ he ignored her verbal non - prayer and called , ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ her eyes snapped back to his face and she was back to glaring . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be here every night . '' \\n▁ her nose wrinkled before she mumbled , ` ` yep . \\n▁ gets worse and worse . '' \\n▁ lucien decided he was done and it was time to move on . \\n▁ therefore he did so . \\n▁ ` ` now , you have three choices , '' he informed her . \\n▁ her head tilted and her jaw clenched before she gritted from between her teeth , ` ` and those are ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you can share a drink with me while i have dinner , yours being non - alcoholic . '' \\n▁ ` ` next , '' she snapped . \\n▁ ` ` you can get changed into your nightgown , get into bed and read . '' \\n▁ ` ` that sounds doable . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be joining you . '' \\n▁ ` ` next , '' she demanded immediately . \\n▁ ` ` last , you can begin your next lesson . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that would be ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be teaching you how i like to be kissed . '' \\n▁ her face paled and her body froze . \\n▁ after a long moment , she whispered , ` ` i 'll pick door number two . '' \\n▁ he lost his annoyance and his impatience instantly for that was his choice . \\n▁ although his choice was actually number three but he knew she was n't ready for that yet . \\n▁ his fingers unclenched in her hair and his hand cupped the back of her head , bringing her face closer to his . \\n▁ ` ` i said i picked door number two , lucien , '' she breathed , pushing her head against his hand . \\n▁ he pressed her ever forward until her mouth was a breath away from his . \\n▁ ` ` get changed . \\n▁ i need food , a word with edwina and i 'll meet you in bed . '' \\n▁ ` ` righty ho , oh great master . '' \\n▁ at her words , lucien changed his mind and decided her next lesson would be right now . \\n▁ and that lesson would be that you always respect a vampire . \\n▁ he brought her head forward a breath so her lips were light on his . \\n▁ ` ` this is your only warning , pet . \\n▁ if you call me ` oh great master ' again , i 'll be forced to punish you . '' \\n▁ she held his gaze defiantly , her mouth soft against his , her head pressing against his hand . \\n▁ seconds slid by . \\n▁ then , lucien was disheartened to see , she stopped her struggles and he watched her eyelids slowly drop in defeat . \\n▁ a scant second later , her lids lifted , her eyes flared and she whispered passionately against his mouth , ` ` god , i hate you . '' \\n▁ he smiled against her lips . \\n▁ yes , he was right , she was utterly enchanting . \\n▁ chapter six the kiss my eyes opened to a wall of sleek skin over the hard muscle of a massive chest . \\n▁ i stared at it , confused . \\n▁ justin had chest hair . \\n▁ did he shave his chest ? \\n▁ and was he working out , like , a lot ? \\n▁ then i remembered that this was n't justin . \\n▁ justin was long gone . \\n▁ four months gone . \\n▁ this was lucien . \\n▁ lucien who had left me last night to get food and have a word with edwina . \\n▁ lucien who had come back half an hour later carrying an expensive looking , black leather bag that appeared full . \\n▁ lucien who had disappeared into the bathroom and come out ten minutes later wearing nothing but a pair of black , drawstring pajama bottoms , giving me the first - ever view of his bulging biceps , sinewy forearms , broad shoulders , defined collarbone and honed chest which narrowed into a six pack . \\n▁ no kidding , he was perfect from the top of his head to his waist . \\n▁ every inch . \\n▁ i quit breathing and tried not to drool . \\n▁ he totally sensed my reaction . \\n▁ i knew this because his eyes went hooded and he grinned . \\n▁ my first reaction was to pant when his eyes went all vampire sexy like that . \\n▁ my second reaction was vastly different . \\n▁ i resisted -lrb- barely -rrb- the urge to throw my book at him . \\n▁ he got in bed beside me . \\n▁ i ignored him , turning my back to him and concentrating on my book , one page of which i read fifteen times before it sunk in . \\n▁ i did n't know what lucien did . \\n▁ i did n't look . \\n▁ i think he read because i heard pages turning . \\n▁ he did n't touch me though and finally i turned out my light and tried to sleep . \\n▁ he did n't . \\n▁ he kept doing whatever it was he was doing for a good long while keeping his light on . \\n▁ eventually this forced me to ask irritably , ` ` are you ever going to turn out your light ? '' \\n▁ ` ` in a minute , my pet . '' \\n▁ god , i hated it when he called me his ` ` pet '' . \\n▁ it was way too close to the bone . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't get to sleep with the light on , '' i informed him xxunk , still with my back to him , speaking to the opposite wall . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll learn , '' he replied casually . \\n▁ i clamped my mouth shut . \\n▁ then i lay there and seethed . \\n▁ lucien took his time which i thought was incredibly inconsiderate . \\n▁ finally , he turned out his light . \\n▁ i began to force myself to relax . \\n▁ this effort was immediately rendered futile when he pulled me into him , the length of my back pressed to the length of his front and his arm tight around me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not a xxunk , '' i shared . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll learn that too , '' he returned . \\n▁ what a jerk ! \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' i started . \\n▁ he cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` quiet , leah , i ' m tired . '' \\n▁ he said this like he expected me to obey without question . \\n▁ which i supposed he did . \\n▁ and worse , i had pretty much no choice but to do so . \\n▁ ` ` my life sucks , '' i announced into the dark . \\n▁ he chuckled into the hair at the back of my head . \\n▁ i did n't know when he fell asleep . \\n▁ i did n't even know when i did . \\n▁ i just knew i did because now i was facing him , staring at his glorious chest . \\n▁ i had to get out of there . \\n▁ my body tensed for flight . \\n▁ the instant it did , his hand came up , grasped a handful of hair and tugged it down , forcing my head back . \\n▁ i looked up into his still - drowsy face and caught my breath . \\n▁ i hated him but there was no denying he was gorgeous , especially in the morning with that still - drowsy face . \\n▁ his head was tilting toward me and before i could process the meaning behind his movement , his mouth was on mine . \\n▁ this surprised me . \\n▁ not that he would kiss me because the detail to my job description was pretty freaking clear . \\n▁ no , what surprised me was that the kiss was soft , gentle , exploratory , not hard , demanding and invasive . \\n▁ i was so surprised i did n't even think to pull free . \\n▁ his lips moved on mine in sensual discovery , his head slanting ever so slightly to press deeper . \\n▁ it was nice , stirring me but not frightening me . \\n▁ i felt him then , the heat from his body , the soft skin over strong muscle of his chest under my hands . \\n▁ that was nice too . \\n▁ his hand at my hip slid to the small of my back , just above my bottom and it pressed in . \\n▁ more heat , more hardness , more pressure on my mouth , all of it controlled but delicious . \\n▁ without a thought i helped , wriggling to get closer , liking what i was feeling . \\n▁ his mouth opened over mine and , as if it was the most natural thing in the world , mine opened under his . \\n▁ his tongue slid inside . \\n▁ in a flash all gentle exploration was gone . \\n▁ the minute his tongue touched mine , my body exploded . \\n▁ my stomach dropped , my toes curled , my ni * * les hardened and i felt a wave of fire rush between my legs . \\n▁ it was fantastic . \\n▁ helpless to stop myself and not even trying , i pressed into him full body , trying to get as close as i could . \\n▁ even though i was lying down , both of my hands slid up his chest and held onto his shoulders tightly like if i did n't , i would fall . \\n▁ at my touch , he growled low in the back of his throat , the power of it vibrating through my mouth , against my tongue and i lost it . \\n▁ not that i had much of ` ` it '' to lose . \\n▁ one of my hands pushed under his arm , wrapping around his back . \\n▁ the other one curled around his neck and up , gliding into his thick , soft hair . \\n▁ he rolled into me , slanting his head further , deepening the kiss , his hand at my back sliding over my bottom , cupping me , pressing in . \\n▁ our tongues tangled and he tasted beautiful . \\n▁ i 'd never tasted anyone -lrb- especially in the morning -rrb- that amazing . \\n▁ i liked it . \\n▁ i craved it . \\n▁ i wanted more and i took it . \\n▁ i took it like i needed it , like my life had a limit and if i did n't get as much of it as i could , i 'd quit breathing the next instant . \\n▁ he felt my urgency and rolled me fully to my back , his weight pinning me , his h * ps grinding into mine so i could feel his arousal . \\n▁ my body answered with another luscious belly drop and rush of warmth at my core . \\n▁ my hand clenched in his hair and i did n't care if it hurt . \\n▁ i was going to hold him to me for as long as it took me to get my fill of that mind - blowing kiss . \\n▁ suddenly his mouth tore from mine . \\n▁ his head went up and cocked slightly to the side . \\n▁ i did not like this . \\n▁ i held his hair clenched in my fist , my body squirming under his to resurrect our contact , my breath coming in fast pants . \\n▁ ` ` we ' ve company , '' he murmured , his eyes dark and unfocused , a strange look of annoyance on his features . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i breathed . \\n▁ he looked down at me and when he did his face gentled . \\n▁ ` ` company , '' he repeated and i did n't process this . \\n▁ i could n't . \\n▁ my concentration was entirely centered on his mouth , his eyes , his face , his body , his hardness , his heat and the intense , altogether too pleasant feeling between my legs . \\n▁ his face dipped closer and my mind and body rejoiced . \\n▁ but he did n't kiss me -lrb- alas -rrb- . \\n▁ instead , his hand came to cup my jaw and he muttered , ` ` i ca n't tell you how much it pleases me that you need no instruction on how to kiss me like i like it . '' \\n▁ this pleased me too . \\n▁ intensely . \\n▁ considering i hated him with every fiber of my being this also confused me . \\n▁ just as intensely . \\n▁ and , considering i hated him with a depth that was scary , this also pissed me off , at myself . \\n▁ even more intensely . \\n▁ before i could come to terms with any of this , his mouth brushed mine then he whispered , ` ` i 'll be back . '' \\n▁ in a flash , he was out of bed . \\n▁ he hesitated at its side , looking down at me . \\n▁ i blinked , still not used to how quickly he could move not to mention the sight of his chest . \\n▁ i watched his face grow hard and he ordered , ` ` do n't move . '' \\n▁ then he was out the door . \\n▁ i lay in bed wondering what in the hell just happened . \\n▁ my body did n't wonder . \\n▁ it knew what happened . \\n▁ it liked what happened . \\n▁ it wanted more of what happened . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' i breathed aloud . \\n▁ i was deranged . \\n▁ i liked being kissed by a vampire . \\n▁ worse ! \\n▁ i liked being kissed by lucien , the big , bad , jerky , controlling vampire . \\n▁ i 'd lost my mind . \\n▁ then it hit me that i had company . \\n▁ how could i have company ? \\n▁ no one knew where i lived . \\n▁ even i was n't certain where i lived considering a driver picked me up at the airport and brought me here . \\n▁ i was too busy lamenting my sucky life to pay attention to where we were going . \\n▁ ignoring his order not to move , i threw back the covers and stood . \\n▁ this caused me to feel a wave of dizziness . \\n▁ clearly , i had n't fully recovered from his onslaught at the bloodletting . \\n▁ i let my head adjust and then i hurried to the bathroom . \\n▁ grabbing my short , creamy - colored flannel robe off the hook on the back of the door , i shrugged it on and rushed out of the room . \\n▁ tying the belt as i went , i ran as fast as my legs would carry me without passing out and doing myself bodily harm . \\n▁ i flew around the landing . \\n▁ as i was descending the last flight of stairs , right in front of me at the door , i saw lucien 's powerfully muscled back in his pajama bottoms . \\n▁ i also saw he was holding himself rigid , why , i did n't know . \\n▁ probably anger or frustration . \\n▁ i also saw he was facing my aunties kate , millicent and nadia , all of whom were standing just inside the door . \\n▁ hallelujah ! \\n▁ before i was all the way to the bottom and opened my mouth to speak , lucien 's torso twisted so he was facing me . \\n▁ i caught the look on his face and realized it was n't anger or frustration . \\n▁ it was fury . \\n▁ i did n't get to greet my family . \\n▁ lucien spoke first . \\n▁ ` ` what did i tell you ? '' \\n▁ he demanded , his voice so harsh it was a whiplash . \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ i asked , stopping two steps from the bottom in an effort at self - preservation . \\n▁ i hoped distance would help me avoid the almost physical lash of his tongue . \\n▁ ` ` what did i tell you ? '' \\n▁ he repeated , turning slowly to me . \\n▁ my eyes flickered to my aunties who were looking pale and concerned , their own gazes moving between lucien and me . \\n▁ ` ` get back upstairs , '' lucien went on when i did n't reply . \\n▁ i looked back to him and said , what i thought was logically , ` ` but , my aunts are - '' i did n't finish . \\n▁ i found myself over his shoulder and in the bedroom where he tossed me on the bed . \\n▁ this happened so fast the only thing i could feel was the wind created by his movement . \\n▁ i bounced on the bed once , twice , staring up at him . \\n▁ then i said in a furious whisper , ` ` you did not just - '' lucien interrupted me . \\n▁ ` ` do n't move . '' \\n▁ rage engulfed me , i got to my feet , standing on the bed and shouted , ` ` do n't you dare tell me - '' he cut me off again , this time using mind control . \\n▁ lie down , leah . \\n▁ i fought it . \\n▁ well , my mind did . \\n▁ this lasted about three seconds . \\n▁ xxunk quickly , i lay down on the bed . \\n▁ get comfortable , he ordered and i did as i was told as best as i could when i was struggling against my mind which was in his stranglehold . \\n▁ do n't make a noise and do n't f * * king move , he finished and , without further ado , he left . \\n▁ i lay on the bed motionless but comfortable as the minutes passed . \\n▁ there were a goodly number of them before he returned . \\n▁ i had no idea where my aunties were or why they were even here . \\n▁ i had no idea what was going on . \\n▁ the only thing i knew was that i hated him now more than ever . \\n▁ he sat on the side of the bed . \\n▁ my eyes watched him do this and i screamed my hatred at him in my head as he tugged me across the bed and into his lap . \\n▁ i did n't struggle . \\n▁ i did n't because i could n't move . \\n▁ his eyes locked on mine . \\n▁ ` ` you must learn to mind me . '' \\n▁ go to hell ! \\n▁ my mind shouted . \\n▁ he shook his head and cradled me closer , speaking softly , ` ` you need to learn this lesson , pet . '' \\n▁ fuck off and do n't call me pet ! \\n▁ my mind shrieked . \\n▁ he held my body in his arms and my glare with his calm gaze as i tried desperately to shoot laser beams out of my eyes and annihilate him . \\n▁ this , unfortunately , did not work . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll not countenance disobedience . '' \\n▁ he kept speaking softly . \\n▁ no duh ? \\n▁ my mind asked sarcastically . \\n▁ he sighed then stated , ` ` leah , if you defy me again , especially if you do it in front of others , you 'll be punished . '' \\n▁ do your worst ! \\n▁ my mind challenged . \\n▁ it ca n't be worse than what you ' ve already done . \\n▁ he stopped using his voice and instead spoke directly to my mind . \\n▁ you ' ve no idea . \\n▁ dazzle me , my mind snapped . \\n▁ our eyes locked for long moments before he took up my challenge . \\n▁ as you wish . \\n▁ tonight , i feed . \\n▁ then your punishment begins . \\n▁ i ca n't wait , i lied . \\n▁ i could definitely wait . \\n▁ this whole thing was freaking me out . \\n▁ he looked angry but resigned as he muttered , ` ` stubborn . '' \\n▁ my mind stayed silent . \\n▁ ` ` your punishment will be just as difficult for me as it is for you , leah . '' \\n▁ good ! \\n▁ my mind ground out . \\n▁ his eyes moved over my face , the anger drifted out of his and i could swear he looked almost pleased . \\n▁ ` ` one thing about you , pet , you are n't a disappointment . '' \\n▁ i had no idea what he meant by that and thus did n't have a retort . \\n▁ i felt my mind freed , my body at my command again and i did n't hesitate . \\n▁ i scrambled off his lap and backed swiftly away as he rose from the side of the bed . \\n▁ ` ` can my lesson tonight be how you kill vampires ? '' \\n▁ i asked in an ugly voice . \\n▁ shockingly , lucien replied instantly , ` ` burn to nothing but ash then scatter the remains . '' \\n▁ ` ` well then , lucien , you better get edwina to hide the f * * king matches , '' i retorted and without another word i turned on my heel and ran into the bathroom , slamming the door and locking it . \\n▁ i put my back to it , drifting down to my ass . \\n▁ i rested my forehead to my knees and realized i was in full body tremble . \\n▁ god , i hated him . \\n▁ * * * * * this was the rest of my xxunk - blank day : first , i had to come out of the bathroom . \\n▁ i could n't live there , as much as i wanted to at that moment . \\n▁ there was water but there was no food and i was hungry . \\n▁ when i did the bed had been made and edwina was setting the table between the armchairs with plates and cutlery . \\n▁ she turned to me , all perky housekeeper , and smiled , asking , ` ` and how are we this morning ? '' \\n▁ ` ` murderous , '' i replied . \\n▁ her body twitched and her head tilted to the side in that weird birdlike manner of hers . \\n▁ she took a moment to study me . \\n▁ ` ` i see you 're not in a very good mood again , '' she observed . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i. am . \\n▁ not , '' i retorted . \\n▁ ` ` where 's lucien ? '' \\n▁ ` ` here , '' he declared , sauntering in coolly like he had n't just humbled me , kept me from my family , shackled me with his mind . \\n▁ ` ` you have n't left yet ? '' \\n▁ i snapped out my question . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m showering , we 're sharing breakfast then i ' m leaving . '' \\n▁ it was on the tip of my tongue to tell him to get a move on when i realized edwina was still in the room . \\n▁ not wanting a repeat of twenty minutes ago , i pressed my lips together and wrapped my arms around my middle . \\n▁ lucien watched me do this then , as he walked to the bathroom , he mumbled , ` ` you 're learning . '' \\n▁ i turned to edwina and asked , ` ` do we have any lighter fluid ? '' \\n▁ edwina 's brows shot up to her hairline as i heard lucien 's bark of laughter from the bathroom cut off in mid - rumble as he shut the door . \\n▁ this made my hands clench into fists . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think so , dear , '' edwina answered , confused at the question and the byplay . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you should put it on your grocery list , '' i suggested . \\n▁ ` ` are you planning a barbeque ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i answered . \\n▁ ` ` a big one . '' \\n▁ that 's when i heard lucien 's second bark of laughter . \\n▁ damn the vampire . \\n▁ * * * * * lucien and i shared breakfast . \\n▁ we sat in the armchairs in my bedroom and he calmly ate while reading the paper as i made another attempt to get laser beams to shoot out of my eyes . \\n▁ it goes without saying i failed in this endeavor . \\n▁ unable to take the silence , i asked , ` ` why are we eating in the bedroom ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because i want to , '' he replied . \\n▁ ` ` but why ? '' \\n▁ i pushed . \\n▁ his eyes locked on mine in a way that said i was testing him and i definitely should n't . \\n▁ ` ` sorry for questioning you , my lord and master , '' i muttered , shoving more of edwina 's delicious french toast into my mouth , deciding if i gained one hundred pounds -lrb- which i could , no sweat -rrb- , he would n't want me anymore . \\n▁ ` ` i think i explained how i feel about your sarcastic titles , leah , '' lucien reminded me . \\n▁ i looked at him and chewed . \\n▁ after i swallowed , i informed him , ` ` you said i could n't call you ` oh great master ' . '' \\n▁ he watched me for a long moment before he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` you are correct , '' he allowed . \\n▁ ` ` so now i 'll tell you i wo n't tolerate any of your sarcastic titles . '' \\n▁ i twirled my fork in the air , looking down at my plate , saying , ` ` whatever . '' \\n▁ more silence then lucien folded the paper and threw it on the table . \\n▁ i looked up , hopeful he was finished so i could put in action the plan i 'd hatched in the bathroom . \\n▁ he was watching me . \\n▁ ` ` a package will arrive today , '' he started and i nodded because his plate was clean and i took this as a good sign . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll be wearing what 's in the package when i arrive home tonight . '' \\n▁ my mind was skittering across a thousand images of me in different types of bondage gear . \\n▁ therefore i missed his swift movement from seated to standing and pulling my chair around so he could lean into me , a hand on each arm . \\n▁ ` ` did you hear me ? '' \\n▁ i glared at him and replied acidly , ` ` yes , darling . '' \\n▁ something flashed in his eyes , something strange , something that looked like exhilaration . \\n▁ his eyes dropped to my mouth and he murmured , ` ` i like that . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you calling me ` darling ' . '' \\n▁ what an idiot i was ! \\n▁ i decided instantly never to call him that again . \\n▁ he read my mind , his hand came to my neck and he ordered , ` ` i want you to call me that from now on . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're ordering me to call you ` darling ' ? '' \\n▁ i asked with disbelief . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's crazy ! '' \\n▁ i protested . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll do it , '' he demanded . \\n▁ i looked to the ceiling and muttered , ` ` i ' m such an idiot . '' \\n▁ since i was looking at the ceiling , his mouth brushing mine came as a surprise . \\n▁ when my eyes rolled to his , i could see close up his were smiling . \\n▁ ` ` you 're adorable , '' he whispered . \\n▁ and with that , he left . \\n▁ and with that , i was left with wondering how i could detest a being so much and still feel a little thrill at his calling me adorable and his giving me a brush on the lips . \\n▁ * * * * * my plan to escape was thwarted . \\n▁ see , i 'd decided to let lucien hunt me down and kill me . \\n▁ i did n't want to die . \\n▁ i also did n't think he 'd do it . \\n▁ kill me that was . \\n▁ it seemed , weirdly enough , he actually liked me in his freakish vampire way . \\n▁ when he found me -lrb- and he would -rrb- , i was counting on the fact he 'd give into me pleading for my life , figure out i was more of a pain in the ass than i was worth , he 'd release me and i 'd be on my way . \\n▁ it was a ludicrous plan hatched in a hysterically angry frame of mind . \\n▁ however , my day turned out rather busy and i never had the chance to put it into action . \\n▁ first up , i tried to get edwina to tell me if she knew what happened with my aunties . \\n▁ she said she did n't know . \\n▁ i did n't know her enough to know if she was lying or not but i let it go . \\n▁ next , i started to plan my getaway . \\n▁ obviously , i 'd need cash , credit cards and identification . \\n▁ so , logically , i started with my purse . \\n▁ there i found the dread , detested lucien had not only confiscated my phone ; he 'd also taken my wallet and my passport . \\n▁ the bastard . \\n▁ that was okay . \\n▁ i had a few pieces of jewelry that were worth some money . \\n▁ i 'd pawn them to get some cash . \\n▁ i went to the drawer in my dressing table that had an inbuilt , velvet lined jewelry section . \\n▁ my jewelry was gone . \\n▁ damn ! \\n▁ what ? \\n▁ did he read my mind at breakfast ? \\n▁ undeterred , i decided just to go . \\n▁ upon examining the house two days ago , i 'd also examined the garage and saw the cayenne which edwina told me lucien had bought for me . \\n▁ i could sell the cayenne for a shed load of money . \\n▁ upon thoroughly searching and eventually asking edwina , i found there were no keys . \\n▁ lucien had taken them . \\n▁ ` ` he 's concerned about you , dear , '' edwina explained what she thought was the truth . \\n▁ ` ` you were n't steady on your feet yesterday . \\n▁ you need a bit of time to get settled in and it wo n't help to go gallivanting around the countryside . '' \\n▁ after offering that pearl of wisdom , she flitted away . \\n▁ i was glaring at her back while considering loading the silver in a pillowcase and hitchhiking to the nearest town when the next thing happened . \\n▁ the doorbell rang and edwina and i both reached it at the same time . \\n▁ me hoping it was my aunties or better yet , my mom . \\n▁ edwina knowing who it was . \\n▁ it was two men who came bearing lots and lots of boxes . \\n▁ edwina was obviously expecting this and although she acted a little bit weirded out about it but did n't share why , she started to order them around as to where the boxes went . \\n▁ when the men took some into the bedroom , i followed them and edwina was waiting for them in the dressing room . \\n▁ without hesitation she tore one open and started to pull out the things in the box . \\n▁ the things in the box , by the way , were men 's clothes . \\n▁ expensive , well - tailored , designer - label men 's clothes that looked like they would fit lucien . \\n▁ there were a lot of clothes . \\n▁ i wandered out of the dressing room and down the stairs and saw other boxes were being placed in other rooms . \\n▁ mostly the study . \\n▁ i stood amongst this hubbub , perplexed . \\n▁ was he moving in ? \\n▁ i mean , i was pretty certain rafe did n't live with lana . \\n▁ i was equally pretty certain that duncan did n't live with my cousin natalie . \\n▁ by the way , i 'd learned natalie 's -lrb- my favorite cousin -rrb- vampire 's name was duncan after my selection , when i learned all my cousin 's vampire 's names . \\n▁ i had six cousins , four of them selected , two of them not yet . \\n▁ all of them , i was pretty certain , did n't live with their vampires . \\n▁ furthermore , i was sure my mother did n't live with cosmo . \\n▁ as i was standing in the hall watching the men go back out to their truck to get even more boxes , stephanie waltzed in the opened door . \\n▁ she looked fantastic in a royal blue satin blouse and matching skirt that fit her like a second skin and hit her at her knees . \\n▁ her high - heeled , royal blue , strappy sandals were , no other words for it , the bomb . \\n▁ as a woman , regardless of my current tumultuous state - of - being , i could n't stop myself from crying , ` ` i love your outfit ! '' \\n▁ she put her hands out and smiled . \\n▁ ` ` fab , is n't it ? \\n▁ we 'll get lucien 's card and i 'll take you to the shop where i got it , kit you out . '' \\n▁ my pleasure at her outfit disappeared and i wrinkled my nose . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think so , '' i said . \\n▁ she got close , her brows drawn , a small smile playing at her mouth . \\n▁ ` ` why 's that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want anything from lucien , '' i announced grandly . \\n▁ for some unhinged reason this made her laugh out loud like i was hilarious . \\n▁ then , eyes on me , she whispered , ` ` god , i envy him . '' \\n▁ boy , vampires were weird . \\n▁ suddenly something occurred to me and i looked out at the blazing sun stephanie had just walked through to get to the house . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't be in the sun ! '' \\n▁ i shouted and it sounded like an accusation . \\n▁ she asked through a chuckle , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you , '' i stated , pointing at her , ` ` just walked through the sun . '' \\n▁ i pointed out the door before dropping my hand . \\n▁ ` ` i thought sunshine was deadly to vampires . '' \\n▁ confusion washed through her face before she muttered to herself , ` ` vampire studies are n't what they used to be . '' \\n▁ ` ` i was expelled , '' i divulged . \\n▁ her beautiful blue eyes widened then she threw back her head and laughed , uproariously i might add , all the while coming toward me and sliding her arm around my waist . \\n▁ she moved me forward into the family room where she seated us facing on the couch . \\n▁ ` ` vampires are human , '' she told me . \\n▁ i waved my hand between us and said , ` ` i know that . \\n▁ lucien explained that last night . '' \\n▁ ` ` sun is n't deadly to us . '' \\n▁ i did n't know that but i did n't share mainly because she already knew i did n't know that from my reaction . \\n▁ she went on , ` ` we were nocturnal , back in the day . \\n▁ that 's how that rumor got started . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' i said just for something to say . \\n▁ this made sense . \\n▁ actually it all made sense which was a little disappointing . \\n▁ i 'd prefer it was dark magic or something sinister and evil . \\n▁ it would give me something else to put in my why i hate lucien vault . \\n▁ ` ` so , you obviously are n't nocturnal now , '' i remarked . \\n▁ ` ` some still keep to the old ways . '' \\n▁ she leaned in and grinned . \\n▁ ` ` personally , i never wake up before at least noon . '' \\n▁ we heard the men come back in . \\n▁ she looked over her shoulder at the door then at me and asked , ` ` what 's with the boxes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it appears lucien is moving in , '' i replied , unable to hide my distaste for this idea . \\n▁ she looked over her shoulder at the door again and again mumbled under her breath , ` ` he sure does n't waste any time . '' \\n▁ ` ` waste any time what ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ she looked back to me and answered , ` ` i 'll let lucien explain it . '' \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` stephanie , no disrespect , but i 'd rather you did the explaining . '' \\n▁ her eyes softened and she said quietly , ` ` i take it things are n't going well between you two . '' \\n▁ ` ` nope , '' i replied instantly . \\n▁ ` ` did he not feed ? '' \\n▁ she asked , sounding slightly incredulous . \\n▁ ` ` yep . \\n▁ he fed , '' i shared . \\n▁ ` ` things got out of hand and he forgot to xxunk me , '' i waved my hand in the air , ` ` or whatever . '' \\n▁ i watched her face shut down and realized it was to mask her reaction . \\n▁ then her hand came out and grabbed mine before she whispered in a voice that dripped compassion , ` ` oh honey . '' \\n▁ at her words and the tone in which they were uttered i wanted to cry . \\n▁ i really did . \\n▁ she obviously understood even if it was from her viewpoint , not the victim 's . \\n▁ it was good sitting across from someone , even someone i barely knew , who understood . \\n▁ but i did n't cry . \\n▁ i felt the tears welling but i held them back . \\n▁ it took a lot out of me but i f * * king well did it . \\n▁ she watched my struggle and when i 'd come out victorious she gave my hand a firm squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` you need to get drunk , '' she declared , taking her hand away . \\n▁ i thought that was an excellent idea . \\n▁ then i remembered why it might not be an excellent idea . \\n▁ ` ` lucien said he 's feeding again tonight . '' \\n▁ she stood and pulled me up with her . \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ it 'll serve him right to get some secondhand alcohol in his system , '' she commented with feeling and leaned into me while she walked me from the room . \\n▁ ` ` feeding from someone inebriated , '' she gave a mock shudder , ` ` tastes crap . '' \\n▁ at learning that knowledge , i liked her plan all the better . \\n▁ * * * * * stephanie and i were hanging off the stools that sat around the huge island bar that separated the enormous kitchen from the breakfast nook and comfy - kitchen - living - area . \\n▁ yes , i had a comfy - kitchen - living - area with a big , fluffy couch , an attractive , low coffee table and a gigantic , round bean bag that two small adults could pile themselves into . \\n▁ who needs all that ? \\n▁ i already had a living room and family room for goodness sakes ! \\n▁ both stephanie and i had consumed more than our fair share of vodka martinis under the watchful and reproachful -lrb- i might add -rrb- eyes of edwina when the next thing happened . \\n▁ more boxes arrived . \\n▁ these were n't cardboard boxes filled with lucien 's clothes . \\n▁ these were glossy black boxes of all shapes and sizes , each of them tied with a blood - red satin bow . \\n▁ the minute stephanie eyed the delivery man carrying a tower of boxes , she cried , ` ` yippee ! \\n▁ lucien 's been shopping . '' \\n▁ this news did not make me happy . \\n▁ ` ` oh , my dear . \\n▁ you may be moody but you must have pleased him somehow , '' edwina pronounced having lost her stern glare and donning a gleaming smile . \\n▁ she was following delivery man number two . \\n▁ i ignored edwina and watched stephanie who was already digging into the stash with an abandon that was slightly scary . \\n▁ he 'd said a package would arrive . \\n▁ a package . \\n▁ did he expect me to wear all this stuff at once ? \\n▁ stephanie pulled out a flash of material , swinging it around and then smoothing it against her front . \\n▁ ` ` this is stunning . \\n▁ come here , leah , try this on , '' she demanded . \\n▁ i looked at what she held . \\n▁ she was right . \\n▁ it was stunning . \\n▁ it was the most exquisite thing i 'd ever seen . \\n▁ an evening dress , black matte silk , flowy skirt with a slit up the front lined in xxunk satin , halter - topped and backless . \\n▁ both delivery men came in again , each bearing another tower of boxes . \\n▁ ` ` more ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ stephanie did n't hear me or ignored me , likely the second , she was on a mission . \\n▁ ` ` come here , leah . \\n▁ this first , '' she was shaking the black gown at me , ` ` then this . '' \\n▁ she picked up what looked like a cream - colored skirt lined in pale blue and it had a kick xxunk . \\n▁ i slid off my stool and drunkenly wobbled into the comfy - kitchen - living area . \\n▁ i touched the fabric of the black gown . \\n▁ it was glorious . \\n▁ stephanie let it go to turn her attention to another box and i caught it before it fell to the ground . \\n▁ i held the dress up in front of me . \\n▁ i really wanted to enjoy this . \\n▁ i really , really did . \\n▁ but instead it made me feel more trapped , more suffocated , more owned . \\n▁ lucien was dressing up his pet . \\n▁ and i was his pet . \\n▁ it made me feel somehow dirty . \\n▁ ` ` why on earth would he buy me this stuff ? \\n▁ i 'll never wear it , '' i mumbled or , i should say , slurred . \\n▁ we 'd had a lot of martinis . \\n▁ stephanie paused in her gleeful activity and looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` what do you mean , you 'll never wear it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i live in a house in the middle of nowhere . \\n▁ my job is to hang around until a vampire wants to feed from me . '' \\n▁ stephanie straightened and caught my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` yes , that 's part of your job . \\n▁ another part of your job is to play escort should he want to show you off . \\n▁ at the opera . \\n▁ or a dinner party . \\n▁ or a feast . '' \\n▁ god , i hoped lucien did n't like opera . \\n▁ that would suck because i loathed it . \\n▁ i decided to latch onto something else she said , something lucien had mentioned before . \\n▁ ` ` a feast ? '' \\n▁ she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` a feast . \\n▁ some vamps take their concubines to feasts . \\n▁ i do n't but i know on occasion that lucien does . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's a feast ? '' \\n▁ i asked and edwina made a little pip noise and both stephanie and i swung our eyes to her . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't approve ? '' \\n▁ stephanie asked , not dangerously , curiously . \\n▁ ` ` not to his taking the girls there , no , '' edwina answered softly then started to gather up discarded tissue , ribbons and boxes . \\n▁ ` ` they can get dangerous . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's a feast ? '' \\n▁ i asked again but stephanie was still studying edwina . \\n▁ ` ` lucien would never let anything happen to one of his concubines . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' edwina said and straightened . \\n▁ ` ` it 's just … '' she hesitated , looked between us and finished , proclaiming , ` ` my girls are good girls . '' \\n▁ this made me even more intrigued so i asked , louder this time , ` ` what 's a feast ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she may need another martini for this , '' edwina mumbled , dropped the detritus and headed to the martini shaker . \\n▁ i was no longer intrigued , i was now concerned . \\n▁ so much so i plonked down on the fluffy couch amidst a mountain of tissue paper as the two delivery men added two more towers of boxes to the plethora . \\n▁ stephanie plonked down beside me and edwina fetched us fresh martinis . \\n▁ then stephanie explained . \\n▁ ` ` vamps can feed from two places , their concubines and any mortal who attends a feast . \\n▁ that 's it . \\n▁ that 's the law . '' \\n▁ ` ` so why are they dangerous ? \\n▁ do they round up the victims … ? '' \\n▁ i stopped speaking when stephanie 's face grew scary hard . \\n▁ ` ` they are n't victims , leah . \\n▁ they choose to be there . '' \\n▁ her voice was as hard as her face . \\n▁ i ignored her voice mainly because i could n't imagine what she said was true . \\n▁ she studied my expression and her face softened . \\n▁ ` ` it 's not like it was with you and lucien , '' she said under her breath so edwina , who was tidying my new , extravagant wardrobe , could n't hear . \\n▁ ` ` most mortals love it . \\n▁ some even become addicted to it . \\n▁ there are even ex - concubines there . '' \\n▁ i felt my eyes grow round and she nodded and continued , ` ` it 's frowned upon , of course . \\n▁ a concubine will lose her or his reputation by attending feasts after they ' ve been released . \\n▁ their families are normally shunned . \\n▁ their line will henceforth go xxunk at selections . \\n▁ they usually do n't attend once a concubine falls mostly because they are n't invited . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` feasts are where common mortals go . '' \\n▁ she put her hand on mine . \\n▁ ` ` you , honey , are anything but common . '' \\n▁ this sounded sickeningly superior . \\n▁ she must have read my face because she went on , ` ` they love it , the mortals who attend . \\n▁ they do n't care . \\n▁ they build their whole lives around it , traveling from feast to feast . \\n▁ they 're like groupies . '' \\n▁ and this sounded simply sickening . \\n▁ ` ` i still do n't get why it 's dangerous , '' i pressed and stephanie leaned back . \\n▁ ` ` because anything goes , '' she replied . \\n▁ ` ` lots of liquor , loud music , dancing and bodies . \\n▁ any mortal is fair game . \\n▁ some have two , three , even more vampires feeding on them at once . \\n▁ there are some feasts , not the ones lucien attends , mind , where there are drugs . \\n▁ sex . \\n▁ orgies . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow , '' i whispered and she smiled . \\n▁ ` ` the good ones are fun . \\n▁ you can take your fill of as many mortals as you want . \\n▁ it 's great . '' \\n▁ it did n't sound great but that was just me . \\n▁ ` ` why would you take a concubine there ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ she shrugged . \\n▁ ` ` to share another part of your life with her . \\n▁ if you ' ve got a good one , to show her off to other vampires . '' \\n▁ something struck me . \\n▁ ` ` if anything goes , and a concubine is mortal , is she fair game ? '' \\n▁ stephanie hesitated a moment before answering , ` ` at the wilder ones , with vamps who do n't take good care of their girls , yes . '' \\n▁ i sucked in breath and she hurried on , ` ` but lucien does n't go to those . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , that 's why it 's dangerous , '' i whispered and edwina made another pip noise . \\n▁ again stephanie and i looked at her . \\n▁ ` ` not entirely , '' stephanie replied , glancing back my way . \\n▁ ` ` what is it , entirely ? '' \\n▁ i pushed . \\n▁ stephanie sighed before saying , ` ` even at the good ones , things can get out of hand . \\n▁ vampires are what we are . \\n▁ it is n't unheard of for there to be bloodlust . \\n▁ in the throes of bloodlust a vampire will go for anything mortal . \\n▁ it 's not unusual for concubines to be used by other vamps , even offered by their own vampire to his friends . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' i breathed . \\n▁ ` ` lucien would n't do that , '' she rushed to assure me . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' i breathed again . \\n▁ she leaned toward me . \\n▁ ` ` leah , seriously , lucien would never share . \\n▁ ever . \\n▁ you have to believe me . \\n▁ i ' m being very serious . '' \\n▁ i just stared at her . \\n▁ she kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` he 'd sense if things were deteriorating and he 'd get you out of there . \\n▁ it would n't matter . \\n▁ no vampire is stupid enough to touch what 's lucien 's . \\n▁ he 'd burn . \\n▁ lucien would make sure of it . \\n▁ he 'd do it himself . \\n▁ he 's even done it before . '' \\n▁ ` ` done what before ? '' \\n▁ ` ` burned another vampire . \\n▁ if memory serves , he 's done it twice . \\n▁ once was after something happened at a feast . \\n▁ the other vamp did n't even feed from his concubine , he just touched her . \\n▁ lucien went mad , hunted him down , made him burn . \\n▁ the second was - '' she did n't finish , i interrupted her by whispering , ` ` made him burn ? '' \\n▁ stephanie nodded . \\n▁ ` ` lucien killed him without a thought and he 'd been within his rights . \\n▁ you do n't touch another vamp 's concubine . \\n▁ most vampires cover it up , make a monetary agreement . \\n▁ they do n't take it that far . \\n▁ any money that exchanges hands they give to their concubine to buy her silence . \\n▁ but lucien would take it that far , no doubt about it . \\n▁ if it happens , it reflects on her vampire . \\n▁ he 'll seek vengeance and it 'll be granted . \\n▁ and she can demand immediate release and that too will be granted . '' \\n▁ ` ` you can demand release ? '' \\n▁ i was too drunk to mask the hope in my voice . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' stephanie answered . \\n▁ ` ` it 's tantamount to neglect which is grounds for unconditional release . '' \\n▁ my inebriated mind recalled reading that in my contract . \\n▁ why had n't i thought of that before ? \\n▁ there were grounds for unconditional release . \\n▁ neglect , which lucien had definitely not done , and extreme cruelty , which he could have done . \\n▁ my brain was drunkenly churning so i did n't catch stephanie getting close . \\n▁ ` ` that does n't count , '' she said softly , reading my drunken thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` it happens to us all , not often but it does . \\n▁ i ' m surprised it happened to lucien but not surprised at the same time , considering it 's you . \\n▁ we lose focus or control . \\n▁ we 're vampires , you 're concubines . \\n▁ it 's the nature of the relationship . '' \\n▁ there it was . \\n▁ my hopes were dashed . \\n▁ again . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't like anything about the relationship . \\n▁ not . \\n▁ one . \\n▁ thing , '' i announced and then took a huge sip of my martini . \\n▁ when i was done swallowing , i caught her sly grin . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll call you tomorrow morning after he feeds tonight and we 'll see what you say about the relationship then . '' \\n▁ i rolled my eyes . \\n▁ stephanie laughed . \\n▁ ` ` do n't you have more boxes to open ? '' \\n▁ i asked tartly . \\n▁ she looked down at the boxes on the coffee table , her eyes narrowed and she reached out to grab one . \\n▁ ` ` this one has a note on it . '' \\n▁ she yanked off the bow using the thick , cream card that was attached . \\n▁ ` ` it says , ` this is for tonight ' . '' \\n▁ she turned it to face me . \\n▁ ` ` that 's lucien 's handwriting . '' \\n▁ i looked at the bold , slashing , powerful , black scrawl that , in itself , was a command even if i could n't make out the words that seemed to be moving under my eyes . \\n▁ of course it was his handwriting . \\n▁ she thrust the box in my hands . \\n▁ ` ` open it . \\n▁ i have to see this . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i thrust it back , ` ` you open it . '' \\n▁ she pushed it back to me . \\n▁ ` ` no , i want to see your face when you see what 's inside . '' \\n▁ i glared at her . \\n▁ she had eternity to live ; she could play this game forever . \\n▁ i had only another forty , fifty years , if i was lucky . \\n▁ i pulled open the box . \\n▁ it was , to my relief , not bondage gear . \\n▁ it was , to my surprise and secret delight , something even more exquisite than the black gown . \\n▁ a rich taupe camisole with dusty , lilac flowers imprinting the silk xxunk , trimmed in delicate taupe lace . \\n▁ the cups were half - xxunk , half - lace . \\n▁ the body was xxunk as were the thin straps . \\n▁ there were matching brazilian cut panties , the front was xxunk with lace trim , the back almost entirely lace except a tantalizing triangle of xxunk at the top . \\n▁ there were sweet little rosettes at the waistband of the panties under the navel and at the juncture of the bodice where it met each of the straps of the camisole . \\n▁ stephanie eyeballed the camisole and panties as she took a sip from her martini . \\n▁ ` ` lucien always had good taste . '' \\n▁ her gaze moved to my face , a smile lit in her eyes and she repeated , ` ` always . '' \\n▁ i decided , yet again , i really liked stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , '' i whispered . \\n▁ she gave me a wink and nodded to the lingerie . \\n▁ ` ` new order . \\n▁ try that on first . \\n▁ then the black gown . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 'll have a fashion parade ! '' \\n▁ edwina shouted enthusiastically from the kitchen where she was cooking dinner . \\n▁ i jumped because i forgot she was there . \\n▁ a fashion parade did n't seem like a bad idea . \\n▁ or at least it did n't after four martinis . \\n▁ i jumped up , wobbled then righted myself and announced , ` ` i 'll change , you open more boxes . '' \\n▁ stephanie did n't need to be told twice . \\n▁ i started to run to the powder room but skidded to a halt and asked edwina like i was a xxunk and stephanie had come over after school , ` ` can stephanie stay for dinner ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course , dear . '' \\n▁ edwina smiled and i smiled back . \\n▁ then i whirled to stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` will you stay for dinner ? '' \\n▁ she was still digging through boxes and did n't look up when she answered , ` ` i 'd like that . '' \\n▁ happy for the first time in weeks , i took my pretty lingerie , deciding not to think of it as a gift from lucien as that would spoil the fun , and ran to the powder room to start the fashion parade . \\n▁ chapter seven the punishment lucien walked into the kitchen from the garage and halted . \\n▁ edwina was busy at the sink scouring pots and pans . \\n▁ the living area looked like an exclusive boutique exploded in it . \\n▁ red tissue paper , ribbons and black boxes were scattered everywhere , mounds of the clothing lucien purchased for leah were smoothed out on the backs and arms of furniture . \\n▁ on the countertop of the island bar were three used martini glasses all with silver toothpicks resting in varying states of martini remains . \\n▁ one still had a half - eaten olive on it . \\n▁ edwina turned to him with a bright smile on her face and he instantly knew she was intoxicated . \\n▁ he saw it and he smelled it . \\n▁ this surprised him . \\n▁ in the forty years she 'd worked for him he had never , not once , come to his concubine 's home to find it a mess , to find the kitchen not sparkling clean , to find edwina inebriated while on duty . \\n▁ he 'd seen her that way , of course , during parties or celebrations where she attended as a guest . \\n▁ for instance the birthday parties he threw every year for his concubines past and present . \\n▁ and the first anniversary of the bloodletting which it was a tradition to celebrate . \\n▁ any other time , never . \\n▁ ` ` you 're here ! '' \\n▁ edwina greeted happily , a huge drunken smile on her face . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes scanned the room again and went back to edwina . \\n▁ ` ` what happened ? '' \\n▁ she glanced over her shoulder at the mess , lifted a hand from the sink and waved it around , slopping soapy water and bubbles on the floor , the counter , her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` we had a fashion parade , '' she explained bizarrely , ignoring the mess she made and went back to scouring . \\n▁ ` ` leah 's up in your bedroom . '' \\n▁ her voice dropped to a happy murmur , ` ` such a sweet , beautiful girl . '' \\n▁ lucien studied his housekeeper . \\n▁ leah was hardly a girl . \\n▁ she was forty years old , for god 's sake . \\n▁ she was , of course , beautiful . \\n▁ but sweet ? \\n▁ ` ` how is she ? '' \\n▁ lucien found himself asking and he had no earthly idea why . \\n▁ he had also , in the years he 'd employed edwina , never requested such information . \\n▁ then again he 'd never needed to . \\n▁ ` ` oh , she 's fine . \\n▁ settling in . \\n▁ she 's so cute . \\n▁ you should have seen her tonight . \\n▁ she was hilarious . '' \\n▁ fascinated by the idea of a cute , hilarious , sweet leah ` ` settling in '' , lucien tired of the discourse with edwina and headed for the stairs . \\n▁ ` ` good night ! '' \\n▁ edwina trilled gaily behind him . \\n▁ lucien did n't reply . \\n▁ five strides into their room , lucien saw leah exiting the bathroom . \\n▁ he again halted . \\n▁ she was wearing the lingerie he 'd sent . \\n▁ he saw he 'd been wrong in his thoughts when he 'd watched the stick thin model sashaying down the short runway displaying it at his personal showing when he was ordering leah 's wardrobe the day after her selection . \\n▁ he had , in his mind , expected it to look far better on leah 's generous curves . \\n▁ however , he had not anticipated it looking that much better . \\n▁ she was wearing her robe over it but the robe had fallen open at her sides exposing the camisole and pants . \\n▁ the cups of the camisole hugged her full br * * sts , the silk ending just above the nipple so a tantalizing hint of the xxunk peeked through the lace , a chill in the air obviously causing her ni * * les to harden against the silk . \\n▁ it hugged her midriff and stomach like it had been made for her . \\n▁ the hem of the camisole left only a glimpse of smooth skin above the underwear . \\n▁ her long legs went on forever beneath the lace of the panties . \\n▁ he felt his body 's immediate response to the sight of her and he liked it . \\n▁ her face had been averted when she walked out of the bathroom but it snapped around , she focused on him and cried , ` ` lucien ! '' \\n▁ lucien only had a moment to brace before she flew at him , running flat out across the room and at the last instant launched herself full body at him . \\n▁ stunned and unsure of her intent , he caught her in his arms , his hands cupping her ass as she wrapped her long limbs around him . \\n▁ instead of attempting , however pointless such an effort would be , to tear him limb - from - limb , she caught his gaze and he noticed she , too , was under the influence . \\n▁ very much so . \\n▁ ` ` hello , darling , how was your day ? '' \\n▁ she purred cheerfully , if drunkenly . \\n▁ ` ` interesting , '' he replied truthfully , this exact moment being indicative of his interesting day . \\n▁ he was on guard , not certain what her game was . \\n▁ his day had been interesting . \\n▁ starting with the roller coaster ride of their morning and ending with leah 's current behavior , it included an afternoon meeting with her aunts . \\n▁ a meeting where they explained their concern that they had n't heard from leah after the bloodletting . \\n▁ a meeting where he declared his intentions and ascertained their tentative allegiance . \\n▁ they were hesitant , considering what it might mean to the future of their family , indeed to the future of all concubines . \\n▁ but they were also not willing to defy him . \\n▁ he was n't entirely surprised at this . \\n▁ they were xxunk and obedience had been ingrained in them for centuries . \\n▁ leah 's hand moved to fiddle with the collar of his shirt , bringing his attention back to her . \\n▁ ` ` mine was too , '' she shared . \\n▁ ` ` is that so ? '' \\n▁ her eyes went from his collar to his and she nodded . \\n▁ fervently . \\n▁ ` ` and what did you do today , my pet ? '' \\n▁ he asked softly , reading her mood and relaxing into it . \\n▁ ` ` first off , i tried to escape . '' \\n▁ his relaxation fled and his body went solid but she did n't notice and kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` i could n't , of course , you took my wallet , my passport , my jewelry , the keys to the car . '' \\n▁ her eyes narrowed on him and she declared , ` ` it was very vexing . '' \\n▁ her words , informative and not accusing , caused his body again to relax . \\n▁ he struggled with the desire to laugh and won before he repeated , ` ` vexing ? '' \\n▁ she nodded , smiling at him and he felt his body go solid again , ` ` yes . \\n▁ vexing . \\n▁ very . '' \\n▁ he was n't listening to her words . \\n▁ he was staring at her mouth . \\n▁ he 'd never seen her smile . \\n▁ this was n't strictly true . \\n▁ he had , from a distance , many times in the last twenty years . \\n▁ he 'd just never had it directed at him . \\n▁ his body reacted to that too , in a way he very much liked . \\n▁ he could remain standing holding her body to his for eternity -lrb- literally -rrb- . \\n▁ but he walked her to the bed and sat on its edge , settling her into his lap , her soft curves pressing against his hardening cock . \\n▁ he liked this too . \\n▁ she was still talking . \\n▁ ` ` then the men arrived with the boxes . \\n▁ lots of boxes . \\n▁ lots and lots and lots . '' \\n▁ she tipped her head to the side and queried , ` ` are you moving in ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he replied and she nodded again , apparently perfectly content with this idea . \\n▁ her hands went to his shoulders and she started to tug off his suit jacket . \\n▁ he reluctantly let her go to assist her with getting it down his arms . \\n▁ all the while she did this , she was still babbling . \\n▁ ` ` then stephanie came over and , lucien , you should have seen her outfit . \\n▁ it was the bomb . '' \\n▁ lucien felt his mouth twitch against the effort of smiling , her eyes dropped to it and she announced , ` ` i like it when your mouth does that . '' \\n▁ he blinked at her slowly and asked , ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ she threw the suit jacket unceremoniously to the end of the bed and then touched the corner of his mouth with her index finger too briefly and her eyes came to his . \\n▁ they were dancing . \\n▁ ` ` when you fight a smile . \\n▁ i like it . \\n▁ it 's sexy , '' she explained . \\n▁ fucking hell , but she was magnificent . \\n▁ he thought she was magnificent when she fought him and when he felt her fear of him and attraction to him . \\n▁ the challenge was exhilarating . \\n▁ but she was even more magnificent now . \\n▁ he would n't have believed this was possible but the evidence was sitting in his lap . \\n▁ he did n't like to feed when the mortal servicing him was inebriated . \\n▁ tipsy , perhaps , downright drunk , no . \\n▁ and leah was beyond inebriated , she was hammered . \\n▁ she 'd brushed her teeth , however , obviously very thoroughly . \\n▁ and her scent was strong enough to overpower the vodka he also caught mingling with her essence . \\n▁ not to mention she was , as edwina described her , hilarious , cute and definitely sweet . \\n▁ therefore , he decided to break his own rule and feed , regardless of the fact that she was smashed . \\n▁ his hands went to her robe , pushing it wide over her shoulders and she did n't hesitate with dropping her arms in an effort to aid him to rid her of it . \\n▁ she also kept chattering . \\n▁ ` ` then stephanie and i had a xxunk then we had some martinis then your other boxes came and we had a fashion parade . \\n▁ then stephanie stayed for dinner , we talked edwina into having martinis with us and , because you sent a lot of boxes , we had even more of a fashion parade . '' \\n▁ she stopped when her arms were loose from the robe and he let it drop to the floor . \\n▁ both of her hands came back to his shirt and she began fiddling with his buttons but her eyes never left his as she continued happily , ` ` i like stephanie . \\n▁ she 's funny . '' \\n▁ his arms circled her waist , one hand drifting down over her ass , one drifting up to capture and play with a lock of her soft , thick hair . \\n▁ ` ` so you had a good time ? '' \\n▁ he asked softly and she nodded again fervently and he went on . \\n▁ ` ` did you like the clothes ? '' \\n▁ this time her eyes grew wide and her nodding became fanatical . \\n▁ ` ` especially this . '' \\n▁ her head tipped down so quickly it nearly collided with his nose and he had to jerk his head back . \\n▁ then she pointed to the camisole . \\n▁ when she was done , her head snapped back up , her hand went directly back to his shirt , this time slapping flat against his pectoral and she kept speaking . \\n▁ ` ` i love this ! \\n▁ it 's perfect for me . \\n▁ and the black dress . \\n▁ the black dress is divine . \\n▁ everyone thinks so ! '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m glad you liked them , pet , '' he murmured on a smile . \\n▁ ` ` oh , i do . \\n▁ with your and my stuff , the dressing room is going to be almost full , '' she declared as if this was a feat akin to climbing mount everest . \\n▁ then her face fell before she informed him , ` ` you forgot shoes . '' \\n▁ his hand twisted , capturing a fistful of hair and he told her , ` ` those are arriving tomorrow . '' \\n▁ her body jerked as she threw both arms straight up in the air and shouted , ` ` yay ! '' \\n▁ with such an enchanting opportunity exposed to him , he released her hair and both of his hands curled around her waist and drifted up the silk at her sides . \\n▁ he did this as he chuckled . \\n▁ he felt a tremor slide through her , her hands settled on his shoulders and she declared , ` ` i like that too . '' \\n▁ his eyes moved from her torso to her face , ` ` you like what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when you chuckle . \\n▁ it 's all rumbly . \\n▁ i especially like it now when i can feel it . '' \\n▁ a wave of desire tore through him so strong if he 'd been standing he 'd have gone down to a knee . \\n▁ his fingers tightened reflexively against her ribs and he had to concentrate so as not to snap them . \\n▁ she began fiddling with the buttons of his shirt again and he realized she was releasing them . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he called , attempting focus and finding , just as at her bloodletting which had been the first time in his very long life , the effort was difficult . \\n▁ she was biting the side of her lip in concentration , her eyes on her task before she asked , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ her head came up and she answered , ` ` taking off your shirt . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ she grinned playfully . \\n▁ ` ` i like your chest . \\n▁ it 's way better than your chuckle . '' \\n▁ after imparting this information on him , she wriggled her bottom in his lap . \\n▁ as much as he was enjoying her , he was done . \\n▁ he had her on her back in an instant , his torso covering hers , her legs still wrapped around his waist so his crotch was seated against the heat of her . \\n▁ his mouth at her throat , he slid his tongue along the length of her jugular , preparing her . \\n▁ he did this carefully , savoring the taste of her but keeping a rigid hold on his control . \\n▁ ` ` it freaks me out when you do that , '' she whispered and his head came up . \\n▁ his hand slid down her side , around , over her ass , pulling her up as he pressed his groin to hers . \\n▁ ` ` do what ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` move so fast . '' \\n▁ his mouth went to hers as he ground their h * ps together . \\n▁ when he did , without hesitation she reciprocated the movement and the effect was staggering . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll get used to it . '' \\n▁ his voice betrayed his heightening arousal . \\n▁ she opened her mouth but did n't get a chance to speak because he kissed her . \\n▁ he dispensed with the discovery he 'd used to initiate their first kiss . \\n▁ his tongue swept inside her mouth and her reaction was delightfully immediate . \\n▁ her body bucked upwards seeking something more even though his weight was pressing her into the bed . \\n▁ her head tipped to the side giving him better access and her tongue tangled boldly with his . \\n▁ her hands tugged his shirt from his trousers and he felt them travel up the skin of his back . \\n▁ her touch sent shockwaves tearing through his system and he growled into her mouth , deepening the kiss . \\n▁ she welcomed it , taking from him at the same time she gave and invited … no , demanded more . \\n▁ he gave her what she wanted and contentedly absorbed her moan when he did . \\n▁ he broke their connection and his mouth glided to her ear . \\n▁ ` ` i like the way you kiss me , pet , '' he whispered there and he felt her head turn . \\n▁ her lips close to his neck , she breathed , no guard over the wonder in her words , ` ` you 're so big , heavy , strong . \\n▁ you make me feel tiny . \\n▁ i ' ve never felt tiny . \\n▁ not in my whole life . '' \\n▁ he sensed this was important , something she 'd always desired but never had and he was pleased he gave that to her . \\n▁ his mouth went back to her throat , gliding again along her skin . \\n▁ he was suddenly intent to give her something else , something she could n't imagine she 'd long for but she would , he 'd see to it . \\n▁ ` ` your mouth is going to tingle , sweetheart , '' he murmured against her skin before he used his tongue on her again . \\n▁ her neck arched , her limbs tightened , her nails curled into the flesh of his back . \\n▁ ` ` it already is , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` why is that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll explain later , '' he replied quietly , his hand at her ass moving around her hip slowly as his mouth drifted up her neck , to her jaw , back to hers . \\n▁ he caught her gaze as he lifted his h * ps away from hers and his fingers trailed along the waistband of her panties . \\n▁ ` ` are you ready for me ? '' \\n▁ he asked softly . \\n▁ her eyes grew wide and her lips parted . \\n▁ lucien loved it when she looked at him like that . \\n▁ especially now . \\n▁ so much , he did n't wait for her reply and his hand dipped into her underwear . \\n▁ he touched her , finding her sleek , hot and very , very wet . \\n▁ she was ready and as if to prove this further , at his exploring touch , her neck arched in invitation . \\n▁ an invitation he gratefully accepted . \\n▁ his lips went to her throat and his teeth tore through , her blood flowing into his mouth at the same time he slid a finger inside her . \\n▁ she gasped and it was n't in pain . \\n▁ it was a sound of sheer pleasure and her h * ps bucked against his hand . \\n▁ he withdrew his hand even though he knew she wanted it and he wanted her to have it . \\n▁ tonight , however , her lesson would be only about the feeding . \\n▁ she whimpered when she lost his hand but he drew her blood into his mouth . \\n▁ he heard her second gasp , this one surprised , excited . \\n▁ her hands coming out of his shirt and , just like that morning but with both of them this time , they came to his neck , up , and then her fingers fisted in his hair . \\n▁ not to pull him back , to hold him to her . \\n▁ her body arched , pressing into his as he heard her heart race , her blood scoring through her system , her breath coming in wilder and wilder pants . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' she breathed , her hands clenching tighter in his hair . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' she cried softly , trembling underneath him . \\n▁ his arm wrapped around her low on her h * ps and he held her body tightly to the warmth of his . \\n▁ he stroked her wound with his tongue and reared up , taking her mouth with his and he kissed her hard . \\n▁ she kissed him back , her hands still clutching his hair , her mouth greedy . \\n▁ he broke the kiss and her eyes slowly opened , xxunk foggy with desire . \\n▁ ` ` do you see why i like the taste of you ? '' \\n▁ he asked , his voice a low growl . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' she whispered her admission , her voice a soft moan . \\n▁ he buried his face in her throat again , reopening the wound and drinking deep . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she whispered . \\n▁ he sucked fiercely , thrilling at the sound of his name on her lips when her blood , just as delicious , surprisingly even more so with the vodka mingled with it , was pouring down his throat . \\n▁ this caused her to gasp yet again and writhe underneath him . \\n▁ she was done , he knew it . \\n▁ he 'd taken enough . \\n▁ even though he wanted more , his mouth detached and he swept his tongue along the wound . \\n▁ the bleeding stopped instantly . \\n▁ the healing had already begun . \\n▁ he pulled his body over her and rolled to his side , gathering her in his arms and taking her with him . \\n▁ he tucked her face in his throat , cautious with the still healing wound . \\n▁ her breathing was heavy as was her pulse and she whispered with a mixture of disappointment and marvel , ` ` you 're done ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head and tightened his arms , drawing her deeper into him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not done , pet . \\n▁ you 're done . '' \\n▁ she was n't done . \\n▁ he knew it the way she moved restlessly against him . \\n▁ it was n't the feeding she wanted , it was the cl * * ax he 'd brought her so very close to and did n't let her have . \\n▁ her head tilted back and he tipped his down to face her . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't be done , '' she whispered and it was a soft demand . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m done , '' he declared . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not , '' she returned , her voice getting stronger as were her movements , her hands sliding over his body , her own body pressing into his . \\n▁ ` ` be still , leah , '' he commanded . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she refused . \\n▁ ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ she pressed closer , her hands moving over his ass , pulling in as she returned , ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ he reached behind him , wrapping his fingers around her wrists and pulling her arms around to the front . \\n▁ he rolled to his back , bringing her with him so she was on top , her arms cocked and caught between them . \\n▁ the deep red of her wound was blazing but the skin was closing . \\n▁ her eyes narrowed and she pressed her soft h * ps into his still hard ones , demanding , ` ` you ca n't seriously think we 're finished . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know it . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're in a state ! '' \\n▁ she observed angrily . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll pass . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m in a state , '' she informed him , her anger escalating at her need to point out her condition . \\n▁ he left her hands trapped between them and he circled her with his arms , giving her a small shake before he held her tightly . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember this morning ? '' \\n▁ he asked softly and her brows knitted over ever - narrowing eyes . \\n▁ ` ` how could i forget ? '' \\n▁ she snapped . \\n▁ ` ` this is your punishment . '' \\n▁ she pulled in a sharp breath as understanding dawned . \\n▁ then she said on a heavy exhale , ` ` you 're joking . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 'll go unfulfilled until you learn your lesson , pet . '' \\n▁ she blinked , hard and fast , her lips parting in shock and anger . \\n▁ all vestiges of cute , hilarious , sweet , intoxicated leah had vanished . \\n▁ lucien uncharacteristically felt doubt about his decision to carry through with her punishment . \\n▁ this was mainly because he liked cute , hilarious , sweet leah and he wanted her back . \\n▁ this was also because she wanted him . \\n▁ she made this abundantly clear without any evasion . \\n▁ even if she had n't , he could smell it . \\n▁ this was also because he wanted her . \\n▁ he wanted to bury himself inside her slick , wet core . \\n▁ he wanted to f * * k her so hard he felt her body jolt under his with his thrusts . \\n▁ he wanted to listen to the noises she made , feel her xxunk clench around him , smell her sex in his nostrils and watch her face as she came . \\n▁ he wanted her more than he 'd ever wanted a female , vampire or mortal . \\n▁ even maggie . \\n▁ and the power of his desire caused him to doubt the wisdom of carrying through with her punishment . \\n▁ she tried to tear free of his arms but he moved swiftly . \\n▁ he exited the bed , taking her with him , standing her on her feet . \\n▁ she swayed a moment then moved to flee but he caught her wrist in an unbreakable grip , ripping his shirt open at the same time , the buttons flying . \\n▁ he released her for less than a second , taking his shirt off . \\n▁ then he tossed her back into bed and as she scrambled to get her limbs in order , he finished disrobing . \\n▁ before she could escape , he had her on her side , her back to his front , tucked into the bend of his body , his arm holding her captive . \\n▁ ` ` let me go , '' she demanded , her breath straining , exposing her body 's inability to keep pace with his . \\n▁ he settled behind her . \\n▁ ` ` leah , sleep . '' \\n▁ she struggled . \\n▁ ` ` let me go . '' \\n▁ he gave her a shake and repeated , ` ` sleep . '' \\n▁ she kept struggling and he contained it effortlessly . \\n▁ this went on for quite some time . \\n▁ suddenly she stilled . \\n▁ he listened to her heavy breathing and felt her legs move , still wrestling with residual desire . \\n▁ after some time , she settled . \\n▁ he thought she 'd conquered her body and finally fell asleep . \\n▁ instead , in a fierce , tortured whisper , she declared , ` ` this morning , if you told me there was a way i could hate you more , i would n't have believed it . \\n▁ but it 's true . '' \\n▁ yes , he seriously doubted the wisdom of carrying through her punishment . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he murmured into her hair . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll never stop hating you , '' she vowed , her voice scratching with her passionate assertion . \\n▁ he pulled her closer and made his own vow . \\n▁ ` ` yes you will , my pet . \\n▁ i 'll find a way through . '' \\n▁ ` ` impossible . '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing is impossible . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 'll see , '' she said , her voice dripping with doubt at his words as well as conviction to her oath . \\n▁ yes , lucien thought but did n't speak aloud , we 'll see . \\n▁ * * * * * lucien woke before leah . \\n▁ his first act was to pull back her head gently to check her wound . \\n▁ fully healed . \\n▁ his next act was to lie beside her watching her sleep . \\n▁ her face was relaxed and expressionless , not one of his preferred looks but appealing all the same . \\n▁ after some time , her eyes fluttered open and , as she had the day before , her expressionless face became bewildered . \\n▁ and , shortly after waking , as she had the day before , she tensed in preparation for flight . \\n▁ he caught her close . \\n▁ her head jerked back , her eyes narrowed and her mouth opened to protest . \\n▁ he brought his down on hers , hard and demanding her response . \\n▁ she withheld and began her vain struggles , as usual stubborn to an extreme . \\n▁ so stubborn , this carried on for long enough that lucien was forced to try a different tactic . \\n▁ rolling her to her back and pinning her , his hands moved on her , down her sides , across her belly , up her midriff , all the while his tongue engaged in its sensual duel with hers . \\n▁ then his hand moved over her breast , cupping it gently before he snagged her nipple with his thumb . \\n▁ her body stopped bucking against his in protest and melted underneath him . \\n▁ ` ` that 's it , sweetheart , '' he whispered against her mouth at her capitulation and he took advantage , his finger met his thumb and he rolled her nipple between them . \\n▁ a delicious noise slid from the back of her throat into his mouth . \\n▁ her legs opened , one calf wrapping around his hip and he caught the scent of her excitement . \\n▁ he smiled his triumph against her mouth and slanted his head for another kiss . \\n▁ she met his intent , her own head tipping to the side , her lips pressing against his , no longer resistant but hungry . \\n▁ he fed her with his hands and his mouth and he kept doing it as she continued to demand it , insatiable , magnificent . \\n▁ after a time , his hand was in her panties , finger pressed deep and swirling , her mouth against his , breaths sharp and sweet against his lips . \\n▁ she was so deep in her need she was unable to concentrate on kissing him or bear the further sensation of his tongue in her mouth . \\n▁ her hand was clenched in his hair , her other arm wrapped tight around his back . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ! '' \\n▁ she gasped urgently and he saw it on her face , he smelled it , he knew she was right there . \\n▁ he withdrew his hand . \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ she cried , her hand going to his , fingers wrapping around his wrist . \\n▁ her cry sliced through him like a blade . \\n▁ he had been incorrect in what he 'd told her the morning before . \\n▁ even as tortured as her cry was , he suspected this was far more difficult on him than it was on her . \\n▁ however , he 'd chosen his path and he had to continue his efforts at her taming . \\n▁ she had no way of knowing but he knew the reward at the end would be worth the battle . \\n▁ ` ` will you mind me ? '' \\n▁ he queried , his voice was harsh , not with anger but with regret . \\n▁ her hazy eyes struggled to focus on his face . \\n▁ ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ ` ` will you mind me ? '' \\n▁ he watched the haze clear , his words penetrating , incredulity flooding her face , quickly chased by anger . \\n▁ ` ` i f * * king hate you , '' she hissed but even as she did , her h * ps sought his , her body agitated , struggling with her desire . \\n▁ lucien sighed impatiently . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll take that as a no . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're damn right it 's a no ! '' \\n▁ she snapped and her body wrenched unsuccessfully against his hold . \\n▁ after this failure , she let out an enraged , strangled scream . \\n▁ ` ` leah , you can end this now , '' he told her . \\n▁ ` ` go to hell ! '' \\n▁ she flashed . \\n▁ ` ` do you want my mouth on you ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` go to hell ! '' \\n▁ she repeated . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me inside you ? '' \\n▁ she froze and shrieked , ` ` go to hell ! '' \\n▁ he threw a thigh over her legs and captured her moving body against his . \\n▁ with a hand in her hair , he tucked her face in his neck . \\n▁ ` ` you 're very stubborn , pet , '' he murmured into the hair at the top of her head . \\n▁ her body gave a mighty flex then went limp . \\n▁ she grew silent . \\n▁ he held her closer . \\n▁ after long moments , he said softly , ` ` i 'll be leaving soon . '' \\n▁ she made no reply . \\n▁ ` ` while i ' m gone , if you touch yourself , leah , i 'll know and i 'll have to deal with that too . '' \\n▁ he could hear the pace of her heart increase but her body tensed only briefly before she subdued her reaction . \\n▁ ` ` do you understand me ? '' \\n▁ he pushed . \\n▁ she remained silent . \\n▁ ` ` leah , i asked , do you understand me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' she gritted between her teeth . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be home at ten . \\n▁ we 're going out tonight . \\n▁ i want you ready . '' \\n▁ she did n't speak . \\n▁ ` ` leah , when i talk to you , you acknowledge what i say . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be ready , '' she bit out . \\n▁ ` ` i want you wearing the black dress . '' \\n▁ she made an angry noise but whispered , ` ` i 'll be wearing the black dress . '' \\n▁ his hand moved from her head to her jaw and with his thumb under her chin , he tilted her face up to receive his soft kiss . \\n▁ then he left her in bed and went to shower . \\n▁ after he turned off the water and stepped out of the shower , while he was reaching for a towel , in the sudden silence , he heard it . \\n▁ his head shot up and cocked to the side . \\n▁ quietly , likely muffled in her pillow , he heard her sobs . \\n▁ good christ . \\n▁ he 'd broken her . \\n▁ he 'd f * * king broken her . \\n▁ he 'd taken a huge step closer to her taming . \\n▁ he 'd expected to feel elation at this moment . \\n▁ instead , his eyes met his reflection in the mirror and he growled a low , slow , agonized , ` ` fuck . '' \\n▁ * * * * * that night when he arrived home promptly at ten , he opened the door from the garage to the kitchen and found her there , waiting for him in the kitchen . \\n▁ her hair was swept back from her face to tumble in a mass of curls down her exposed back . \\n▁ she wore no jewels because she did n't have any . \\n▁ she did n't need them . \\n▁ the dress was spectacular , elegant and enticing . \\n▁ the spike - heeled , xxunk satin , strappy sandals were delicate , sexy and significantly lengthened her already tall frame , making her striking and , he suspected , to any other man but lucien , even intimidating . \\n▁ her makeup was smoky and dramatic , heightening the mystery behind her stunning but expressionless face . \\n▁ her eyes caught his and there was no flash , no dancing , they were completely blank . \\n▁ ` ` hello , darling , how was your day ? '' \\n▁ she asked as if she was a robot and this was a xxunk message set to play at appropriately programmed times . \\n▁ suddenly angry , he stopped five feet from her and commanded , ` ` come here , leah . '' \\n▁ without hesitation she moved to him . \\n▁ his body tensed at her uncharacteristic acquiescence . \\n▁ ` ` put your arms around me , '' he went on . \\n▁ she did as he demanded but her eyes remained at his throat . \\n▁ ` ` look at me , pet . '' \\n▁ she immediately tipped her head back and caught his eyes . \\n▁ trying to read her mood , lucien sought patience , wrapped an arm around her and cupped her jaw with his other hand . \\n▁ ` ` you 're angry with me , '' he murmured and she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` no , darling , why would you think that ? '' \\n▁ his patience slipped . \\n▁ ` ` leah , stop it , '' he ordered . \\n▁ her head tilted to the side in an unnatural movement . \\n▁ ` ` stop what ? '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed as her intent came clear . \\n▁ ` ` so , this is your game now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` my game ? '' \\n▁ she asked with what sounded like genuine confusion . \\n▁ he watched her carefully empty face . \\n▁ then he decided , so be it . \\n▁ he could work with this . \\n▁ in fact , he had a feeling he 'd enjoy it . \\n▁ ` ` i need to change , '' he informed her and she made to move away but his arm tightened and he said , ` ` no . '' \\n▁ she stopped and regarded him . \\n▁ ` ` kiss me before i go upstairs . '' \\n▁ without delay she got up on her toes , pressed against him and touched her parted lips to his . \\n▁ then she pulled away and asked , as if she sincerely cared about his answer , ` ` was that okay ? '' \\n▁ he thought she 'd have trouble with that . \\n▁ she had no trouble with that . \\n▁ she was good . \\n▁ therefore his tests would need to be more challenging . \\n▁ ` ` it will do , '' he let her go , ` ` for now . '' \\n▁ he walked away but she called to his back , ` ` what do you want me to do while you 're changing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` whatever you want , '' he replied and imagined her first thought was to search the house for gasoline and matches . \\n▁ upstairs he changed his shirt and was walking back through the bathroom to join leah when his eyes caught on something . \\n▁ he halted . \\n▁ looking in the trash bin , he saw taupe wisps of shredded silk and lace , the lilac - flowered imprints barely nuances in the tatters . \\n▁ he reached down and allowed the obliterated material of the lingerie leah wore the night before to sift through his fingers . \\n▁ he straightened , his mouth tightening at the same time he felt a similar sensation in his gut . \\n▁ then something profound cut through him . \\n▁ he did n't understand it and he did n't f * * king like it . \\n▁ it was a feeling he 'd never felt in his very long life and a feeling he never wanted to have again . \\n▁ last night , wearing that lingerie , she had run to him . \\n▁ flung herself in his arms told him she liked it when he bit back a smile . \\n▁ rejoiced in the gifts he 'd given her particularly the camisole and panties . \\n▁ smiled at him for the first time . \\n▁ and passionately enjoyed her bloodletting . \\n▁ now , that lingerie , what would have been a physical reminder to both of them throughout their arrangement of the splendor of last night , lay shredded and discarded in a trash bin . \\n▁ and he , and his unwise decision to carry out her punishment even after she 'd given glaring indication of what edwina called ` ` settling in '' , was solely responsible for the bleak emotion evidenced in that f * * king bin . \\n▁ ` ` fuck , '' he swore , his stare riveted to the scraps , his mind consumed with what they meant . \\n▁ then he cleared his thoughts and walked downstairs to leah . \\n▁ chapter eight the feast i sat in the porsche as lucien drove us to wherever the hell we were going . \\n▁ ever his new , obedient concubine , i had n't asked and he had n't shared . \\n▁ it was taking a lot out of me not to turn and claw out his eyes or throw open my door and toss myself bodily from the car . \\n▁ the reason for this was not only because my why i hate lucien vault was so full . \\n▁ that morning , he came fully dressed from the bathroom . \\n▁ this was luckily after i had plenty of time to dry the tears from my face and pretend to be sleeping . \\n▁ still , even though he at least should have pretended to believe i was sleeping after he was such a big , fat , vampire jerk , he 'd kissed the nape of my exposed neck softly before he left -lrb- the bastard -rrb- . \\n▁ i then spent the whole day mentally moving everything to a far , far , far bigger vault . \\n▁ it was also because , ten minutes into our drive , lucien 's hand had come to my leg . \\n▁ he 'd slowly slid the gorgeous material aside exposing my thigh then , when he was n't shifting , he stroked the skin on the inside gently , leisurely , enticingly and , worst of all , constantly . \\n▁ it was driving me mad . \\n▁ it was driving me mad because it felt so f * * king good . \\n▁ what was worse was that wherever the hell we were going was a long , long way from the house lucien provided for me . \\n▁ which meant my torture seemed to last an eternity . \\n▁ during that eternity , i decided i 'd never forgive him . \\n▁ i 'd never , ever forgive him for forcing my body to betray me again and again thus making me hate myself more than i hated him . \\n▁ we were deep in the bowels of the city -lrb- and ` ` bowels '' was an aptly descriptive word -rrb- , when he turned into an alley . \\n▁ i did n't normally hang in alleys but if i were to choose one this one would be near the bottom of the list . \\n▁ lucien slowed to a stop and all of a sudden from out of nowhere a man jumped toward the car . \\n▁ i could n't control my surprised gasp . \\n▁ lucien 's hand flexed on the inside of my thigh and he murmured , ` ` it 's all right , pet . '' \\n▁ i forced myself to turn and nod at him as if i trusted him with my very life even though i did not . \\n▁ his latest maneuver of driving me down a dank alley was proof positive why i should n't . \\n▁ my door was flung open and a hand was shoved through . \\n▁ i shrank from it as i heard a stranger say , ` ` milady . '' \\n▁ ` ` take his hand , leah , '' lucien ordered and i did n't want to , i really did n't want to , but i did . \\n▁ the stranger helped me out of the car . \\n▁ he was shorter than me , wiry to the point of being gaunt and i guessed he was younger than me by at least a decade . \\n▁ he was paying me no attention even as he cautiously steered me clear of the door before he slammed it to . \\n▁ his eyes were hungry on lucien who had alighted out the other side . \\n▁ very hungry . \\n▁ creepy hungry . \\n▁ how incredibly weird . \\n▁ ` ` wats , '' lucien said before he casually tossed the keys to his absurdly expensive sports car to a man who resembled a tramp who had just had a clean at the shelter where he 'd been given ill - fitting clothes and a not so good haircut . \\n▁ ` ` master , '' the man panted upon catching the keys , his eyes glued to lucien and i felt a sick feeling crawl through the pit of my stomach . \\n▁ faster than a flash lucien was at my side , his fingers firm at my elbow , drawing me away from the stranger . \\n▁ the man 's eyes flickered to me before moving devotedly back to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` like they 're all saying , she 's beautiful , master , '' he breathed , leaning into lucien but holding himself back , quite obviously wary , excited , petrified all at the same time . \\n▁ i looked up to lucien to see he was regarding the man with barely concealed revulsion . \\n▁ ` ` take care of the car , wats , '' lucien ordered . \\n▁ wats nodded , still panting while he backed away , slightly bowing like a mad scientist 's deformed lackey in a bad horror movie . \\n▁ lucien moved me toward a door and i followed . \\n▁ i wanted to ask about wats but i did n't . \\n▁ i wanted to run screaming into the night but i did n't . \\n▁ crazily , i also wanted to throw myself in lucien 's arms and beg him to f * * k me against the wall in the alley . \\n▁ i most certainly did n't do that . \\n▁ the door opened before we arrived , a similar character to wats but rounder , older , with a thick beard and a mess of long , tangled hair was holding the door wide . \\n▁ ` ` master , '' he whispered reverently , his eyes dropping as if he was too lowly a creature to gaze upon the magnificence of lucien and my stomach twisted nauseatingly . \\n▁ ` ` breed , '' lucien murmured his greeting not even glancing the man 's way , leading me by him and into a dark hall that almost immediately led to stairs going down . \\n▁ the door closed behind us and i barely controlled my desire to jump or cry out . \\n▁ we started descending the stairs side - by - side and lucien still had n't taken his hand from my arm . \\n▁ ` ` we get to the feast , pet , you are n't outside touching distance from me unless i specifically allow it . \\n▁ am i understood ? '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ he was taking me to a feast . \\n▁ i was n't ready for a feast , i was pretty sure . \\n▁ ` ` you 're understood , '' i mumbled regardless of my newfound terror , making an attempt to instill in my tone the reverence breed used , thinking this would annoy him greatly . \\n▁ apparently , it worked . \\n▁ his head turned sharply to the side and his fingers dug into the flesh around my elbow painfully . \\n▁ when i looked up to him , forcing my face into what i hoped was innocence mixed with eagerness -lrb- wats and breed had given me a great idea -rrb- , i saw his eyes narrow and his mouth grow tight . \\n▁ he , and thus i , remained silent as we descended the first staircase . \\n▁ and the second . \\n▁ and the third . \\n▁ at the end of the fourth , lucien guided me into my first feast . \\n▁ i saw immediately there was a reason wats and breed were n't down here . \\n▁ the place was a crush of beautiful people . \\n▁ not thin . \\n▁ not gaunt . \\n▁ not heavy . \\n▁ not ill - kept . \\n▁ perfect . \\n▁ i did n't know where the vampires ended and the mortals began . \\n▁ and all of them were dressed impeccably . \\n▁ the men in tuxedos or well - cut suits , the women in evening gowns . \\n▁ there was no one there that looked hopeful and desperate to be chosen . \\n▁ no overabundance of jewels and finery . \\n▁ the people here were too cool , too elegant , too polished to exhibit themselves in a way that would cry for attention . \\n▁ the people were the only thing about the place that was elegant . \\n▁ it looked like it was made out of cement , all of it , including the bar that ran along the length of one side . \\n▁ the shelves at the back were glass however , covered in bottles of liquor and different shaped glasses , backlit with red lights as was the rest of the place , all of it illuminated by very dim , red lights . \\n▁ the music was loud . \\n▁ not rock ' n ' roll but slow , throbbing and seductive . \\n▁ as unassuming as it was , the room seemed alive as a hum of conversation ran low under the music . \\n▁ people were standing and talking or moving gracefully between the tightly packed bodies . \\n▁ there was what amounted to a dance floor but the dancers were n't exactly dancing . \\n▁ i found my attention riveted to them as i watched the bodies move , pressed tight , swaying against each other suggestively , hands moving , reaching , touching . \\n▁ faces tucked into necks , lips and , even from my distance i saw a few glistening tongues gliding along jaws , cheekbones , temples , shoulders , other lips . \\n▁ it did n't seem there were couples but like the group was one , a whole , anyone who joined it would be pulled into what amounted to mass foreplay . \\n▁ no wonder edwina , who thought of her girls as good girls , did n't want them to come here . \\n▁ i could n't believe lucien brought me here . \\n▁ not that i had any problem with this kind of thing , it just was n't my scene . \\n▁ it was on the tip of my tongue to ask him if this was also part of my punishment when he dropped my arm , caught my hand in his and he drove forward , propelling us through the bodies . \\n▁ his grip was sure and strong as he pulled me through . \\n▁ i saw people turn to him and nod acknowledgement . \\n▁ a few mouthed greetings . \\n▁ i also saw people studying me , faces impassive , eyes scanning , too sophisticated to be overt but still betraying their curiosity . \\n▁ lucien stopped at the bar and , with a tug on my hand , yanked me through the final throng . \\n▁ in a tiny patch of free space , he curled his arm , whirling me so my back was plastered to his front , his arm tight around my waist , his hand still in mine and he did n't let me go . \\n▁ ` ` what are you drinking tonight , pet ? '' \\n▁ he asked , his mouth bent to my ear and it pissed me off his deep voice sounding against my skin made me shiver . \\n▁ i twisted my head and his came up to give it room to move . \\n▁ i got up on tiptoes and sought his ear where i answered , ` ` what do you want me to drink ? '' \\n▁ reflexively his arm tightened at my waist as his head shot up and his eyes scanned my face in the red light . \\n▁ then he looked away , clearly angry and jerked his chin at the bartender . \\n▁ it was then i decided maybe i was laying it on a bit thick . \\n▁ he looked back down at me , dipping his face close , his forehead touching mine , his mouth a breath away . \\n▁ ` ` i like you best when you 're drunk on vodka , '' he declared . \\n▁ his words invoking a memory that made my stomach pitch in a way that was n't sickening but it hurt all the same . \\n▁ i did n't know what came over me the night before . \\n▁ that was n't entirely true . \\n▁ i did . \\n▁ i was drunk and my inhibitions were swept away . \\n▁ they said you act most honestly when you 're drunk which gave me something else to spend my day fretting and getting angry at myself about . \\n▁ and last night , for the first time , i enjoyed my time with him before the bloodletting not to mention the bloodletting itself , which was , i could n't deny it , unbelievable . \\n▁ by the time i 'd drunk my last martini , i 'd listened to both edwina and stephanie talking about what a great man he was , how generous he was with his concubines when they were with him and after he released them . \\n▁ apparently , he not only took care of them , he still saw most of them , even the ones who were now old and frail . \\n▁ it did n't hurt that the evidence of his colossal generosity was scattered around me , the clothes , the house , the housekeeper . \\n▁ sometime during the fashion parade , i 'd forgotten my why i hate lucien vault and instead only remembered the good parts about him . \\n▁ the way a smile tugged at his mouth . \\n▁ the way his eyes went hooded when he knew i was watching him and i liked what i saw . \\n▁ the way he thought my worst traits were amusing . \\n▁ the way he could sometimes be gentle and patient . \\n▁ the way he kissed . \\n▁ good parts he showed upon arriving home , cementing in my inebriated mind that i 'd been wrong about him . \\n▁ until he proved me right , that was . \\n▁ his face pulled away , wrenching me from my thoughts . \\n▁ i watched him glance again to the bar and order , ` ` two martinis , vodka , olives . '' \\n▁ after this , lucien was silent and motionless until our drinks arrived . \\n▁ once they did he passed a bill to the bartender . \\n▁ i took my drink and he repositioned us . \\n▁ lucien with mostly his side but also his back to the bar . \\n▁ me turned to the room , my back still tight to his front , my body snugly , possessively , even protectively held in the curve of his arm . \\n▁ his mouth came back to my ear and , apropos of nothing , he murmured , ` ` breed and wats are hangers . '' \\n▁ i had n't asked but i was curious to know . \\n▁ i turned my head to face him and when i did i saw his expression was guarded and watchful . \\n▁ yes , i 'd taken it too far . \\n▁ damn . \\n▁ while doing my hair for the night -lrb- edwina wanted to do it but i put my foot down this time -rrb- , i 'd come up with my plan . \\n▁ he wanted to instruct me ? \\n▁ well , i was going to teach him a few lessons too . \\n▁ but i 'd gotten carried away . \\n▁ i determined to rectify that . \\n▁ ` ` hangers ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` what does that mean ? '' \\n▁ i went on . \\n▁ he looked to the room . \\n▁ it was a gesture i was meant to follow which i did and when i was facing the room his mouth came back to my ear . \\n▁ ` ` they want to be down here . '' \\n▁ i stayed facing forward , something i sensed he wanted me to do and asked , ` ` have they ever been down here ? '' \\n▁ ` ` never , and they never will , '' he answered . \\n▁ ` ` but they do n't give up . \\n▁ obsessed with vampires and our culture , especially the feasts . \\n▁ obsessed in an unhealthy way . \\n▁ they ' ve made themselves servants , unpaid unless someone gives them a gratuity . '' \\n▁ i felt badly for breed and wats , to want something so badly , to be so close but never to have what you want . \\n▁ ` ` how do they know about vampires ? '' \\n▁ i queried since i thought no one but those in the life did . \\n▁ ` ` they sense us , '' lucien answered . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no idea how . \\n▁ very few mortals do . \\n▁ and those who do always become hangers . '' \\n▁ i found this interesting . \\n▁ ` ` do people tip them ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` rarely . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they 're filthy , ill - bred , unkempt . \\n▁ most vampires have the capacity to procure the finer things in life and they do , without fail . \\n▁ they do n't have patience for reminders that there might be something less . '' \\n▁ i felt my body stiffen as he continued , ` ` and they 're hangers , leah . \\n▁ zealots . \\n▁ they make people uncomfortable , vampires but especially the mortals . \\n▁ they 're not only uninvited , they are n't wanted . '' \\n▁ i looked across the room , taking in the beautiful people who could afford the finer things in life who would n't tolerate the not so beautiful people who had next to nothing . \\n▁ then i remembered lucien tossing his keys to wats and wats 's fanatical xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` do you tip them ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , thinking he might not hear me , my voice was so low and forgetting he was a vampire , so of course he 'd hear me . \\n▁ ` ` always , '' lucien answered and i twisted my neck to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i breathed , not knowing why his answer , which was the right answer , meant so much to me . \\n▁ his eyes roamed my face and i watched the guard go down as they gentled . \\n▁ ` ` really , my pet . \\n▁ they would n't eat if it was n't for cosmo and me . '' \\n▁ without my permission , my body relaxed into his and i faced forward again . \\n▁ his arm grew tighter around my waist as his mouth went back to my ear . \\n▁ ` ` it does n't make us terribly popular with our kind , however . '' \\n▁ ` ` screw 'em , '' i muttered before i could stop myself and i felt his body shake with laughter as i heard his throat roar with it . \\n▁ automatically , my entire being tuned itself to his laughter . \\n▁ something i had n't heard since yesterday morning . \\n▁ something that seemed to feed me , not like chocolate or some other forbidden treat , but like essential nourishment . \\n▁ i felt my throat close with fear at the very thought . \\n▁ in all the time i was with him , a vampire who drank human blood , who was vastly stronger than me -lrb- hell , than anyone i knew -rrb- , who hurt me and humbled me and played my body against me , i 'd never felt more fear than at that moment . \\n▁ he felt it or sensed it , i knew this when his mouth at my ear called questioningly , ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ i noticed it then . \\n▁ something else . \\n▁ something that had been playing at the edge of my consciousness since we arrived . \\n▁ actually , two things . \\n▁ the first was n't so much real as it was an undercurrent . \\n▁ the eyes . \\n▁ the ears . \\n▁ the senses . \\n▁ the attention . \\n▁ surreptitiously people were watching us , listening to us , probably , as some of them were vampires , hearing our words , smelling my perfume mingled with his woodsy cologne . \\n▁ i was n't the sole curiosity , being new to this crowd . \\n▁ it was also lucien . \\n▁ in fact , it seemed to be mostly lucien . \\n▁ it was like we were movie stars … no . \\n▁ it was like he was a wildly famous movie star , i was his arm candy and we 'd gone out to a regular club amongst the common people . \\n▁ the second thing was what i 'd felt at the selection . \\n▁ the weird drugged feeling . \\n▁ the feeling stephanie explained was him tracking me , marking me . \\n▁ ` ` are you marking me ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ his arm at my waist slid up , his hand stopping at the side of my breast , his thumb stroking the skin over my dress there . \\n▁ i felt his head move , his mouth no longer at my ear but his lips were against my neck . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he answered . \\n▁ i forgot our audience , who were now getting a show , turned slightly to him and his head came up . \\n▁ i got close to his face and asked , ` ` what is that ? '' \\n▁ he answered without delay . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve tuned myself to you . '' \\n▁ i did n't know what that meant . \\n▁ ` ` what does that mean ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` you know i can hear your heart ? '' \\n▁ he asked in return . \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ he hesitated before he went on , ` ` you know i can control your mind ? '' \\n▁ i swallowed before i nodded again and asked , ` ` are you reading my mind ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't read your mind unless you 're speaking to me with it . '' \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ that was a relief . \\n▁ ` ` so what are you doing ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve adjusted you to me and me to you . \\n▁ at the same time i ' ve attuned my senses to you , so every breath you take , every slight movement , i know it almost before you do it . '' \\n▁ i did n't get it but whatever it was , it was freaking me out ! \\n▁ ` ` what does that mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it means our hearts are beating in tandem . \\n▁ it means i ' m anticipating your movements . \\n▁ it says to the vampires in this room who can hear it and feel it , that you 're mine . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't they already know that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` then is n't that overkill ? '' \\n▁ for some reason his face got hard before he replied , ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't you think you holding me pretty much sends the message ? '' \\n▁ ` ` holding you is a message i ' m sending to the mortals . '' \\n▁ i was surprised at that answer . \\n▁ ` ` what do they care ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't give a f * * k if they care . \\n▁ i care . \\n▁ but it says i ' m not here to feed . \\n▁ i ' m not here to play . \\n▁ i ' m not here to f * * k. i ' m here to be with you . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ what did that mean ? \\n▁ i did n't ask because i did n't want to know . \\n▁ and why did my heart skip a beat when he said that ? \\n▁ i did n't even answer myself . \\n▁ instead i asked something far , far more stupid and definitely more dangerous . \\n▁ ` ` do you do this with all your concubines ? '' \\n▁ then i got the answer to my very stupid , very , very dangerous question . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve never done it with another concubine . '' \\n▁ i felt my mouth drop open . \\n▁ i knew i was gaping at him and i knew i had an audience . \\n▁ i was just too shocked to care . \\n▁ finally , i squeaked , ` ` why me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're leah . '' \\n▁ he felt this was an answer . \\n▁ i did n't feel the same but i decided not to push it because i sensed innately that i would n't want to know the answer to that either . \\n▁ even though i really wanted to know the answer . \\n▁ my eyes skittered around the room and came back to him . \\n▁ ` ` is anyone else doing it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` there are no other vampires here with their concubines ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , there are . '' \\n▁ ` ` but they are n't doing it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` why not ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because they ca n't . '' \\n▁ i felt the martini glass slipping through my fingers but i did n't notice he caught it by its stem before it even cleared my hand . \\n▁ it also did n't register that he placed it and his on the bar and he turned me full - frontal into his arms . \\n▁ i tipped my head back to look at him , put my hands to his chest and stared . \\n▁ then i asked , ` ` why ca n't anyone else do it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` very few vampires have the capacity to mesmerize . \\n▁ those that do do n't have the control i have . \\n▁ none of them , or none that i know , have anywhere near the potency of my ability . '' \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ ` ` this is crazy , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` you 're correct , in a way . \\n▁ what i can do is very unusual . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll say ! '' \\n▁ i cried . \\n▁ he grinned at my outburst . \\n▁ i ignored his grin . \\n▁ ` ` is that why everyone is staring at you like you 're a movie star ? '' \\n▁ i blurted , his head cocked and he examined me inquisitively for a long moment . \\n▁ finally he asked , ` ` you noticed that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's hard to miss . '' \\n▁ he leaned back against the bar and pulled me with him so i was on my toes , my body flattened against his . \\n▁ his hand came up and twisted in my hair like he did when we were alone , not like we were the focus of hundreds of eyes and mammoth amounts of vampire extra sensory perception . \\n▁ then he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` it 's part of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 's the other part ? '' \\n▁ his hand twisted deeper into my hair and his mouth came to mine . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll leave that for later , shall we ? '' \\n▁ i wanted to say no , we shall not . \\n▁ but far more agreeable , xxunk , hopefully annoying leah would n't have demanded an explanation . \\n▁ and anyway , i did n't get a chance . \\n▁ he kissed me . \\n▁ he did this too in the same way he 'd do it when we were alone . \\n▁ in other words , it was a deep , open - mouthed , tongues tangling , make me breathe heavily , fiery shot right between the legs kiss . \\n▁ further , there was something different about it , better , more intense , almost overpowering but in a really good way . \\n▁ i knew intuitively it was because he 'd marked me . \\n▁ i knew it was because our bodies were attuned . \\n▁ i did n't know how and i did n't understand what that meant , i just knew it affected me physically in a way that shook me to my soul . \\n▁ when he lifted his head , i found i was hanging on , beyond my toes , straight to my tiptoes . \\n▁ my front was pressed deep to his , the fingers of one hand curled on his shoulder , the other wrapped insistently around the back of his neck . \\n▁ ` ` i f * * king love the way you kiss , '' he growled again like we were n't in a jam - packed , vibrating , vampire club . \\n▁ the almost feral rumble of his growl slid through me , making my toes curl . \\n▁ that 's when i felt it , the buzz , the undercurrent that was focused on us had shifted , intensified , become rapt . \\n▁ i felt eyes on us now and i knew they were n't furtive . \\n▁ the heat hit my face just as the danger permeated my consciousness . \\n▁ ` ` something 's wrong , '' i breathed . \\n▁ his face took on that inquisitive look again as he studied me then he replied , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ his eyes lifted , moving across the room . \\n▁ i registered impatience , frustration then stony resignation in his expression before he answered , ` ` it 's time for me to be good , pet . '' \\n▁ this made no sense whatsoever but before i could ask another question , he 'd moved us again to our original positions , his hand with my glass coming in front of me . \\n▁ i took it , lifted it to my lips and sucked back a healthy sip mostly because i needed it . \\n▁ i should have taken a larger sip because his mouth came back to my ear and he asked , ` ` do you want to dance ? '' \\n▁ my eyes shot to the writhing dance floor and my legs wobbled . \\n▁ there it was . \\n▁ to be obedient leah , i was going to have to do something i really did n't want to do . \\n▁ ` ` if you want to . '' \\n▁ i tried to sound respectful and subservient like his wish was my command but i was n't sure i accomplished this feat . \\n▁ my fears were proved correct when i felt his body move with his chuckle at my back . \\n▁ ` ` we do n't have to do anything you do n't want to do , leah . '' \\n▁ we did n't ? \\n▁ boy , that was a first . \\n▁ i stared at the undulating bodies on the dance floor , trying and failing to imagine lucien 's powerful frame among them and gulped before asking , ` ` um , do , you , er , dance ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not publicly , no . \\n▁ however , privately , yes . '' \\n▁ i twisted my neck to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` privately ? '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` drink up , pet , and i 'll show you the feast . '' \\n▁ i felt my brows knit . \\n▁ ` ` i thought we were at the feast . '' \\n▁ his fingers wrapped around my wrist and lifted my glass to my lips . \\n▁ ` ` drink , '' he ordered . \\n▁ i drank and he took my glass , put it next to his on the bar and then captured my hand . \\n▁ again , he moved us through the crowd , his hand secure in mine , anchoring me to him as he pushed through . \\n▁ the bodies seemed to close in this time , the eyes no longer averted , the curiosity now explicit . \\n▁ lucien either ignored it or did n't notice it -lrb- likely the first -rrb- . \\n▁ he led me to a back wall where there was an open doorway that led to a shadowed hall . \\n▁ what looked like an xxunk bouncer was standing just outside the doorway . \\n▁ without hesitation or even glancing at the bouncer , lucien guided me in . \\n▁ the hall was long and snaking , turning this way and that , not with corners but with curves . \\n▁ there were no doors which i thought was way weird . \\n▁ it was shadowed , creepy and strangely threatening and if i was n't with lucien there was no way i 'd have been there . \\n▁ the music and the hum slowly died as we moved forward and followed the snake . \\n▁ finally , with the club just a soft , nearly indistinct buzz behind us , we turned an actual corner . \\n▁ and i was confronted with a feast . \\n▁ my first instinct was to look away . \\n▁ but it was like a car crash and i could n't , no matter how much i wanted to . \\n▁ it was different here , like night and day . \\n▁ the walls were n't cement but painted a deep , rich red . \\n▁ the floor was covered in thick pile carpets and pillows . \\n▁ some of pillows huge , the size of double beds . \\n▁ some of them smaller . \\n▁ all of them covered in velvet in different rich shades , plum , scarlet , sapphire , ruby , forest green , wine and blood red . \\n▁ there were enormous mirrors on the wall framed in heavily carved , dark wood reflecting the activity on the pillows , against the walls , on the floor . \\n▁ feeding and lots of it . \\n▁ on a double - bed - sized pillow was a woman so stunning she looked like a model , her alabaster skin exposed in a low - cut black dress . \\n▁ three vampires were attached to her . \\n▁ one at her neck , one at her ankle and one whose mouth was at her cle * * age suckling at the side of her breast . \\n▁ my gaze floated , horrified at the raw , brutal sensuality of it . \\n▁ it was everywhere . \\n▁ i could n't escape it . \\n▁ i tore my eyes free , trying to find a safe place but caught an image in a mirror , a vampire nearly as big as lucien had a tiny woman pinned to the wall . \\n▁ her head was lolling on her shoulder , her arms limp . \\n▁ he was holding her to his mouth with his hands under her armpits , her feet clean off the floor , legs dangling . \\n▁ her face was a picture of ecstasy as blood dribbled down her neck , escaping his mouth . \\n▁ with nowhere to put my eyes , i turned into lucien and shoved my face in his massive chest . \\n▁ my hands lifting , fingers curling into his lapels , i pulled the fabric to my cheeks so no vision could penetrate even accidentally . \\n▁ his arms came around me , a hand drifting up my na * * d spine , under my hair to rest warm on my neck . \\n▁ i felt his body bow so his mouth could be at the top of my head and my face and torso arched into his to keep the contact . \\n▁ his voice was low when he asked quietly , ` ` you do n't think it 's beautiful ? '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ he thought this was beautiful ? \\n▁ a thought occurred to me and , panicked , my head snapped back and his jerked up to avoid a collision . \\n▁ ` ` do n't feed from me here , '' i blurted out my plea . \\n▁ i felt his body jolt then saw his eyes narrow before he asked , ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` please . \\n▁ i 'll do anything you say . \\n▁ just do n't feed from me here . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' i shook his lapels roughly and pressed closer , going up on my toes , so much in a state i did n't measure my words . \\n▁ ` ` promise me , lucien . \\n▁ what happened last night is something special , something that should be between us , not reflected in a f * * king mirror for anyone to see . '' \\n▁ at my words , his face gentled , his fingers came to my hairline at the side of my head and slid in , stopping , curling and holding me there before he whispered , ` ` sweetheart - '' i was too rocked by what i just witnessed , knowing how it felt , seeing what was likely my ecstasy of last night on that woman 's face , i did n't let his actions register . \\n▁ or his tone . \\n▁ or the endearment he 'd used last night and this morning which i thought , regardless of the outcome of both events , was achingly sweet . \\n▁ it was too humiliating by half . \\n▁ or it would be if he did it to me . \\n▁ ` ` please , '' i begged on a frantic whisper . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't feed from you here , '' he murmured and with his agreement my relief was so great , my body collapsed into his . \\n▁ my arms went tight around him and i pressed the side of my face to his chest . \\n▁ he bent again , his words stirring the hair on top of my head . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to take you away ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , my cheek sliding against his chest and his hand , still in my hair at the other side of my head , tensed reassuringly then slid away . \\n▁ he took my hand and we were away , leaving the scene behind us , quickly snaking back through the hall . \\n▁ i found my heart was beating wildly . \\n▁ without my panic overcoming my being i felt it . \\n▁ in fact it was beating so hard i fancied i heard it . \\n▁ then i realized what i 'd done and a new panic surged through me . \\n▁ the panic was so strong i yanked at his hand , planted my feet and stopped . \\n▁ lucien stopped with me and looked back at me . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' i cut him off yet again , saying , ` ` i do n't want you to think i ' m a miss xxunk . '' \\n▁ he did n't respond . \\n▁ he just stared at me . \\n▁ i continued , taking a step closer , tipping my head back to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` it was beautiful . \\n▁ those things always are . \\n▁ but they 're also raw . \\n▁ that , particularly , was raw . \\n▁ and revealing . \\n▁ and i do n't want anyone to see me that way . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' he started but i kept on talking . \\n▁ ` ` it 's private and it 's okay if they , '' i looked behind me , throwing my arm toward the hallway we 'd walked through for emphasis before i turned back to him , ` ` want to give and share and … whatever … but , if you do it in front of others , you give it away and it 's not just yours anymore . \\n▁ and i ' m yours , you said so yourself , and i do n't want anyone to have me , not even a little piece of me , not anyone , just you . '' \\n▁ i was so panicked , desperate to give him my explanation , not wanting him to think i was a prude , or worse , to offend him by casting aspersions on his culture , i did n't even realize what i was saying . \\n▁ and furthermore , i did n't mean for it to come out the way it did . \\n▁ but it did . \\n▁ and lucien took it a certain way . \\n▁ i knew this because one second i was standing with my hand in his . \\n▁ the next second i was against the wall , his body was pressed to mine , his hand in my hair yanking my head back in an arc that was painful not only at my neck but in my hair , and his mouth was on mine . \\n▁ this was n't like the kisses we 'd shared before . \\n▁ this one was demanding , bruising , possessive , branding and undeniably savage . \\n▁ and , it might make me a freak , but i loved every , f * * king second of it . \\n▁ his mouth tore from mine and before i could even take a breath , he asked , ` ` you 're mine ? '' \\n▁ i tried to salvage something , anything , ` ` i did n't mean - '' he cut me off with a growl . \\n▁ ` ` you 're mine . '' \\n▁ now what had i gotten myself into ? \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' he had an arm around my waist and it coiled so tight , forcing me so deep against his body , it cut off my breath . \\n▁ ` ` all . \\n▁ fucking . \\n▁ mine , '' he whispered fiercely . \\n▁ i felt my legs go weak and i knew it was not only fear at his ferocious proclamation but also an unhinged desire that i did not want to feel . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , i ca n't breathe , '' i wheezed in all truthfulness but i 'd lost his attention . \\n▁ his head shot to the side and his mouth got tight right before his hold dropped away . \\n▁ i nearly collapsed but his hand seized mine again and he started striding swiftly back toward the club . \\n▁ not long after i saw a couple coming our way down the hall and i knew lucien heard their approach . \\n▁ as they got closer , i noted it was a man and a woman . \\n▁ they were both so gorgeous i had no idea which was the vampire or if they both were -lrb- or were n't -rrb- . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' the man called from several feet away . \\n▁ ` ` jordan , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ it was clear lucien did n't feel like conversing . \\n▁ it was just as clear jordan did for he stopped , halting the striking redheaded woman at his side . \\n▁ her gaze flickered nervously over lucien right before she gave me the once - over and , to my shock , right in front of me , the haughty bitch let her lip curl . \\n▁ i returned the favor but without the lip curl . \\n▁ instead , when lucien stopped , i moved into him . \\n▁ that alone was going to make my point but lucien went one better . \\n▁ his arm slid around my shoulders , brushing my hair with it so it all fell to the front where he mindlessly grabbed a tendril and started twisting it on his finger . \\n▁ even in the dim light , i saw her eyes focus on lucien 's hand and her face went pale . \\n▁ i just stopped myself from giving her a ` ` so there '' grin . \\n▁ i looked up at lucien and saw his eyes were on jordan . \\n▁ i looked at jordan and saw jordan 's eyes were on me . \\n▁ ` ` so this is leah , '' jordan noted . \\n▁ what ? \\n▁ how did he know me ? \\n▁ ` ` it is , '' lucien agreed . \\n▁ jordan 's eyes gave me a once - over too . \\n▁ when they did , the air in the hall went thick and the animosity rolling off lucien was the cause of it . \\n▁ the redhead took a step back , my body involuntarily braced and jordan 's gaze swung to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` easy , lucien , '' jordan said in a low , conciliatory voice . \\n▁ ` ` do n't tell me easy , jordan , '' lucien returned in a low , anything but conciliatory voice . \\n▁ ` ` you 're amongst friends , '' jordan noted and i might have been wrong but it seemed there was deeper meaning to his words than the one that seemed obvious to me . \\n▁ ` ` that might be put to the test , '' lucien retorted . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll pass or i 'll burn , '' jordan replied . \\n▁ they locked eyes and the redhead and i were powerless to do anything but look on and hope they did n't tear each other limb from limb . \\n▁ jordan broke the macho vampire staring contest and he looked again at me . \\n▁ i did n't think this was a good idea but i could n't tell him that . \\n▁ ` ` i can see she 's worth it , '' he muttered , his eyes going back to lucien even as his words made the redhead 's face twist into a pout that i wish i could say was n't pretty but it made her look damnably cute as a button . \\n▁ what i wanted to know , but did n't ask , was what i was worth . \\n▁ it was like they were talking code ! \\n▁ lucien did n't respond to jordan . \\n▁ instead he looked at the redhead . \\n▁ ` ` cecile , '' he murmured . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she whispered in a breathy voice . \\n▁ ` ` now , lucien , you released her , remember ? '' \\n▁ jordan said and his tone was lighthearted but his words felt like a kick to my gut . \\n▁ the redhead looked like she felt the same and this look was not cute as a button at all . \\n▁ it was anguished . \\n▁ she recovered before i did , damn the woman . \\n▁ ` ` i remember . '' \\n▁ she spoke up . \\n▁ jordan turned to me . \\n▁ ` ` he always gets the best ones . \\n▁ luckily , sometimes the rest of us can pick up the scraps . '' \\n▁ everyone tensed then . \\n▁ me in an all of a sudden feeling of camaraderie for my female brethren . \\n▁ lucien because he could be a jerk but i suspected he was a gentleman . \\n▁ cecile because his insult was n't veiled , not in the slightest . \\n▁ ` ` perhaps you should be on your way , '' lucien suggested from between clenched teeth . \\n▁ jordan , clearly a new kind of vampire to me , the demented kind , grinned in the face of certain peril -lrb- namely lucien -rrb- . \\n▁ ` ` perhaps i should . '' \\n▁ his eyes came again to me . \\n▁ ` ` leah , it was a pleasure . '' \\n▁ i did n't know what to do so i simply lifted my chin . \\n▁ this made his grin widen to a smile , he nodded to lucien and he took cecile 's arm and moved to pass us . \\n▁ lucien moved too . \\n▁ keeping me to his side with his arm around my shoulders , he shifted us around and his hand shot out and wrapped around cecile 's upper arm . \\n▁ jordan and cecile stopped . \\n▁ ` ` cecile 's going home , '' lucien declared and i felt my mouth drop open as jordan 's eyes narrowed on lucien 's hand then on lucien . \\n▁ we were almost home free and now foiled by lucien who was also obviously of the demented vampire sort . \\n▁ ` ` i beg your pardon ? '' \\n▁ jordan asked lucien . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , lucien , '' cecile whispered . \\n▁ ` ` do n't do this , '' lucien clipped to cecile . \\n▁ ` ` it 's okay , '' she repeated . \\n▁ lucien dropped his hand but he did n't admit defeat . \\n▁ ` ` your family wo n't agree . '' \\n▁ i watched as her face paled again . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure this is your business , '' jordan butted in , coming closer to the threesome that included lucien , cecile and me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve selected three of her line , not including her , it 's my business , '' lucien returned . \\n▁ ` ` you released her just over a week ago , '' jordan snapped . \\n▁ ` ` you had your fill , you 're out . '' \\n▁ my eyes turned to cecile . \\n▁ this was lucien 's last concubine . \\n▁ i did n't want to meet any of lucien 's concubines but definitely not the gorgeous , willowy redhead that was his last concubine . \\n▁ why did my life suck so much ? \\n▁ why ? \\n▁ however at that moment i suspected cecile 's life sucked more which made my heart go out to her , regardless of the earlier lip curl . \\n▁ lucien ignored jordan and kept focus on cecile . \\n▁ ` ` you know what you lose if you walk down that hall . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' she started . \\n▁ he cut her off . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll take it from you . '' \\n▁ her eyes fell to the floor and she whispered , ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ ` ` go home , '' lucien ordered . \\n▁ her eyes lifted and they were pleading when she repeated , ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ ` ` go home . '' \\n▁ her gaze flitted to me then back to lucien and she pulled her arm free of jordan . \\n▁ ` ` i miss it , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll find someone to give it back to you but not here , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` go home . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't believe this shit , '' jordan hissed . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes cut to jordan . \\n▁ ` ` janette 's at the feeding . \\n▁ if i ' m remembering correctly , she 's your taste . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve had her , '' jordan returned . \\n▁ ` ` have her again , '' lucien clipped back . \\n▁ another macho vampire staring contest ensued and this one was far , far , far more dangerous and definitely scarier than the first . \\n▁ ` ` um … '' i butted in proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that i was indeed deranged as all eyes swung to me and all six of them -lrb- including lucien 's -rrb- were incredulous . \\n▁ ` ` can i just say , '' my gaze went to cecile , i swallowed and xxunk forth . \\n▁ ` ` you 're beautiful . \\n▁ gorgeous . \\n▁ change can suck . \\n▁ trust me , i know . \\n▁ but , honest to god , you 'll find someone the minute you start looking . \\n▁ all you 'll have to do is snap your fingers . \\n▁ sure , he wo n't be able to move at the speed of light and he wo n't feed on human blood but there are always problems in a relationship . \\n▁ am i right ? '' \\n▁ for a second there was complete and total silence and i thought maybe i might have stepped over a line i should never , ever , ever , ever have crossed . \\n▁ i really should have paid attention in vampire studies . \\n▁ i was seeing the error of my ways now . \\n▁ then i was curled forcefully into lucien 's body , his hand in my hair shoving my face in his chest , a chest that was moving , rocking deeply , weirdly , until i figured it out . \\n▁ and i figured it out right before he let out a shout of amused laughter . \\n▁ i relaxed into him and peeked over my shoulder at cecile and jordan . \\n▁ cecile had lost her haughty disdain and was watching me with a look that was astonished at the same time it was sad and confused . \\n▁ jordan was watching me too , a grin playing on his lips and also , to my shock , he looked amused . \\n▁ cecile turned to jordan and asked quietly , ` ` will you be angry if i go home ? '' \\n▁ jordan sighed . \\n▁ ` ` it 'll be a loss , dearest , but by all means , scurry home and save your reputation . '' \\n▁ her look became grateful . \\n▁ it swung to lucien then even to me before she turned and xxunk down the hall . \\n▁ my eyes moved to jordan when he spoke and i realized he was speaking to me . \\n▁ ` ` i hope to see you at another feast . \\n▁ the next time , heading in the other direction . '' \\n▁ ` ` i would n't hold your breath , '' lucien remarked dryly . \\n▁ jordan did n't take his eyes from me when he asked , ` ` she did n't fancy it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not even a little bit , '' lucien answered . \\n▁ ` ` shame , '' jordan muttered . \\n▁ i shivered , lucien 's arm tightened and jordan lifted a hand and then he was gone . \\n▁ just like that . \\n▁ whoosh . \\n▁ one second there , the next second he disappeared . \\n▁ lucien uncurled me from his body and walked me down the hall . \\n▁ this time he did n't take my hand but kept his arm around my shoulders . \\n▁ at the top of the stairs when breed opened the door for us , lucien slipped him a bill . \\n▁ i tried to see what it was but did n't succeed . \\n▁ wats was standing sentry by the car right where we left it . \\n▁ ` ` everything 's fine , master , no one even looked at it , '' he panted , bowing and holding the keys out to lucien who held his hand up and wats dropped the keys in . \\n▁ lucien held the door for me and wats scampered out of the way for him to do so . \\n▁ after lucien closed my door , i spied the one hundred dollar bill lucien slid into wats 's waiting hand . \\n▁ i also saw the shiver of excitement that shook wats 's body and i had the feeling it had nothing to do with the fact that lucien just made him the highest paid car watcher in history but because lucien had almost , but not quite , touched him . \\n▁ we were well away , lucien 's hand back on my thigh after he 'd pulled the material away , but this time no stroking , just proprietary resting . \\n▁ after a while , i could n't help myself , i requested , ` ` may i ask a question ? '' \\n▁ ` ` of course , '' lucien replied instantly . \\n▁ i pulled in a breath and before i could lose my courage , i asked , ` ` you said to cecile you 'd take it away from her . \\n▁ what would you take away ? '' \\n▁ again he answered without hesitation . \\n▁ ` ` her house , her car , her money , everything i give her to keep her . \\n▁ everything i 'll keep giving her until she dies . \\n▁ if she falls , which , you should know leah , any concubine does if they attend a feast after they 're released , i ' m within my rights to cease her keeping . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 'd do that ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` in a second , '' he answered . \\n▁ ` ` my concubines , current or past , do n't participate in feasts . '' \\n▁ i was confused . \\n▁ ` ` but you took me to a feast . '' \\n▁ his hand squeezed my thigh . \\n▁ ` ` to see , to watch , to experience , to be with me amongst my own , not to participate . '' \\n▁ my head turned to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` you were never going to feed ? '' \\n▁ he glanced at me briefly then back to the road before he stated implacably , ` ` never . '' \\n▁ this caused me to feel an extreme sense of relief . \\n▁ then i felt an extreme sense of fear that i felt so relieved . \\n▁ then i felt the extreme desire to cover his hand with mine . \\n▁ then i mentally kicked myself . \\n▁ shortly after , the sleek , high - performance sports car eating the miles serenely beneath me , i fell asleep . \\n▁ chapter nine the lesson i woke for the first time since i 'd been in my new bedroom knowing exactly where i was . \\n▁ but something was n't right . \\n▁ i opened my eyes and saw the big , wide bed empty in front of me . \\n▁ lucien was n't there . \\n▁ elation and disappointment crashed against each other and they caused a very strange sensation that i did n't like one bit . \\n▁ then my mind traveled back to the night before . \\n▁ i thought about the feast and all i 'd seen . \\n▁ then i thought about lucien 's behavior and the conflicting emotions it made me feel . \\n▁ most specifically that i liked being out with him . \\n▁ it was n't what i 'd call a fun date but it was interesting and being on his arm was weirdly thrilling . \\n▁ he acted a complete gentleman -lrb- well , mostly -rrb- and i had n't had that in a long time -lrb- as in , never -rrb- . \\n▁ not to mention his possessive - protective streak , which made me feel safe and if that was n't enough to screw with my head , nothing was . \\n▁ lastly , i thought about falling asleep in the car after lucien assured me he was the kind of vamp who did n't … i went solid and then whipped up the bedclothes and stared at my semi - naked body before pulling the covers back down . \\n▁ i was wearing nothing but a pair of black , lace panties . \\n▁ i fell asleep in the car and that damn vampire carried me upstairs , took off my clothes and put me to bed . \\n▁ in all that he 'd done , and there was a lot that he 'd done , taking off my clothes while i was asleep seemed like the worst -lrb- well , at that moment it did -rrb- . \\n▁ only i was allowed to show my body to who i wanted to show it to when i was in the mood to show it . \\n▁ okay , so it could be argued that he 'd had his tongue in my mouth -lrb- more than once -rrb- , and his hand in my pants -lrb- again more than once -rrb- , and he 'd sucked my blood -lrb- also more than once -rrb- , and he controlled my mind -lrb- way too many times , which meant twice , which was two times too many -rrb- . \\n▁ but this was taking it too far . \\n▁ while my head was preparing to explode , the bedroom door opened and lucien strode in . \\n▁ when i saw him , i was so shocked , my fury vanished and i came up on a forearm to get a better look . \\n▁ he was wearing faded , well - worn jeans and a tight - fitting , long - sleeved white t - shirt . \\n▁ i 'd never seen him in anything but a suit -lrb- and his pajamas , of course -rrb- . \\n▁ and , i 'd never seen him in anything but dark colors . \\n▁ i did n't think he was the type of guy to wear something as everyday normal as jeans and a tee . \\n▁ and he looked good in them . \\n▁ no , great . \\n▁ even better than the suit . \\n▁ phenomenal . \\n▁ my mouth started watering . \\n▁ his eyes went lazy and he grinned . \\n▁ my heart skipped a beat at seeing that look i liked way too damn much about one second before i remembered i hated him and he 'd taken my clothes off me the night before . \\n▁ ` ` you 're awake , '' he commented , walking around the bed while i watched him . \\n▁ i remembered my plan and obedient leah kicked in instantly . \\n▁ the game was afoot . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i answered , clutching the covers to my chest . \\n▁ he stopped at my side and in a flash he 'd plucked me out of the bed , sat on the edge and had me settled in his lap . \\n▁ seeing as i still was n't used to his incomprehensible speed , not to mention i was mostly naked , this freaked me out . \\n▁ luckily , his arms were around me and he was pressing my torso to his chest , hiding my nudity . \\n▁ ` ` did you sleep well , pet ? '' \\n▁ he asked softly in my ear . \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ his lips went to my neck where he muttered , ` ` good . '' \\n▁ then they slid around to my throat . \\n▁ his mouth felt nice , too nice . \\n▁ so nice , i could n't control my tremble . \\n▁ ` ` i like that , '' he muttered against my throat . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ his lips came to mine , his eyes open and watching me as he answered , ` ` when you tremble in my arms . '' \\n▁ what did you say to that ? \\n▁ i did n't know so i just mumbled , ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ i felt his mouth smile against mine . \\n▁ with him in his gentle mood i was losing my will to play games . \\n▁ my will preferred to throw itself bodily at him and rip his fantastic looking jeans and tee off his equally fantastic looking body and have my way with him . \\n▁ in an effort at control , i asked , ` ` did you sleep well ? '' \\n▁ his head moved back a couple of inches and one hand came up , fingers sifting through my hair at my temple and back , pulling it away from my face while his eyes watched . \\n▁ when his fingers had glided the length of my hair down my back , his arm curled around me again and he said , ` ` my first good night 's sleep in the last week . '' \\n▁ this admission surprised me . \\n▁ i could n't imagine anything causing the mighty lucien to lose sleep . \\n▁ it surprised me so much my head tilted to the side and i enquired with genuine curiosity , ` ` why have n't you been sleeping well ? '' \\n▁ his arms grew tighter before he answered , ` ` at first it was anticipation for your bloodletting . \\n▁ after your initiation , it was concern because the wound was n't healing swiftly . \\n▁ then , my pet , i found it difficult sleeping beside you . '' \\n▁ my heart lurched even though my brain reminded it that it should be rejoicing . \\n▁ another collision of sensations that was n't exactly pleasurable . \\n▁ ` ` you have difficulty sleeping with me ? '' \\n▁ my question was a whisper . \\n▁ his hand slid up my na * * d back to capture a lock of hair and i felt him start twisting . \\n▁ this felt nice too . \\n▁ it always did when he did that . \\n▁ ` ` it 's your scent , leah . \\n▁ it 's intoxicating . '' \\n▁ his mouth came to mine and brushed my lips before he pulled back again , a grin tugging the corners of his mouth as he continued , ` ` especially when you 're aroused . \\n▁ your natural scent mixed with the scent of your sex is overpowering . '' \\n▁ my body went stiff and his arms gave me a squeeze before he finished , losing the fight with his smile , ` ` in a good way . '' \\n▁ i examined his arrogant , self - satisfied smile while briefly considering karate chopping him on the shoulder . \\n▁ however , this would probably be as effective as a gnat landing on him . \\n▁ instead , i asked solicitously , ` ` would you prefer if i bathed before going to bed , darling ? '' \\n▁ i saw his eyes flash , i was n't certain if it was anger or amusement , before his head bent to the side and his mouth was again at my neck . \\n▁ ` ` only if i ' m bathing with you , '' he answered . \\n▁ damn . \\n▁ that was a good comeback . \\n▁ ` ` whatever you want , '' i replied dutifully . \\n▁ ` ` mm , '' he murmured effectively , so effectively the timbre slid across my skin , making me shiver . \\n▁ ` ` i like that idea . \\n▁ maybe i 'll only allow you to bathe when you 're with me . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ now what had i done ? \\n▁ i had no choice . \\n▁ i had to go with it . \\n▁ trying to keep my voice even , i enquired , ` ` do you want to do that now ? '' \\n▁ i felt his tongue touch my neck and that made me shiver too . \\n▁ then he said , ` ` not now . \\n▁ i ' m hungry . '' \\n▁ a sudden bolt of electricity slammed between my legs giving me an off the charts happy tingle . \\n▁ he wanted to feed . \\n▁ and i wanted him to feed . \\n▁ i despised that i did but i also could n't deny it . \\n▁ ` ` you 're hungry ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he said against my neck and then lifted his head to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` your choice today , leah , in here or in the kitchen . '' \\n▁ he wanted to feed in the kitchen ? \\n▁ really ? \\n▁ that was crazy ! \\n▁ what if edwina walked in ? \\n▁ ` ` if we do it in the kitchen , what if edwina walks in ? '' \\n▁ his brows drew together . \\n▁ ` ` she 'll have to be there , unless you intend to cook for me . '' \\n▁ ` ` cook for you ? '' \\n▁ i parroted stupidly , finding that idea both intriguing and terrifying . \\n▁ i mean , i know how to cook . \\n▁ and the idea of cooking for lucien was kind of nice even though that admission further proved my insanity . \\n▁ but what if i messed it up ? \\n▁ this i did a lot , especially when i tried something fancy and i doubted lucien ate non - fancy food . \\n▁ and anyway , why were we talking about cooking ? \\n▁ he studied me while these thoughts chased themselves through my head before saying , ` ` you can cook , leah . \\n▁ you can do what you like . \\n▁ it 's your house , not edwina 's . \\n▁ are you saying you want to cook ? '' \\n▁ oh . \\n▁ i got it . \\n▁ ` ` you 're talking about breakfast , '' i breathed in a voice that denoted my mental heel of hand to head slap . \\n▁ he smiled another arrogant , self - satisfied , now even so far as smug smile before he said , ` ` you thought i wanted to feed . '' \\n▁ ` ` erm … '' i wriggled in his lap then remembered i was mostly na * * d so getting away from him would expose my upper body and i was n't ready for that so i stilled . \\n▁ his large hands slid to my h * ps and tensed . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't feed , pet . \\n▁ not until tonight . '' \\n▁ that was news to me . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head saying , ` ` you are n't used to me yet . '' \\n▁ this further confused me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not ? '' \\n▁ the smug smile came back before his face disappeared in my neck again . \\n▁ ` ` we could try . '' \\n▁ oh my . \\n▁ ` ` but you 'd be weak all day and it 's saturday . \\n▁ i have plans for you today . '' \\n▁ he had plans for me . \\n▁ plans that required me not being weak . \\n▁ i did n't know if that was good or not . \\n▁ ` ` plans ? '' \\n▁ one of his hands came up to cup the back of my head and he looked at me again . \\n▁ ` ` first up , another lesson , this time about feeding . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i breathed trying but not quite achieving the feat of not sounding disappointed . \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ damn the vampire ! \\n▁ i tried to look dutiful . \\n▁ it was hard . \\n▁ he studied my face then burst out laughing while he stood , putting me on my feet . \\n▁ he began to set me away from him and , panicked at the idea of baring myself , i latched onto his shoulders and pressed my body against his . \\n▁ his head tilted down to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` close your eyes , '' i whispered before i could stop myself ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um … '' how to do this and be submissive ? \\n▁ ` ` would you please close your eyes , darling ? '' \\n▁ his hands at my waist gave me an impatient squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m nearly naked , '' i explained softly and , i thought , unnecessarily . \\n▁ his hands gave me another squeeze , this time also pulling me even deeper into his body as his head dipped closer . \\n▁ ` ` i saw you last night , pet . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know . '' \\n▁ his face came even closer . \\n▁ ` ` you have a beautiful body , leah . '' \\n▁ my eyes slid to the side . \\n▁ ` ` look at me , '' he demanded . \\n▁ my eyes slid back to his . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want you hiding yourself from me , '' he ordered . \\n▁ ` ` is that an order ? '' \\n▁ i asked just to confirm . \\n▁ ` ` not unless you make it one , '' he answered . \\n▁ what the hell did that mean ? \\n▁ ` ` so , what you 're saying is , you 're not going to close your eyes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ really , he was a jerk . \\n▁ he must have read my thoughts or , since he could n't do that unless i was speaking to him in my thoughts , he must have read my face . \\n▁ therefore he kept talking , ` ` i 'd like to understand why this is an issue . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m naked , '' i explained , again unnecessarily . \\n▁ ` ` and i saw you last night , '' he repeated , his tone stating clearly he thought this was unnecessary too . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't last night anymore . \\n▁ it 's this morning . '' \\n▁ ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the sun is shining , '' i went on . \\n▁ ` ` the sun ? '' \\n▁ he asked ` ` yes . \\n▁ and i ' m awake , '' i continued . \\n▁ his hands slid around to my back as he murmured , ` ` i see . '' \\n▁ ` ` you see what ? '' \\n▁ instead of answering , he said patiently , ` ` i ' ve had my tongue in your mouth . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but - '' ` ` and your blood has filled my mouth . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but - '' ` ` and i ' ve had my hand in your pants . '' \\n▁ this was all sounding familiar . \\n▁ still . \\n▁ ` ` yes , but - '' ` ` and my finger in your - '' ` ` yes ! '' \\n▁ i snapped , cutting him off . \\n▁ ` ` but this is different ! '' \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it just is . '' \\n▁ ` ` explain it to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't ! '' \\n▁ he sighed before stating , ` ` you 're standing mostly na * * d in my arms . \\n▁ i can feel your skin , smell your scent , touch your hair . \\n▁ you 're pressed against me and you 're saying the thought of me seeing your br * * sts makes you uncomfortable even though i ' ve seen them before ? '' \\n▁ that made it sound stupid . \\n▁ i dropped my eyes and looked at his throat . \\n▁ ` ` that makes it sound stupid , '' i said in a small voice . \\n▁ ` ` show yourself to me , leah . '' \\n▁ my eyes snapped back to his . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i breathed . \\n▁ ` ` do it , '' he ordered and it was definitely an order . \\n▁ i could see it in the hard set of his jaw and the intensity of his eyes . \\n▁ i really had to make certain lighter fluid was on edwina 's grocery list . \\n▁ doing my best to be obedient leah , i pushed against his arms at my waist to take a step back . \\n▁ he did n't let me go . \\n▁ he kept his arms around me so i was forced to arch my back . \\n▁ i looked away the minute his eyes dropped down . \\n▁ it was only a second before i was again pressed against him , his hand in my hair , cupping my head and putting pressure there so my cheek was against his chest . \\n▁ he bent so he was talking into the hair on top of my head when he spoke again softly , ` ` that was n't so hard , was it ? '' \\n▁ actually , it was n't . \\n▁ but i 'd never give him that . \\n▁ so instead , in my most obvious , well - behaved voice , i agreed , ` ` no , darling . \\n▁ it was n't . '' \\n▁ i felt his body go solid and his hand in my hair twisted before he noted , ` ` you try me , pet . '' \\n▁ good , i thought . \\n▁ his hand tugged back , taking my head with it so i was looking up at him . \\n▁ ` ` you 're lucky i enjoy it . '' \\n▁ his voice was a warning . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ he enjoyed it . \\n▁ boy , i was lucky . \\n▁ ` ` put on a robe , meet me downstairs . \\n▁ we 'll have breakfast in the kitchen , '' he commanded before he touched his lips to mine and let me go . \\n▁ i nearly flew to the bathroom and it took all my effort not to slam the door . \\n▁ ` ` is there something particular you want for breakfast ? '' \\n▁ he called through the closed door as i slid on my robe . \\n▁ ` ` whatever you want , '' i called back and then stuck my tongue out at the door . \\n▁ ` ` i saw that , leah . '' \\n▁ i heard him say and he did n't sound like i was trying him anymore . \\n▁ he sounded amused . \\n▁ i did n't care if he sounded amused . \\n▁ my mind and body froze . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i called between stiff lips . \\n▁ the door opened , i jumped and lucien crossed his arms on his chest and leaned against its frame . \\n▁ ` ` i saw it , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` but … i thought , '' i stammered then breathed , ` ` you can see through doors ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i ca n't see through doors . \\n▁ you were speaking to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i was gesturing to you . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` same thing . '' \\n▁ i stayed silent . \\n▁ this was not good news . \\n▁ ` ` this new game is fun , '' he noted , freaking me way the hell out . \\n▁ ` ` almost better than the other one . '' \\n▁ i tried innocence . \\n▁ ` ` what game ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head , his hand shot out , curled around the back of my neck and he pulled me in so he could kiss the top of my head . \\n▁ when he let me go he said , ` ` time for your lesson . \\n▁ i 'll meet you downstairs . '' \\n▁ without another word , he turned and was gone . \\n▁ i stared at the still open door of the bedroom . \\n▁ then i screamed . \\n▁ but only in my mind . \\n▁ and since i was screaming because of lucien , i really hoped he could n't hear . \\n▁ * * * * * i took my sweet time doing my morning business and sauntered downstairs to the kitchen . \\n▁ edwina was at the stove . \\n▁ lucien was nowhere to be seen . \\n▁ ` ` hey , edwina , '' i called . \\n▁ ` ` hello , dear . '' \\n▁ edwina threw a smile over her shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` did you have fun last night ? '' \\n▁ i wrinkled my nose . \\n▁ she smiled then shook her head , muttering with distaste , ` ` feasts . '' \\n▁ she turned back to whatever she was doing and i strolled to the coffeepot . \\n▁ ` ` you want a refresh ? '' \\n▁ i asked , reaching for her empty mug . \\n▁ ` ` please . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll take one too , leah , '' lucien said , striding into the kitchen and i just barely controlled my glare . \\n▁ ` ` of course , darling , '' i murmured to the cabinet with the coffee mugs , taking two down . \\n▁ ` ` black , three sugars , '' lucien continued . \\n▁ he took three sugars ? \\n▁ it really was too bad that vampires did n't get diabetes and at that moment i did n't care how unkind that thought was . \\n▁ i measured three , gargantuan , heaping teaspoons of sugar into lucien 's coffee , splashed mine with milk , asked edwina her preference and then passed them around . \\n▁ i took my mug and went to sit on one of the stools . \\n▁ ` ` lucien 's ordered poached eggs on toast , leah . \\n▁ what would you like ? '' \\n▁ edwina asked . \\n▁ i avoided looking at lucien and replied , ` ` i 'll have whatever lucien 's having . '' \\n▁ i felt lucien turn to me but i continued to ignore him . \\n▁ edwina stayed busy at the huge , stainless steel , restaurant quality stove and offered , ` ` it 's no bother . \\n▁ i 'll make whatever you like . '' \\n▁ finally i turned to lucien , ` ` what would you like me to eat , darling ? '' \\n▁ lucien 's gaze locked with mine but he did n't speak . \\n▁ i tried to keep my face attentive and expectant like his decision on my morning meal was the reason for my being . \\n▁ finally he enquired , ` ` do you like poached eggs ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to like poached eggs ? '' \\n▁ i returned on a breathy exhale . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to tell me if you like poached eggs , '' he retorted . \\n▁ we had a short staring contest but his black eyes were too much for me and i turned away . \\n▁ ` ` i like poached eggs , '' i replied demurely . \\n▁ lucien looked at edwina . \\n▁ ` ` she 'll have poached eggs . '' \\n▁ edwina 's gaze was drifting back and forth between lucien and me . \\n▁ then she bit her lip -lrb- and i could swear it was to hide a smile -rrb- and turned back to the stove . \\n▁ lucien took a sip of his coffee . \\n▁ i watched him under my lashes as i took a sip from mine . \\n▁ ` ` the grocery list is on the counter , dear , right in front of you . '' \\n▁ edwina was saying . \\n▁ ` ` i have saturday and sunday afternoons off as well as all day monday . \\n▁ so anything you want to cook or have in the house , write it down . \\n▁ i ' m going to the store after breakfast . '' \\n▁ i was wondering if they sold gallon jugs of gasoline at the grocery store -lrb- or flame throwers -rrb- when lucien walked to the sink , poured out his coffee and walked to the coffeemaker . \\n▁ i just stopped myself from grinning . \\n▁ edwina stared at him in horror , a stainless steel spoon any television chef would give one of their kidneys for held aloft . \\n▁ ` ` is it too weak ? '' \\n▁ lucien poured himself another cup . \\n▁ ` ` it 's fine . \\n▁ but leah has a heavy hand with the sugar . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh dear , i did n't do it right ? '' \\n▁ i chirped , sounding devastated , like someone ran over the beloved cat that i 'd had since childhood . \\n▁ lucien turned to me . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember what your behavior bought you when you disobeyed me ? '' \\n▁ oh i remembered all right . \\n▁ boy did i remember . \\n▁ i clenched my teeth and nodded my head once . \\n▁ ` ` you could get more of that before breakfast , '' lucien went on . \\n▁ ` ` would you like that ? '' \\n▁ lucien turning me on to the point my body screamed for release and then leaving me wanting ? \\n▁ no . \\n▁ i did n't want that . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ he calmly took a sip of his coffee . \\n▁ edwina thankfully pretended she had n't heard a thing . \\n▁ i pulled the grocery list to me and started to read it . \\n▁ all of a sudden i felt lucien behind me , the heat from his chest against my back as he leaned over me . \\n▁ i detested a lot of things about him . \\n▁ his recent behavior was one shining example . \\n▁ when he went all nearly breaking the sound barrier vampire was another . \\n▁ ` ` tonight , i want you to make your fried chicken for me , '' he ordered . \\n▁ my mind cleared of the latest humiliating lucien encounter and i twisted my neck to look up at him , dumbfounded . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ his eyes caught mine . \\n▁ ` ` your fried chicken . '' \\n▁ my fried chicken ? \\n▁ i did , of course , make great fried chicken . \\n▁ the best . \\n▁ it was one of my only real talents . \\n▁ but how the hell would he know that ? \\n▁ a weird chill ran up my spine . \\n▁ ` ` how do you know about my fried chicken ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ his chin motioned to the pad of paper on the table and he did n't answer my question . \\n▁ instead he commanded , ` ` put the ingredients down . '' \\n▁ ` ` how do you - ? '' \\n▁ ` ` just write down the ingredients , leah . '' \\n▁ i gaped at him . \\n▁ then i considered my recipe , which required at least overnight marinating of the chicken in my famous buttermilk marinade . \\n▁ it would n't be near as good without time to marinade . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't , '' i told him . \\n▁ his eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` no , really , i ca n't . \\n▁ it 's the marinade . \\n▁ it needs at least … '' i looked at the clock on the microwave , it was nearly ten , ` ` eight hours of xxunk ! '' \\n▁ my voice was rising dramatically but what could i say ? \\n▁ i had a fried chicken reputation to keep up . \\n▁ every woman knew how important that was . \\n▁ ` ` and even that is n't optimal . \\n▁ anything less just is n't worth it . \\n▁ i do n't even have eight hours ! '' \\n▁ he grinned , i caught it close up and my heart skipped . \\n▁ but he was relentless . \\n▁ ` ` put the ingredients down . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien ! '' \\n▁ ` ` you can make it for me tomorrow night . '' \\n▁ oh . \\n▁ right . \\n▁ tomorrow night would give me plenty of time . \\n▁ i could do that . \\n▁ i wrote the ingredients down . \\n▁ edwina served up poached eggs on toast with crisp fried bacon . \\n▁ lucien had three eggs . \\n▁ i had only two . \\n▁ i wanted to ask for another egg -lrb- or two -rrb- , seeing as i was still on course to gain as much weight as possible to turn lucien off my ` ` beautiful body '' but i felt i 'd tried his patience enough for one morning . \\n▁ he sat beside me and we ate while edwina tidied the kitchen and i wrote stuff down on the grocery list . \\n▁ i omitted the flame thrower . \\n▁ when the laptop in the bedroom had broadband , something i discovered the day before it did n't , i 'd see if i could order one online . \\n▁ edwina whisked the plates out from under us when we were done , rinsed them , put them in the dishwasher and did a rub down of all the countertops while lucien and i sipped at our final drops of coffee . \\n▁ it was weird having a housekeeper . \\n▁ it was even weirder living in a rambling mansion in the middle of nowhere . \\n▁ in my ex - life i lived in a two bedroom condo in the city and although i did n't do too badly career - wise , i did n't have a housekeeper . \\n▁ i had been a media specialist , a field in which i 'd never get a job again considering i gave them two whole days notice . \\n▁ though i did n't have to worry about that since lucien would be taking care of me for the rest of my natural born life , something else that sucked . \\n▁ my condo was excellently situated . \\n▁ i could walk anywhere to get anything i needed . \\n▁ bars , takeaway pizza , movie theaters , grocery stores . \\n▁ my condo had enough room not to feel like i lived in a cave but not too much where it would take all weekend to clean or i could accumulate too much stuff which i had a habit of doing . \\n▁ luckily , although edwina was a bit strange , i liked her and her living with me made the big house seem less monstrous . \\n▁ still , i missed my little place . \\n▁ i 'd lived there for ten years . \\n▁ i 'd made every inch of it mine . \\n▁ i liked it . \\n▁ on that thought , i heard the backdoor close heralding edwina 's departure -lrb- further heralded by her calling out ` ` good - bye '' -rrb- , and i came back to the room . \\n▁ ` ` time for your lesson , pet . '' \\n▁ i looked at lucien in time for him to take my hand . \\n▁ he pulled me off the stool and walked me to the comfy seating area . \\n▁ with me standing in front of him , he sat on the big , fluffy couch then grabbed my hips , pulling me off my feet . \\n▁ he fell to the side , twisted to his back with me on top , partially falling off his side , my back to the back of the couch . \\n▁ why we needed to be lying pressed together on the couch for my lesson , i did n't know . \\n▁ obedient leah also did n't ask even though she wanted to . \\n▁ i just looked at him expectantly like whatever wisdom he was about to share would soothe my savaged soul . \\n▁ his eyes roamed my face . \\n▁ then he whispered , ` ` you 're adorable . '' \\n▁ not that again . \\n▁ i was trying to be annoying . \\n▁ it just was n't working . \\n▁ ` ` my lesson ? '' \\n▁ i prompted . \\n▁ he smiled . \\n▁ my heart skipped another beat . \\n▁ his smile grew arrogant . \\n▁ with effort i contained my frustrated growl . \\n▁ he burst out laughing , his arms closed around me and he hugged me close . \\n▁ ` ` are we going to hug or are you going to teach me vampire knowledge ? '' \\n▁ i asked , trying not to sound as annoyed as i was . \\n▁ ` ` we 're going to do both , '' he replied , his arms loosening but not letting go . \\n▁ whatever . \\n▁ i lifted my head again and looked at him . \\n▁ his eyes caught mine . \\n▁ ` ` feeding , '' he started and my ears perked up because i was interested in spite of myself . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember the other night when i kissed you and your mouth tingled ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` that was the anesthesia , '' he explained . \\n▁ ` ` it releases when my body prepares to feed . \\n▁ if i 'd kissed you harder , longer , more frequently , your mouth would have gone numb . '' \\n▁ i did n't like the sound of that . \\n▁ he was a good kisser and if my mouth was numb i 'd miss all the fun . \\n▁ he kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` also , when my body prepares to feed , the healing properties in my saliva release . \\n▁ they permeate your skin when i prepare it for the wound and they infiltrate the wound while i ' m feeding so it 's healing even as i feed . '' \\n▁ as with all things vampire , this made sense so i nodded again . \\n▁ lucien continued , ` ` those healing properties stay in your bloodstream . \\n▁ they help your blood regenerate . \\n▁ even after your first bloodletting , they were working . \\n▁ no mortal could have lost that much blood without a transfusion but after a couple of days rest , you were back to normal . \\n▁ the longer i feed , the more healing agents are released into your bloodstream , the quicker you recover . \\n▁ in a week , i can feed once a day . \\n▁ in two , i can feed more than once a day . \\n▁ in three weeks , i can feed whenever i like . '' \\n▁ this also made sense . \\n▁ however , i was stuck on the idea of him feeding whenever he liked . \\n▁ ` ` how much do you need to feed ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` the same as anyone . \\n▁ three times a day . '' \\n▁ i felt my eyes grow wide and my lips part . \\n▁ through my shock , i also saw his gaze scan my face and for some reason his face gentled when he caught sight of my expression . \\n▁ ` ` food , the food you eat , gives me nourishment , '' he went on to explain . \\n▁ ` ` just as it does for you , and my body needs it , just as yours does . \\n▁ however , the nutrients in mortal 's food are n't near enough to sustain my body 's energy , to keep it functioning . \\n▁ therefore , i need something more . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you 're feeding every other day , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` are you saying that , right now , you 're fasting for more than a day ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ i 'd tried fasting when i was on some crazy diet years ago . \\n▁ i could n't last until dinner . \\n▁ i could n't imagine going for more than a day ! \\n▁ ` ` are you hungry ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` not as much as when i fasted for a week but yes , i am . '' \\n▁ i could n't believe this . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't understand . \\n▁ why would the rules do this to vampires when they change concubines ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the rules only state i ca n't feed between the release of one and the initiation of another . \\n▁ once you 're initiated , i ' m free to attend feasts . '' \\n▁ i felt my stomach twist at the idea of lucien going to a feast . \\n▁ feeding on some random mortal . \\n▁ touching her . \\n▁ making her feel what he made me feel . \\n▁ giving her what he gave me -lrb- before he took it away -rrb- . \\n▁ but last night at the feast , he did n't feed . \\n▁ i swallowed hard before asking , ` ` are you going to feasts , um , in between - ? '' \\n▁ ` ` normally , i would , however , with you i have n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ his arms gave me a squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` if you taste the finest wine , leah , you want another glass and if it takes a while to get it you 're content to wait . \\n▁ you do n't switch to lemonade no matter how sweet that lemonade might be or how thirsty you may get . '' \\n▁ it was the weirdest compliment i 'd ever been given . \\n▁ it was also , somehow , the most profound . \\n▁ i really did n't know how to respond so i said , ` ` oh . '' \\n▁ his hand slid up my back and started to play with my hair . \\n▁ ` ` there 's more . '' \\n▁ i tilted my head to the side , trying not to dislodge his hand from my hair . \\n▁ i knew i should n't like him playing with my hair but i did . \\n▁ he went on , ` ` as time passes and the healing properties stay in your bloodstream , they do other things to you as well . '' \\n▁ i felt my body tense . \\n▁ ` ` like what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it takes a while , years , but they 'll start regenerating your body , your organs , your skin , your hair , everything . \\n▁ they help you fight off infection . \\n▁ they help any injury you should sustain to heal swiftly . \\n▁ they even ward off disease . \\n▁ it 's more but , to put it simply , in essence , you 'll be aging backward . '' \\n▁ at his words , i gasped . \\n▁ finally , a bonus for being a concubine ! \\n▁ ` ` you 're joking , '' i breathed but i hoped he was n't . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ for it to happen , a vampire has to keep his concubine for some time and feed regularly . \\n▁ it takes at least a year before this process begins , sometimes two or even three . '' \\n▁ his eyes locked on mine and he asked , ` ` did n't you ever wonder why your mother and aunts look so much younger than they really are ? '' \\n▁ i just thought it was the strict xxunk regime they forced on my sister and me and all the cousins . \\n▁ i had no idea it was vampire saliva regeneration . \\n▁ how weird . \\n▁ how cool ! \\n▁ he must have read my face because he chuckled . \\n▁ ` ` i see you like that . '' \\n▁ i could n't hide my exuberant response . \\n▁ ` ` what 's not to like ? '' \\n▁ his chuckle stopped but his handsome grin stayed in place as his hand twisted possessively in my hair . \\n▁ ` ` nothing . \\n▁ there 's absolutely nothing not to like , '' he murmured . \\n▁ i did n't know for certain what he was referring to but i felt it essential to stay on target . \\n▁ i was liking this lesson , liking it a lot . \\n▁ ` ` how much age will i lose ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that depends on how long our arrangement lasts , how much i feed . \\n▁ it 's important to note the healing heals . \\n▁ it does n't start a regression to childhood . \\n▁ it does n't undo growth or mental capacity . \\n▁ you 'll lose years of cell and organ aging , maybe more . \\n▁ but you 'll always be an adult . '' \\n▁ this was getting better and better . \\n▁ i did n't exactly want to go back to my teen years . \\n▁ they sucked enough the first time . \\n▁ he slid out from under me and to his side so we were face - to - face . \\n▁ i caught his expression and it had grown serious . \\n▁ ` ` before the revolution , '' he paused and asked , ` ` did you at least learn about the revolution before you were expelled ? '' \\n▁ i had . \\n▁ the vampire revolution was where this concubine business , and the rules and laws that governed vampires , all started , which was pretty much where the vampire studies syllabus started . \\n▁ in a nutshell , in xxunk the vampires revolted in a bloody , xxunk -lrb- and then some -rrb- battle which was almost fully contained in london . \\n▁ history knew it as the great plague which was a story parliament , king charles ii and the vampire dominion agreed would be spread . \\n▁ it was , instead , vampires fighting their own , an offshoot vampire sect who had allied themselves with mortals . \\n▁ i was fuzzy on the details of why the vampires revolted but they did and it was n't a pretty scene . \\n▁ the offshoot sect won . \\n▁ the great fire of london did n't herald the end of the plague . \\n▁ it was an enormous vampire execution that got out of hand and burned down a lot of london . \\n▁ it also heralded the official end of the vampire revolution and the beginning of the terms of agreement between immortal and mortal . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i answered lucien 's question . \\n▁ he pulled me closer and his voice dipped lower . \\n▁ ` ` before the revolution , it was n't unusual for vampires to take mortal mates . '' \\n▁ this was shocking news as another thing i 'd caught in the moments i paid attention in class was that vampires mated , as in pledged their troth , with vampires , period , dot , the end . \\n▁ not mortals . \\n▁ never . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` how did that work , considering vampires are immortal ? \\n▁ i mean , it would stink to be forever young and your partner … '' i trailed off and my eyes grew wide . \\n▁ he noticed my dawning comprehension and pulled me even closer . \\n▁ ` ` that 's right , leah . \\n▁ back then it was n't unusual for vampires to keep their mortal mates alive for centuries . \\n▁ the healing is strong and , if constant , meant a vastly elongated life for the mortal , even going so far as making a mortal immortal should it have continued indefinitely . \\n▁ if feeding ceased , it would take years before the properties were fully expunged from the mortal 's system , they would n't age for some time . \\n▁ once they did , their normal aging process would begin again as usual . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' i whispered , overwhelmed by this stunning news . \\n▁ lucien ignored my reaction and kept with his lesson . \\n▁ ` ` after the revolution , the immortal and mortal agreement prohibited inter - cultural unions . \\n▁ all vampires who had them where ordered to release their mortal mates . '' \\n▁ i stared at him in renewed , now horrified , astonishment . \\n▁ i could n't believe it . \\n▁ i could n't imagine being with someone , maybe for centuries , and all of a sudden being forced to part . \\n▁ something about this made tears sting my eyes . \\n▁ ` ` that 's terrible . '' \\n▁ ` ` it was , '' he murmured , his tone stating eloquently that he agreed . \\n▁ ` ` it also did n't go over very well . \\n▁ all of them refused . \\n▁ thus began the hunt , which is an ugly piece of our history they do n't teach you in class . '' \\n▁ i did n't think i wanted to know . \\n▁ lucien told me anyway . \\n▁ ` ` all vampires and their mortal mates were hunted . \\n▁ every last one . \\n▁ when caught , they were tortured until they denounced the relationship . \\n▁ if they did n't , which was most often the case , they were executed . '' \\n▁ i could n't process this . \\n▁ it was too hideous . \\n▁ ` ` both of them ? '' \\n▁ i breathed . \\n▁ he shook his head but answered , ` ` sometimes , yes . \\n▁ sometimes it was just the vampire , other times , it was the mortal . '' \\n▁ the tears in my eyes clogged my throat and i forced them down in a painful swallow . \\n▁ lucien continued , ` ` it has served for centuries as a powerful lesson to any vampire who might wish to cross that line . '' \\n▁ as it would ! \\n▁ ` ` i do n't like this lesson , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't a nice lesson , pet , '' he agreed . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't understand why they did that ! '' \\n▁ i returned hotly . \\n▁ ` ` why would they do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` survival of the species , both mine and yours . \\n▁ we ca n't survive without you . \\n▁ and a vampire and mortal can not procreate . \\n▁ further , at the time , vampires hunted for their food . \\n▁ mortals were prey , literally , and vampires were feared greatly . \\n▁ for millennia , vampires lived underground , not out in the open , many mortals did n't even believe in us . \\n▁ we were considered unreal monsters , too vile to allow the fragile mortal mind to believe existed . \\n▁ it was in a time where many fed without stopping , leaving their victims dead , so there was a great deal to fear . \\n▁ we were largely nocturnal . \\n▁ we were entirely predators and most were highly content with this life . '' \\n▁ okay , it was safe to say he was freaking me out . \\n▁ he either did n't notice or did n't care because he continued . \\n▁ ` ` then there was a shift of sensibilities that led to the revolution . \\n▁ there were vampires who were growing tired of living in the shadows , saw the advantages of eternal life and wished to exploit them . \\n▁ those vampires over the centuries acquired great wealth , sophistication and started to move within the mortal world . \\n▁ they became vastly more civilized than the predatory vampire , even going so far as having what are now concubines , without contracts of course and without the limit of one at a time . \\n▁ many of those vampires had several concubines , sometimes dozens . '' \\n▁ ` ` is this covered in class ? '' \\n▁ i interrupted and lucien shook his head in answer to my question and kept telling his story . \\n▁ ` ` other vampires preferred their life as hunters and felt this growing section of our culture who wished for something more was threatening their way of life . \\n▁ and they were correct . \\n▁ this was the reason for the revolution . \\n▁ the vampires who wished more from life allied themselves with mortals and fought the predatory vampires . \\n▁ the union of vampires and mortals , the one that orchestrated the agreement after the revolution , felt there needed to be strictures governing the interaction between our cultures . \\n▁ their intentions were sound , even just . \\n▁ the priority was to protect our prey and protect our species by facilitating vampire xxunk or , in mortal terms , marriage . \\n▁ even vampires do n't often procreate , it 's difficult but it 's impossible with a mortal . \\n▁ for our species to thrive , they thrust these edicts on us . '' \\n▁ i had a million questions . \\n▁ maybe even a million and two . \\n▁ as was necessary , i started with one . \\n▁ ` ` why do you need to procreate when you do n't die ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we die . \\n▁ sometimes accidentally , a house fire , for example . \\n▁ but usually , it 's suicide . \\n▁ eternal life is n't for everyone . '' \\n▁ i sucked in a shocked breath and lucien continued softly , ` ` it 's an honorable death , leah . \\n▁ not frowned upon in any way . \\n▁ eternal life can get trying . '' \\n▁ i nodded because that , too , made a weird kind of sense . \\n▁ ` ` then there are the executions for those who break the rules , mostly if they hunt . \\n▁ this does n't happen often . \\n▁ and lastly , there are the rights vampires have against their own . \\n▁ for instance , if a concubine is misused by another vampire , her vampire can exact retribution which can come in the form of assassination . '' \\n▁ i knew that last already . \\n▁ stephanie told me , including the fact that lucien had conducted two such assassinations himself . \\n▁ something occurred to me then . \\n▁ something i knew but had n't thought about . \\n▁ something that made me feel like my blood had turned to hot lava , an intensely uncomfortable sensation . \\n▁ i did n't want to ask , i really did n't , but i found myself doing it anyway . \\n▁ ` ` do you and your , er … '' i tried not to choke on the word and luckily succeeded , ` ` mate have any children ? '' \\n▁ for some reason i hated thinking about him having a mate . \\n▁ essentially a wife somewhere out there staking claim to him on a level i would never have . \\n▁ why i felt this way , i had no clue and it scared me most of all . \\n▁ he shook his head but i did n't feel relief . \\n▁ his next words , spoken so casually they were careless , cemented this feeling further . \\n▁ ` ` not with katrina , no . \\n▁ from two separate unions long ago , i created a son , julian , and a daughter , isobel , both live in england . '' \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ lucien was a father . \\n▁ i could n't wrap my head around that concept at all . \\n▁ my eyes shifted away from him when i queried , ` ` do you talk to them ? '' \\n▁ ` ` frequently . '' \\n▁ i kept my eyes averted . \\n▁ ` ` are you close ? '' \\n▁ ` ` very . '' \\n▁ ` ` do you , um … keep in touch with their mothers ? '' \\n▁ why was i asking these questions ? \\n▁ he did n't hesitate with his reply . \\n▁ ` ` isobel 's mother took her life thirty years ago . '' \\n▁ my eyes snapped back to his face but there was no expression there , no sadness or remorse . \\n▁ he continued , ` ` i still speak with , and sometimes see , cressida , julian 's mother . '' \\n▁ i did n't want to be talking about this anymore . \\n▁ and in hopes of ending the discussion and my lesson which had started out great but took a turn for the worse , i asked no further questions and simply said , ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ for a moment , lucien examined my face . \\n▁ then he asked quietly , ` ` have you had enough , pet ? '' \\n▁ i 'd had enough . \\n▁ boy , had i had enough . \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` do you have any questions ? '' \\n▁ he offered and i shook my head . \\n▁ this was a lie . \\n▁ i still had a million questions none of which i wanted answers to at that moment . \\n▁ the top of the list was the existence of katrina . \\n▁ who she was . \\n▁ where she was . \\n▁ what she thought about me . \\n▁ how long they 'd been together and why lucien was in my bed at night , his clothes in my dressing room , his body lying with me at this very moment on the couch he provided for me . \\n▁ though i knew i definitely did n't want the answer to any of that . \\n▁ as i was sorting through this new mess in my brain , his head lifted and his face disappeared in my neck . \\n▁ ` ` all right , sweetheart . \\n▁ lesson over . '' \\n▁ i shivered mainly because his deep voice sounded against the sensitive skin of my neck and that felt nice . \\n▁ also because , after he stopped speaking , his tongue tasted me there and that felt nicer . \\n▁ finally because he called me ` ` sweetheart '' and i liked it when he did that . \\n▁ in an effort at self - preservation , to end my body 's betraying response and in an attempt to take some control of the situation , i asked , ` ` can i get dressed ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ i blinked . \\n▁ ` ` no ? '' \\n▁ i queried and my voice sounded breathy . \\n▁ his mouth traveled up my neck , over my jaw to meet my lips . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ i ' ve decided you 'll be na * * d most of today . '' \\n▁ what ? \\n▁ my mind screamed . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ my mouth whispered . \\n▁ i felt his smile against my lips . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll be naked . \\n▁ obviously you ' ve learned your lesson and decided to mind me . \\n▁ that deserves a reward . '' \\n▁ his voice dipped lower when he informed me , ` ` and i ' m going to spend all day giving you that reward . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ now what had i done ? \\n▁ the game i 'd instigated had taken a nasty turn . \\n▁ and this was because he played it far better than me . \\n▁ damn the vampire ! \\n▁ ` ` lucien … '' i started but his hand hit my bare thigh , roving upwards under my robe to cup my bottom . \\n▁ he interrupted my concentration on the movement of his hand by demanding , ` ` kiss me , pet . '' \\n▁ ` ` kiss you ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i want your tongue in my mouth . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' i started again but he cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` you intend to disobey me ? '' \\n▁ his tone sounded like a gentle threat or possibly a challenge . \\n▁ what did i do now ? \\n▁ my choices were to be obedient leah and kiss him or be real leah and likely get punishment . \\n▁ i was screwed ! \\n▁ ` ` can we - ? '' \\n▁ i began yet again only to be interrupted again . \\n▁ ` ` kiss me , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` just give me two - '' his hand pressed my h * ps against his and i could feel he was hard . \\n▁ my body registered that i liked it that he was hard , that i could make him hard just by lying beside him and talking . \\n▁ that may have been what my body registered but my mind registered complete and utter fear . \\n▁ i watched his eyes grow dark and intense . \\n▁ then he growled , ` ` do what i say or - '' i cut him off this time and kissed him . \\n▁ the minute my tongue touched his , per usual , i wondered why i 'd struggled against it . \\n▁ both our heads slanted to opposite sides . \\n▁ our tongues dueled , both fighting for supremacy , taking , taking , taking , so hungry , at the same time giving so much i felt my body consumed with the gift of his kiss . \\n▁ it was glorious . \\n▁ my back arched , pressing my torso into his , seeking maximum contact but he pulled away . \\n▁ his hand moving between us , he yanked at the tie on my robe , shifting it aside . \\n▁ his hand slid across my waist , up my back , pressing in , my sensitive na * * d torso flattened against his massive , hard , tee - covered chest . \\n▁ it felt great . \\n▁ his mouth broke from mine and he demanded in a husky voice , ` ` wrap your leg around my waist . \\n▁ i want to smell you . '' \\n▁ his demand caused my belly to dip and a rush of heat to surge between my legs . \\n▁ i did as i was told , biting my lip , feeling both desire and embarrassment all of this mingled with fear , of him , of what we were doing , of what it meant that i responded to him so strongly even though i despised him so thoroughly . \\n▁ when my calf curled around his ass , his eyes grew unfocused . \\n▁ ` ` fucking hell , '' he muttered and his gaze caught mine , still fogged . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't wait to have my mouth on you , to have the taste of you on my tongue , to have that scent take over my world . '' \\n▁ that was the second weirdest , yet most profound , compliment i 'd ever had . \\n▁ i had no time to let it sink in . \\n▁ he was kissing me , harder , more demanding , more beautiful than the last . \\n▁ his hands moved on me , mine moved on him , yanking up his tee so they could move skin against skin . \\n▁ his body felt amazing beneath my touch . \\n▁ hard , silken , strong , massive , defined . \\n▁ his mouth tore from mine but his lips slid down my cheek , scoring a delicious path over my jaw , neck , down , making me tremble . \\n▁ ` ` offer your breast to me , '' he ordered , mouth at my chest and i was so deep in my own sensual fog , his question confused me . \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ his lips moved away and he pulled up , his eyes locking with mine . \\n▁ ` ` i want you to offer me your breast . '' \\n▁ his command sliced through my arousal . \\n▁ i did n't know what he meant . \\n▁ was he going to feed on me there like i 'd seen the vampire do last night ? \\n▁ or was he going to do something else ? \\n▁ both of which i wanted . \\n▁ both of which terrified me . \\n▁ i swallowed . \\n▁ his eyes scanned my face before he asked softly , ` ` what 's this ? '' \\n▁ i stared at him and it hit me that he looked strangely hopeful . \\n▁ ` ` maybe this is going a little fast for me , '' i tried . \\n▁ and failed . \\n▁ his expression shifted , not angry or impatient but pleased . \\n▁ very pleased . \\n▁ even , if it could be credited , relieved . \\n▁ and stimulated . \\n▁ or , more stimulated . \\n▁ ` ` you deny me ? '' \\n▁ he whispered sounding like he hoped i did . \\n▁ ` ` um … '' ` ` offer me your breast , leah , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` er … '' ` ` cup it in your hand and offer it to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` could n't we just , you know , carry on like before , natural - like ? '' \\n▁ i suggested . \\n▁ he shook his head and his arms stole around me , tensing fiercely , crushing me to him . \\n▁ ` ` today , if it takes all day , if it takes into tomorrow , if it takes the next month , you 'll learn to submit to me . \\n▁ you 'll learn to give me what i want when i ask for it . \\n▁ you 'll learn to offer me what i desire when i demand it . \\n▁ you 'll learn to beg me for your own release when i require it . '' \\n▁ i felt my temper rise . \\n▁ really , he was such a jerk . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think - '' ` ` give me your breast , pet . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien , seriously . '' \\n▁ ` ` do it ! '' \\n▁ he snarled , his voice turning dangerous , his patience waning . \\n▁ obedient leah evaporated and real leah glared . \\n▁ ` ` you want it , take it ! \\n▁ i ' m not giving you anything , '' i snarled back . \\n▁ he rolled into me , his massive weight crushing me to the couch and , for some unhinged reason , regardless of the fact we were locked in our usual battle , i found i was wrong about his patience waning . \\n▁ it had been a test . \\n▁ a test i failed . \\n▁ a battle he won . \\n▁ and he looked triumphant . \\n▁ ` ` i was hoping you 'd say that , '' he muttered . \\n▁ great ! \\n▁ then it began , my punishment for disobeying - his hands on me , his mouth on me everywhere , hard , hot , ravenous , demanding my response and getting it in spades . \\n▁ he lit me on fire . \\n▁ i fought it but i did n't win . \\n▁ my defenses were puny and they collapsed within minutes . \\n▁ i pulled up his tee and he took over , arching away from me , tearing it over his head and tossing it aside . \\n▁ with all his delicious skin exposed , a craving so intense it felt like it would shatter me tore through my system . \\n▁ my mouth sought anywhere it could touch , taste , lick , bite , suck and i liked the way he tasted . \\n▁ no , i adored it . \\n▁ when we kissed again , my fingers curled into his hair , holding him to me like i 'd never let him go . \\n▁ he broke our kiss and his mouth traveled the length of me , pushing the robe wide , exposing me to him and i did n't try to hide . \\n▁ i kept my fingers in his hair as he explored , tempting , pressing for a reaction , taking it when it happened but not giving that first thing back . \\n▁ he blew against my ni * * les , they hardened , peaking with a beautiful pain . \\n▁ his tongue swept along my skin , under the swells of my br * * sts , across my midriff , circling my belly button , lower , until it teased the edge of my black lace panties . \\n▁ then his mouth was on me between my legs , sucking for an instant , hot and hard , over my panties . \\n▁ the pleasure seared through me , rocking me to my soul and my h * ps surged upwards , an instinctive demand for more . \\n▁ his mouth disappeared and all of a sudden his body was on mine again , his lips against my mouth , the flavor of me a hint on his . \\n▁ ` ` you want my mouth between your legs ? '' \\n▁ he growled , even his voice , rough with desire , trilled through my system , making me squirm . \\n▁ i did . \\n▁ i wanted his mouth between my legs . \\n▁ i wanted him inside me , his tongue or anything else he choose to put there . \\n▁ i did n't answer , instead i panted against his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me ? '' \\n▁ he pushed . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' my voice was a breathy plea for release . \\n▁ ` ` beg me , '' he demanded . \\n▁ it would be so easy to give up , to give in , to take what i wanted knowing it would be , by far , the best i ever had . \\n▁ it would be so easy to humble myself and deal with the consequences later . \\n▁ but i could n't . \\n▁ if i did , i knew i 'd lose myself , all that was me . \\n▁ the mass of bad traits , stubbornness , impatience and sometimes fumbling idiocy and all the good traits too , my loyalty , sense of humor and compassion . \\n▁ i would n't hold onto me anymore . \\n▁ i would be giving it to him and i did n't trust him to take care of it . \\n▁ and i knew that even if he kept it safe , he would n't keep it long . \\n▁ he 'd release me as he did cecile and countless other concubines . \\n▁ by then , everything i was would be gone . \\n▁ he 'd retain it for centuries , likely uncaring he held such a precious gift but , for me , all would be lost . \\n▁ instead of explaining any of that , or giving him the demand he asked for , i gave him another kind of entreaty . \\n▁ ` ` do n't make me do that . '' \\n▁ his face grew hard . \\n▁ ` ` i have eternity , pet , to teach you this lesson . '' \\n▁ ` ` you wo n't last that long . \\n▁ you 'll give up , '' i told him , my body still burning for his touch , wriggling underneath him . \\n▁ at my words , he looked a mixture of amused and surprised . \\n▁ his head cocked to the side and he asked , ` ` do you think that 's true ? '' \\n▁ i nodded , being honest for once . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a vampire but you 're also a man . \\n▁ you 'll need to get it elsewhere and you will . \\n▁ eventually you 'll tire of me . '' \\n▁ he grinned and i did n't like it . \\n▁ it was his smug grin and i reckoned it foretold very bad things for me . \\n▁ i was n't wrong . \\n▁ ` ` oh , i wo n't tire of you , leah . \\n▁ but , you 're right . \\n▁ if you force me , i will indeed get it elsewhere . '' \\n▁ at the thought of him getting anything elsewhere , a different kind of heat slashed through me , washing away my desire in a wave of pain . \\n▁ this was unexpected , not only the reaction but the excruciating intensity of it . \\n▁ before the razor - sharp edge of this sensation could subside , his head snapped up . \\n▁ he drew in a deep breath through his nostrils and his eyes narrowed , focusing on something but not me , not something close . \\n▁ i sensed the danger instantly . \\n▁ our current situation forgotten , i whispered , ` ` lucien , something 's wrong . '' \\n▁ his eyes locked on mine . \\n▁ for some reason communicating xxunk , he replied straight into my brain , yes , pet . \\n▁ without further reply , his body knifed off mine and he moved away . \\n▁ he was holding himself tense , his powerful musculature standing out , more defined . \\n▁ the way he held his body was menacing , even sinister . \\n▁ i could sense he wanted to move with vampire speed but was forcing himself to go slowly . \\n▁ i heaved myself up and followed him , closing my robe , tying it tightly . \\n▁ the doorbell rang but he was already pulling the door open as the bell sounded . \\n▁ i stopped five feet away . \\n▁ a woman stood there . \\n▁ gleaming black hair , ice - blue eyes , her beauty so extraordinary , her sexuality so explicit , i could n't stop myself from sucking in a stunned breath at the sight of her . \\n▁ this was a mistake . \\n▁ when i gasped , her eyes , which were fastened on lucien , sliced to me . \\n▁ she , too , pulled in breath through her nostrils . \\n▁ in an instant , her face contorted with primal rage . \\n▁ in the next instant , she attacked . \\n▁ her target ? \\n▁ me . \\n▁ chapter ten the confrontations she flew at me and when i say that i mean it literally . \\n▁ she was a streak , a blur , my mortal eyes could n't make out the lines of her body . \\n▁ she did n't get close . \\n▁ three feet away from me , she came into definition . \\n▁ this was because she was halted , lucien 's arm around her waist . \\n▁ then lucien twisted , executing a near - blur , full on , powerful hurl that would have been awe - inspiring if it had n't been so freaking scary . \\n▁ she was a streak again , going backwards with tremendous velocity until she slammed against the wall . \\n▁ the plaster behind her buckled in a body - like shape , white dust and paint chips raining down around her as she fell to a graceful crouch , completely unharmed . \\n▁ her head snapped back , her seething eyes pinned on me . \\n▁ with only a moment 's delay , she sprang toward me again in another blurry attack . \\n▁ and again she was stopped , this time when she was , her whole body still swayed toward me . \\n▁ her whole body , that was , except her head and her neck . \\n▁ lucien had her by her throat . \\n▁ just one hand at her throat , the muscles in his arm and back bunching as he took two steps and slammed her against another wall , more plaster breaking , more debris falling . \\n▁ lucien got close to her and i saw his fingers squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` you just made a fatal mistake , katrina , '' he gritted from between clenched teeth . \\n▁ his fury matched hers , maybe surpassed it . \\n▁ i knew this because his jaw was working so hard a muscle leapt there . \\n▁ i stood frozen not only from what i just witnessed but that i was just almost attacked by what amounted to lucien 's wife . \\n▁ his wife ! \\n▁ and she was stunning . \\n▁ she was the most beautiful creature i 'd ever seen . \\n▁ i had to admit that even if she wanted to tear me limb from limb . \\n▁ her incensed gaze slid from me to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve f * * ked her . \\n▁ i can smell it . '' \\n▁ her voice was deep , throaty , seductive . \\n▁ it was n't throaty because her husband held her by the throat but just because it was . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't f * * ked her , '' lucien replied truthfully and i thanked god at that moment that it was , indeed , the truth . \\n▁ then , presenting more evidence he was the demented sort of vampire , lucien finished with , ` ` yet . '' \\n▁ her fisted hands slammed into the walls at her sides breaking clean through the drywall before her body started thrashing wildly to gain release . \\n▁ in a delayed effort of self - preservation , i took several hasty steps back . \\n▁ settle , pet . \\n▁ i 'll not let her hurt you . \\n▁ you 're safe . \\n▁ lucien 's voice sounded in my head and it was just his voice , not a command , my body was at my will . \\n▁ even so , i stopped moving . \\n▁ suddenly , katrina tensed from the top of her head to her toes . \\n▁ she tilted her head back and let out a wild screech that hurt my ears and it felt like it even shook the windows . \\n▁ after she was done , her eyes sliced to me . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to kill her , '' she screamed . \\n▁ my body grew tense but i stayed still . \\n▁ lucien 's voice was a snarl . \\n▁ ` ` you touch her , f * * k , rina , after this you even look at her , you 'll f * * king burn . '' \\n▁ her gaze moved to lucien and she changed her threat . \\n▁ ` ` then i ' m going to kill you . '' \\n▁ instantly , to my shock and despair , he dropped her and stepped back . \\n▁ his hands went out to his sides and he issued a one word invitation . \\n▁ ` ` try . '' \\n▁ a roar of fury tore from her throat and she lunged . \\n▁ that was pretty much all i saw with any clarity . \\n▁ they were too fast , too powerful , all their movement was a blur . \\n▁ every once in a while lucien would pin her and they 'd come into focus but she 'd escape and their movements would become indistinct . \\n▁ the table in the hall was turned over , the vase on it shattering into pieces , those pieces kicked wildly about as they moved . \\n▁ i took two more steps back , these up the stairs when i heard lucien again in my brain , still , pet . \\n▁ i stilled . \\n▁ i did n't want to . \\n▁ i did n't even know why i did . \\n▁ i just did . \\n▁ even though i did n't see it i knew it was brutal , savage even . \\n▁ the noises they made , her grunts of pain and effort , lucien 's grunts solely of effort , the sounds of fists against flesh , the noise of bodies colliding , all of this slashed through the air . \\n▁ i had felt a great deal of fear in the last few weeks but i 'd never been so terrified in all my life than i was at that moment . \\n▁ this was because i was witnessing something extraordinarily vicious . \\n▁ this was also because i was witnessing , no matter how indistinct , lucien beating the shit out of his wife . \\n▁ if he ever got physical with me in that way he 'd kill me in seconds . \\n▁ my body started trembling and i wanted to run , i really did , but my fear rooted me to the spot . \\n▁ finally , katrina came into focus , her body slamming against the door making its heavy , solidness shake . \\n▁ she stopped , as did lucien facing her but slightly turned to the side . \\n▁ i could see bloody , angry scratch marks marring his chest and neck . \\n▁ she was far worse for the wear , her nose bleeding profusely , her lip cut , angry red marks at her neck and wrists . \\n▁ at the sight of what lucien had done to her , a violent tremor shook through my body nearly bringing me to my knees . \\n▁ ` ` i got the severance papers this morning , '' she spat at him as she wiped the back of her hand under her nose , smearing the blood across her face . \\n▁ her words confused me . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't say ? '' \\n▁ he retorted carelessly . \\n▁ her face twisted with rage . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd throw me away for a mortal ? '' \\n▁ my astonished , frightened eyes moved to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` look at her , rina , she 's no mere mortal , '' lucien clipped . \\n▁ katrina did n't look at me , instead she snapped , ` ` yes , i forgot . \\n▁ she 's life . '' \\n▁ what did that mean ? \\n▁ any of it ! \\n▁ lucien took an ominous step closer to her and i watched her quail , her bravado slipping , she 'd learned her lesson far faster than any he 'd ever taught me . \\n▁ ` ` i lost you the minute you laid eyes on her , '' she accused , her voice turning small . \\n▁ ` ` you lost me two seconds after the claiming and you know it , '' he returned sharply . \\n▁ she flinched because clearly , whatever the hell that meant , she did know it . \\n▁ i flinched for her . \\n▁ it was hard not to feel sorry for her . \\n▁ she was n't pathetic , she was just broken . \\n▁ her gaze shifted to me and it narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` are you enjoying this ? '' \\n▁ she asked , her voice dripping with sarcasm . \\n▁ it was safe to say i was not . \\n▁ i was saved from having to reply when lucien gritted out , ` ` look at me , rina , do n't look at leah . \\n▁ she no longer exists for you . '' \\n▁ when she did n't obey immediately , he thundered , ` ` fucking look at me ! '' \\n▁ she did , so did i , anyone would . \\n▁ ` ` keep her safe , lucien , '' she whispered , her tone disturbing , so disturbing it sent a chill straight through me . \\n▁ ` ` you touch her , you 'll burn . '' \\n▁ lucien 's voice was just as disturbing , more so . \\n▁ i did n't know katrina , her threat could be empty . \\n▁ i knew lucien , his threat was not . \\n▁ ` ` yes , but you do n't get it lucien . \\n▁ i 'll be happy to burn because while i burn i 'll know you 'll be facing eternity without your precious life . '' \\n▁ lucien 's body tensed the way it had done earlier , his muscles coming into sharp relief , menacing , sinister . \\n▁ i held my breath . \\n▁ then i heard the backdoor open . \\n▁ ` ` yoo hoo ! '' \\n▁ edwina called . \\n▁ ` ` there 's a car in the drive ! \\n▁ do we have … oh ! '' \\n▁ edwina stopped speaking . \\n▁ the backdoor had a direct shot to the front door down a wide hall off of which four rooms led . \\n▁ edwina could n't see me but she could likely see lucien and katrina . \\n▁ and you did n't have to have extra sensory perception to feel the crackling animosity in the air not to mention katrina 's face was a bloody mess . \\n▁ ` ` you backed a losing horse , edwina , '' katrina called apropos of absolutely nothing . \\n▁ ` ` everyone knows about leah . \\n▁ he kissed her at the bar at a f * * king feast for all the world to f * * king see . '' \\n▁ this too confused me and i heard edwina 's shocked gasp from not too far away so i knew it surprised her which confused me all the more . \\n▁ ` ` the council will investigate , '' katrina went on and i saw edwina come into my vision at the side of the stairs . \\n▁ her face was pale . \\n▁ ` ` investigate ? '' \\n▁ edwina asked the question on the tip of my tongue . \\n▁ ` ` you know they will , '' katrina stated , her eyes sliding to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll make sure of it . '' \\n▁ lucien was standing with his arms crossed on his chest like he was watching a vaguely annoying street performer who had roped him into his routine . \\n▁ ` ` another threat , '' he drawled derisively . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll call them from your f * * king driveway . \\n▁ you 're kissing her at feasts . \\n▁ you ' ve moved in with her . \\n▁ you intend to - '' katrina retorted and lucien cut her off . \\n▁ ` ` be my guest , '' he invited and katrina 's eyes went wide then they swung to me . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve lost your mind , '' she breathed toward me even though she was talking to lucien . \\n▁ her gaze moving back , she studied him a moment and all of a sudden her lip curled . \\n▁ ` ` though i should n't be surprised , you ' ve always had a taste for sweet smelling pu * * y. '' i gasped . \\n▁ edwina gasped . \\n▁ lucien moved . \\n▁ he crowded her back into the door , his powerful frame cutting her off from view . \\n▁ i looked nervously at edwina . \\n▁ edwina looked nervously at me . \\n▁ then she gave me a shaky smile which i did not return and we both looked back at the scene . \\n▁ ` ` the council will grant me this . '' \\n▁ lucien was saying . \\n▁ ` ` never , '' katrina returned . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m calling in my marker , '' lucien announced . \\n▁ i heard katrina 's sharp intake of breath . \\n▁ i looked to edwina who was staring fixedly at lucien 's back , her face the picture of shock and i knew at least she knew what this meant . \\n▁ i had no idea what was going on . \\n▁ none of it . \\n▁ ` ` they 'll still not allow it . '' \\n▁ katrina did n't sound so sure now . \\n▁ ` ` they owe me , '' lucien retorted . \\n▁ ` ` they do but a mortal ? '' \\n▁ katrina shot back . \\n▁ ` ` they wo n't even consider it . \\n▁ not even for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` they ' ve no choice , '' lucien stated . \\n▁ there was a hesitation then softly , with some kind of weird understanding in her voice , katrina said , ` ` i ' ve heard of this but did n't expect it of you . \\n▁ her scent has driven you insane . '' \\n▁ lucien did n't hesitate with his reply . \\n▁ ` ` if that 's the case , i ' m happy in my insanity . '' \\n▁ that was the third weirdest , yet most profound , compliment i had that day even though i had no idea what was going on . \\n▁ i also had the distinct feeling i wanted no more compliments from the mighty vampire lucien who 'd beat the crap out of his wife in his concubine 's foyer while insisting said concubine watch . \\n▁ ` ` you want war , '' katrina whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i want my life back , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` if to get it that means war then i want war . '' \\n▁ um … war ? \\n▁ ` ` i 'll not fight on your side , '' she informed him , the bravado back in her voice , her words a challenge . \\n▁ ` ` i never expected you would , '' lucien returned . \\n▁ i could n't see all of her but i saw parts of her body twitch as if she 'd been struck . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't think much of me , do you ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't for the last thirty years , '' he replied with frank cruelty . \\n▁ she stepped out from in front of him and i could see her now . \\n▁ her eyes looked to me then back to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m beginning to feel sorry for her , '' katrina commented . \\n▁ ` ` you should n't . \\n▁ she 's everything you 're not , '' lucien responded . \\n▁ that hurt . \\n▁ i could see it in her flinch and i felt her pain . \\n▁ any woman would . \\n▁ he was harsh and he was heartless and , honest to goodness , i never thought i could hate him anymore but i did at that moment . \\n▁ it was lunacy , his wife had tried to do me bodily harm but i felt for her , i could n't help it . \\n▁ ` ` what did i do to make you hate me so much ? '' \\n▁ she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` you , like all of them , tried to cage me . \\n▁ i ca n't abide that , rina , you knew it . \\n▁ you knew how i felt about it and you did it all the same . '' \\n▁ ` ` i loved you . '' \\n▁ she was still whispering . \\n▁ even at her soft words , lucien remained remote . \\n▁ ` ` love is a blanket that keeps you warm not one that traps and suffocates you . \\n▁ you never learned that lesson , rina . \\n▁ you never paid it any attention no matter how many times i explained . \\n▁ you kept pulling that blanket over my head . '' \\n▁ silently she assumed the posture of defeat and it was so heartbreaking , my eyes swung to lucien , thinking he 'd relent . \\n▁ he did n't . \\n▁ in fact , as he took her in , his lip curled in a contemptuous sneer . \\n▁ my heart started beating faster . \\n▁ i did n't know why , hatred , fear for my future life as this man was going to factor largely in it or both . \\n▁ he heard my heart . \\n▁ i knew this because his eyes cut to me , his face lost its disdain and his brows drew together in puzzlement . \\n▁ ` ` edwina , '' katrina said in a soft farewell and i tore my gaze from lucien but before i could focus or edwina could respond , katrina was gone . \\n▁ ` ` see to the groceries , '' lucien ordered edwina . \\n▁ i looked back to him to see him striding with purpose toward me . \\n▁ i started backing up the steps . \\n▁ ` ` clean up this mess , '' lucien continued his instructions , his gait wide and determined and i started backing up double time . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't need to say good - bye when you leave , '' lucien finished his commands to edwina . \\n▁ at those ominous words , i turned on the landing and ran . \\n▁ in a second i was cradled in his arms and in the next we were in the bedroom and i was bouncing on the bed . \\n▁ lucien was looming over me , fists to his hips , eyes dark and glittering . \\n▁ ` ` you run from me ? '' \\n▁ his voice was dangerous . \\n▁ i felt my fear escalate at a slightly lower rate than my temper flared . \\n▁ ` ` down there , i trusted you . '' \\n▁ those five words were an accusation . \\n▁ his head cocked to the side . \\n▁ ` ` and how , exactly , did i betray that trust , pet ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you told me to stay , '' i informed him . \\n▁ ` ` yes ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i stayed . '' \\n▁ ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't possibly need me to explain ! '' \\n▁ i snapped . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m afraid i do , '' he clipped back . \\n▁ i got to my knees , hands balled into fists at my sides and i leaned toward him . \\n▁ ` ` you just beat your wife in front of me ! '' \\n▁ i shouted . \\n▁ ` ` it was n't the first time but , fortunately , it was the last , '' he replied indifferently . \\n▁ i drew in a sharp breath , reared back in horror and fell to my bottom . \\n▁ ` ` you disgust me , '' i hissed , meaning every word . \\n▁ his body did that thing again , that menacing , sinister change where his muscles came into sharp relief . \\n▁ ` ` i disgust you ? '' \\n▁ he whispered . \\n▁ i ignored his stance even though he had to know my fear . \\n▁ my heart was beating so wildly i could , indeed , this time actually hear it . \\n▁ if i could , he certainly could . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i retorted with more bravery than sense . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have any f * * king idea what you just witnessed . '' \\n▁ his voice was still a low , outraged whisper . \\n▁ ` ` i do and it was nauseating . '' \\n▁ all of a sudden his rage filled the room , clogging my throat , expanding my lungs and he was leaning over me , his fists in the bed beside my hips . \\n▁ i scrambled backwards up the bed . \\n▁ he followed , faster , crawling along with my body . \\n▁ my head hit the headboard and he retreated , only far enough to rise up , using my legs to yank me back down the bed between his thighs and then he settled his heavy weight on me . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve demonstrated another appalling trait , pet . '' \\n▁ he was still using his scary whisper . \\n▁ ` ` and what 's this one ? '' \\n▁ i shot back . \\n▁ ` ` i thought you 'd seen them all . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're quick to judge , not even asking that first , f * * king question , '' he retorted . \\n▁ ` ` and how could you explain bloodying your wife 's nose in front of your supposed to be lover ? \\n▁ hunh ? \\n▁ how about humiliating her in the same company ? \\n▁ how about wanting a lover at all when you have a wife . '' \\n▁ i made a snorting noise that was slightly embarrassing but i was too furious to care . \\n▁ ` ` i should n't be surprised . \\n▁ you ' ve forced me to humble myself more than once . \\n▁ why i trusted you and did n't run so i was n't forced to witness that i. . . \\n▁ will … never … know . '' \\n▁ his body went solid and his eyes bored into mine . \\n▁ this lasted what felt like an eternity . \\n▁ then he pulled in a breath sharply through his nose . \\n▁ when he was done , i sensed the patience he was seeking eluded him . \\n▁ i was n't wrong . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve risked everything for you , '' he told me quietly . \\n▁ ` ` your marriage ? '' \\n▁ my voice was dripping acid . \\n▁ ` ` it did n't seem you prized that overly much . '' \\n▁ it was like i did n't even speak . \\n▁ ` ` everything , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` and what do i get in return ? '' \\n▁ it was beginning to dawn on me that i was in a very bad situation . \\n▁ firstly , lucien could and did in a fury beat the crap out of his wife . \\n▁ secondly , if he did that to me , i would n't survive . \\n▁ thirdly , for whatever reason , he was angry , no , he was infuriated . \\n▁ beyond anything i 'd ever experienced from anyone before in my life . \\n▁ and lastly , i could n't fight him . \\n▁ i had absolutely no way to defend myself against anything he chose to inflict on me . \\n▁ all the tissues in my body petrified as fear paralyzed me . \\n▁ ` ` that 's the smartest response you ' ve had today , '' lucien informed me and i knew i was in trouble . \\n▁ he grinned and it was not one of his handsome grins . \\n▁ this was a grin i 'd never seen before . \\n▁ it was ruthless . \\n▁ his grin disappeared because his face disappeared in my neck . \\n▁ ` ` listen to me now , leah . \\n▁ i will break you . \\n▁ do you understand me ? '' \\n▁ he vowed , his voice rumbling against my skin . \\n▁ i did n't but at the same time i did . \\n▁ he continued , ` ` and , right now , i ' m taking a taste of what i ' m risking everything for . '' \\n▁ his head came up and his face came close , so close , i could feel his breath against my lips . \\n▁ ` ` but do n't worry , pet , you do n't have to beg for it . '' \\n▁ oh no . \\n▁ my body burst into a flurry of frenzied motion , a futile effort at escape . \\n▁ i knew this would have no effect and it did n't . \\n▁ my robe was gone in nary a second . \\n▁ my panties whisked down my legs in a blur of his arm . \\n▁ he spread my legs with his large hands and i opened my mouth to scream . \\n▁ the scream died in my throat as his mouth touched me . \\n▁ the sudden shock of his mouth moving on me killed my scream . \\n▁ his obvious talent subdued my struggles . \\n▁ he 'd lived a long time and in that time he 'd obviously learned exactly what to do between a woman 's legs . \\n▁ in fact , it was pretty clear he made an art of it . \\n▁ in an instinctive reaction to the pleasure rippling through my system , my h * ps rose to meet his mouth . \\n▁ he was not gentle . \\n▁ he was voracious . \\n▁ lips , tongue , suction , he used it all . \\n▁ my fingers curled into the covers as my neck arched and moans of sheer pleasure purred from my throat . \\n▁ his hands went up the back of my thighs to my knees and pushed them high , until they were at my sides . \\n▁ this gave him better access which he utilized to his definite advantage . \\n▁ i was close , so close , right there and it was going to be beyond anything i 'd ever experienced . \\n▁ beyond anything any woman had ever experienced -lrb- unless she 'd been with lucien , obviously -rrb- . \\n▁ my hands went from the comforter to his head , holding him to me as i prepared to topple over the edge . \\n▁ his mouth disappeared and i was yanked right back . \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ i cried as his big body settled on me and his strong hand cupped me between my legs , keeping me warm but exerting no pressure which was a cruel tease . \\n▁ ` ` now , you beg , leah , '' he said against my mouth . \\n▁ with effort , my eyes focused on him and i screamed , ` ` i hate you ! '' \\n▁ he disappeared but only for a moment then his mouth was back at me . \\n▁ the advantage i 'd gained over my body 's reaction was lost in seconds . \\n▁ this time he teased as i fought my rising desire . \\n▁ when i lost , he made me go after it . \\n▁ he gave me enough to keep me squirming . \\n▁ and when my fingers clutched his hair in defeat , he gave me all of it again . \\n▁ then , right at the golden moment , he was up over me and covering me again . \\n▁ ` ` beg , '' he demanded . \\n▁ it took everything i had but i focused on him . \\n▁ ` ` go to hell ! '' \\n▁ he rolled to his back taking me with him , pulling me up over his body , spreading my legs , he settled me in a crouch on his mouth . \\n▁ hands strong on my hips , he pulled me down and kept at me . \\n▁ it was delicious . \\n▁ it was divine . \\n▁ it was ecstasy . \\n▁ i grabbed the headboard and moaned deep in the back of my throat , no longer conscious of the sounds i was making . \\n▁ i rocked my h * ps against my mouth . \\n▁ he pulled down on them , going deeper , using his tongue in new and astounding ways . \\n▁ he took me there again , to that glorious place and right before i felt it coming , he pulled me away from his mouth and yanked me down his body . \\n▁ ` ` beg me for it , leah . '' \\n▁ his voice was husky and near to a plea all on its own . \\n▁ he had an arm tight around my waist , fastening my squirming body to his . \\n▁ his other hand was working between our bodies but i was too much in a state to notice what he was doing . \\n▁ every centimeter of my skin was sensitized beyond being bearable . \\n▁ i could even feel the air around us causing agonizing pleasure . \\n▁ his hands went to the backs of my knees and jerked them up . \\n▁ i was straddling him and for one beautiful moment i felt the hard , hot tip of him enter me . \\n▁ in triumph , i ground my h * ps down but he was faster than me . \\n▁ he caught me at my waist before i gained half an inch . \\n▁ my head snapped up and my eyes flew to his . \\n▁ ` ` you want my c * * k inside you ? '' \\n▁ he asked , his voice hoarse . \\n▁ i did . \\n▁ i wanted it more than oxygen . \\n▁ i remained silent . \\n▁ he inched up what felt like a millimeter and i felt my lids slowly close in rapture . \\n▁ then he stopped and my eyes shot open . \\n▁ ` ` beg me , pet , '' he whispered , his voice now tortured . \\n▁ i had no voice so i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` beg me , '' he ordered harshly . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i breathed . \\n▁ ` ` you want me , '' he stated . \\n▁ i stared at him then i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` then beg me . '' \\n▁ finding a strength inside me that i did n't even know was there , i pulled up against his hands , my body straining against my brain 's demands and i could n't believe it , he let me . \\n▁ i felt the small but hard and thick and unbelievably magnificent piece of him that i had slide out of me . \\n▁ it felt like i 'd lost a piece of me , not him , when i pulled free . \\n▁ regardless , stubborn to the last -lrb- and now hating myself for it -rrb- , my eyes locked on his and i declared , ` ` you wo n't break me . '' \\n▁ his arms wrapped around me , crushing me to him , i was hoping in defeat so he 'd give me what my body was aching for . \\n▁ instead , he rolled us to our sides , his arms still holding me close and into the top of my hair , he said , ` ` you ' ve forced my hand , leah . '' \\n▁ fear pierced through me because , without any attempt to hide it , his voice was filled with regret and i did n't know why . \\n▁ what was worse , even though i did n't know what he regretted , i had a feeling whatever it was , was something i 'd regret more . \\n▁ he kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m leaving and when i return , if i find you ' ve touched yourself , you 'll have a week of what you just had and you can beg me until you 're hoarse to make me let you come but i wo n't do it . \\n▁ am i understood ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're understood , '' i mumbled into his chest where he 'd pressed my face . \\n▁ he tensed as if to move and i did n't want him to go . \\n▁ not because i forgot he disgusted and terrified me and i detested him , i only could forget those when his mouth was between my legs and other times besides , but because any movement made my body feel like it was going to shatter . \\n▁ i felt his body relax right before he sighed . \\n▁ then he asked , ` ` why do you fight me , sweetheart ? '' \\n▁ i did n't answer . \\n▁ to answer was to trust him with a piece of me and after all that he 'd done to me and what he 'd done to his f * * king wife , i knew he was not someone i could trust . \\n▁ ever . \\n▁ no matter how gentle he could seem . \\n▁ like right now . \\n▁ or when he called me sweetheart . \\n▁ or when he laughed like i was the funniest person he 'd ever met in his centuries upon centuries of life . \\n▁ he went on , ` ` you must know it will be good . '' \\n▁ oh , i knew that . \\n▁ i still did n't answer . \\n▁ he sighed again before he murmured , ` ` you do n't understand . '' \\n▁ no . \\n▁ i . \\n▁ did . \\n▁ not . \\n▁ and i did n't want to . \\n▁ i still did n't speak . \\n▁ ` ` my pet , it 'll be so much better when you submit to me . \\n▁ that , i can promise . \\n▁ not just here , in bed , but all of it , everything that will be you and me . \\n▁ i promise you , leah , i ' m trying to give you something beautiful . \\n▁ i ca n't explain it , you have to feel it . \\n▁ but to feel it , you must trust me . '' \\n▁ fat chance of that . \\n▁ i still did n't speak . \\n▁ for a while , he did n't either . \\n▁ then , as if he was n't talking to me -lrb- which he was n't -rrb- , he muttered , ` ` i ' m the one who wanted a challenge . \\n▁ i need to get my f * * king head examined . '' \\n▁ i did n't understand that either . \\n▁ there was a lot that i did n't understand . \\n▁ but i did n't ask . \\n▁ and i was never going to . \\n▁ never , never , never . \\n▁ gently he pulled away from me . \\n▁ the loss of his hard warmth meant the cold hit my sensitive nudity like a slap . \\n▁ he adjusted his jeans and had me beneath the sheet in a blur of motion , faster than he 'd been before even when he was being speedy vamp . \\n▁ obviously , he 'd been holding out on me . \\n▁ he pulled my hair away from my shoulder and i shoved my face in the pillow to escape his action even though i allowed his touch . \\n▁ ` ` stubborn , '' he murmured but i could swear there was pride mixed with the frustration in his voice . \\n▁ and i did n't understand that either . \\n▁ then he was gone but within five minutes he was back , this time dressed in a suit . \\n▁ he sat on the edge of the bed and i glared up at him as he gazed down at me . \\n▁ ` ` it 's been a long time that , on some level , i did n't look forward to attending a feast , '' he informed me and my body grew rock solid . \\n▁ he was going to a feast . \\n▁ unbidden , unwanted but undeniable anguish scorched through me , hot and biting . \\n▁ he bent forward , brushing my cheek with his lips . \\n▁ ` ` have a good day , pet , and sleep well . '' \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ he was n't even coming home . \\n▁ even though my mind screamed , my mouth nor body moved . \\n▁ he did . \\n▁ in an instant , he was gone . \\n▁ i hate you , my brain whispered . \\n▁ i heard you , sweetheart , he whispered back . \\n▁ his endearment burned into me like a brand . \\n▁ i know , i told him . \\n▁ stubborn , he told me . \\n▁ i turned off my mind , turned my face in my pillow and put every effort into making absolutely certain i did n't cry . \\n▁ after a long struggle , at last , i finally succeeded at something . \\n▁ it was an empty victory . \\n▁ chapter eleven the betrayal lucien 's eyes scanned the heaving dance floor and he saw her . \\n▁ although he did n't often attend this particular feast , he 'd seen her before . \\n▁ each time she 'd enticed him , long , dark blonde hair , blue eyes , curvy body , alluring scent . \\n▁ tonight , she did especially as she was wearing a black dress almost like the one leah had worn last night . \\n▁ not the same quality but close enough . \\n▁ everything about her was not the same quality but close enough . \\n▁ he knew she captured his attention because she reminded him of leah . \\n▁ it had been the reason he 'd never taken her . \\n▁ he was anticipating the real thing , not an oft - used imitation . \\n▁ but tonight , she 'd do . \\n▁ her eyes caught his and she smiled xxunk , an open and eager invitation . \\n▁ it was clear she was his to do with as he wished and this feast , as he wished , had very few boundaries . \\n▁ he looked away , allowing his aversion to show . \\n▁ eager and willing were not what he wanted . \\n▁ spirit , personality , passion , defiance , fear , challenge , those were what he wanted . \\n▁ after centuries he finally had all of that , a great deal of it . \\n▁ it was just that he was finding it maddening to an extreme . \\n▁ and excruciatingly frustrating . \\n▁ lucien attended feasts often , even if he particularly liked the taste of his concubine and , it went without saying , he particularly liked the taste of leah . \\n▁ he was a vampire with a healthy appetite and feasts allowed him diversity in that appetite . \\n▁ however , over the last several centuries , he 'd grown weary of them . \\n▁ all the mortals who attended feasts were registered with the council . \\n▁ they were safe , healthy , willing , well - bred , from well - to - do families and their time was limited . \\n▁ they had two years to attend feasts , any feast they wanted , as many as they could attend before they were retired . \\n▁ fallen concubines were a different story . \\n▁ they came to feasts and , out of respect for their legacy families , they were reluctantly allowed to attend but they were n't registered . \\n▁ however the council tracked them and after a few years the fallen concubines were eventually banned . \\n▁ there were times when vampires had a taste at a feast that they exceptionally enjoyed , one they did n't wish to share . \\n▁ if this was the case , they could petition the council . \\n▁ if the council found the mortal suitable , the family would be approached for recruitment . \\n▁ if accepted , that mortal could become the vampire 's concubine . \\n▁ but also that new concubine 's line would forever be in the life . \\n▁ the mortal never refused . \\n▁ every mortal there hoped to be claimed into the life , ensuring their own continued feeding and their line 's future . \\n▁ it rarely happened that a vampire made this petition but it was encouraged by the council . \\n▁ more choice at selections meant happier vampires . \\n▁ the concubine lines detested it when this happened , more choice meant less opportunity for their own line to be chosen . \\n▁ surveying the crush of bodies in the room , lucien could n't imagine petitioning for such a mortal . \\n▁ although he enjoyed feasts on a variety of levels , most especially being with his brethren in a place where they could be who they were without hiding , without secrets , he did n't enjoy the mortals they drew . \\n▁ they were , for all practical purposes , whores without any money changing hands . \\n▁ he fed from them , naturally , but he 'd never chosen from a line recruited from a feast . \\n▁ the very idea of entering an arrangement with such a mortal was repugnant to lucien . \\n▁ this attitude , stephanie told him , was alarmingly superior but he did n't give a f * * k. to take his mind off the woman on the dance floor and his thoughts , he started to sip his martini and noticed the glass was drained . \\n▁ he turned away from his position facing the room to the bar , caught the bartender 's attention and jerked up his chin . \\n▁ the bartender acknowledged his order and started to work on another martini , leaving the drinks he was preparing sitting on the counter unfinished . \\n▁ lucien looked at the three women whose drinks had gone wanting . \\n▁ mortals . \\n▁ all looking at him . \\n▁ all smiling at him . \\n▁ all smiling the same smile the blonde had tossed him . \\n▁ his eyes raked over them in revulsion and their smiles wavered , one went pale and turned away . \\n▁ lucien did as well . \\n▁ and his thoughts went instantly to leah . \\n▁ it had been difficult to shut her from his mind but he had succeeded in doing so the last ten hours , mainly with work . \\n▁ there were many vampires who amassed their fortunes and happily lived their eternities managing them and living off the interest . \\n▁ lucien was not such a vampire . \\n▁ unlike everything else in his life , his business never ceased to be a challenge . \\n▁ there was always a new mountain to be tried , tested and conquered . \\n▁ new inventions , new technologies , new strategies and more and more money to earn . \\n▁ if it had n't been for that , he would have gone mad ages ago . \\n▁ the bartender served his martini . \\n▁ lucien paid for it , turning back unseeing to the room and allowing his thoughts to travel to leah . \\n▁ his fury had cooled considerably since their confrontation . \\n▁ although , the thought of her declaration of him ` ` disgusting '' her still made him clench his teeth . \\n▁ however lucien had to admit that she did n't know male and female vampires were vastly different from her kind . \\n▁ females were just as strong and skilled as males , many more so . \\n▁ for instance , stephanie , who was known to be a fierce and cunning fighter . \\n▁ he further had to admit there was no way for leah to know the way of vampire mates . \\n▁ this would not even have been covered in vampire studies had she managed not to be expelled . \\n▁ she had no way of knowing that , because of the matched strength and the way of their culture , vampires , especially mates , did not settle arguments by having heartfelt chats or seeking counseling . \\n▁ they challenged then they battled physically with no rules and no holds barred . \\n▁ this had the benefit of settling the order of vampires , who was strongest , quickest , sharpest and smartest . \\n▁ in the case of mates , this had the additional benefit that , more often than not , physical duels led to something vastly more pleasurable . \\n▁ he also had to admit that there was no way of leah knowing his history with katrina . \\n▁ her frequent and misguided jealous rages . \\n▁ her phone calls , sometimes a dozen a day . \\n▁ to check in , she said . \\n▁ to check up , she meant . \\n▁ her constant suspicion , rifling through his things , listening into phone calls . \\n▁ and then there were the times , infrequent though they were , they happened far too often for lucien 's liking , when she would appear at a feast that lucien was attending . \\n▁ she 'd done this twice . \\n▁ then he 'd had to break her of this habit which he 'd done by more than bloodying her nose . \\n▁ he 'd also broken her femur and five ribs , all of which healed within an hour and , obviously , it had not led to something more pleasurable . \\n▁ this happened after she 'd entered his private chamber and appeared at his side when he was actually feeding . \\n▁ suggesting , during those times , with false sensuality , that they share the mortal morsel . \\n▁ that such an activity would bring them closer together . \\n▁ katrina knew he did n't like to share . \\n▁ during these two times , she had also infiltrated his privacy , something he required even at a feast . \\n▁ he meant it when he told leah he ` ` danced '' privately . \\n▁ he did n't simply not share the mortal on whom he was feeding , he did n't share the experience . \\n▁ therefore he always took a private room , leaving the group feeding to others . \\n▁ he disliked the idea of other mortals , or vampires for that matter , getting off on watching him with his meal . \\n▁ and they would , he 'd be the center of attention . \\n▁ he always was . \\n▁ it was n't that he thought it was a private activity . \\n▁ he too enjoyed watching others feed . \\n▁ he also meant it when he told leah he thought it was beautiful . \\n▁ it was just his nature . \\n▁ even if for only one feeding , that mortal was his and his alone and , in any way the word could be defined , he did n't share . \\n▁ and lastly , leah did n't know what he was risking for her . \\n▁ to have her in every way meant he was challenging his culture , his people 's way of life and hers and putting his own life at risk . \\n▁ even though he had to admit all those things , the simple fact of the matter was , she had n't asked . \\n▁ not a single question . \\n▁ she instantly thought the worst of him , judging him through the acceptable behaviors of her own culture , never considering there might be a difference in his . \\n▁ not only that , he had saved her from katrina 's attack , which would have been deadly . \\n▁ he had also , very blatantly , shown his preference for leah over his own mate . \\n▁ this was not something she could know was completely unheard of in the vampire realm but any woman of his experience would have had a vastly different reaction to leah 's . \\n▁ not to mention , with all of this , in addition to his clothes in her closet , his body in her bed , the rather luxurious roof over her head and opulent wardrobe he had provided her , he had made it abundantly clear she had his continued protection , his undivided attention and his profuse generosity . \\n▁ none of which , considering her reaction , seemed to penetrate that obstinate f * * king brain of hers . \\n▁ it was high time , lucien decided , that leah learn these important lessons . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't expect to see you here , '' cosmo said , appearing at his side , smiling at lucien and taking him from his thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` i could say the same , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't normally your scene . '' \\n▁ cosmo murmured , ` ` vodka , rocks , '' to the bartender and turned his attention back to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't yours either . '' \\n▁ then he looked around while asking , ` ` where 's leah ? \\n▁ is she in the restroom ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she 's home , '' lucien answered and cosmo 's head swung to him . \\n▁ ` ` home ? '' \\n▁ he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` home , '' lucien stated firmly . \\n▁ ` ` she 's having some difficulty adjusting to her new life . \\n▁ i ' m giving her space to sort herself out . '' \\n▁ cosmo threw his head back and burst out laughing . \\n▁ lucien watched his friend thinking that not the first damn thing was funny . \\n▁ cosmo 's laughter became chuckling as he paid for his drink and took a sip . \\n▁ ` ` you 're losing your touch , my friend , '' cosmo noted , his eyes scanning the crowd also unseeing , his attention was on the conversation . \\n▁ ` ` it 's been a whole week . \\n▁ back in the day , within a week , you 'd have them gagging for it . '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps , considering it 's been centuries , i ' m out of practice . '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps ? '' \\n▁ cosmo was still smiling broadly . \\n▁ ` ` or perhaps you ' ve met your match . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 'll break , '' lucien said low , meaning every word and taking a sip from his drink . \\n▁ and she would . \\n▁ after he 'd heard her weeping and later discovering the shredded lingerie , he had thought she already had , albeit briefly . \\n▁ having it confirmed that day that only her game plan had changed had not only been invigorating , it had been a relief . \\n▁ indeed , the sense of relief was so strong it was vaguely alarming . \\n▁ it was as if he did n't want her to break . \\n▁ as if he did n't want the taming . \\n▁ as if he did n't want her to submit to his control , instantly acquiesce to his demands , all of which would be for her own good or her pleasure , even though she did n't understand this . \\n▁ as if he did n't want to show her that her life , entrusted in his care , would blossom beyond her imagining . \\n▁ it was as if he wanted things to remain as they were ; the constant battles , contests of will and bickering interspersed with her quirky sweetness and immense humor . \\n▁ which was absurd . \\n▁ ` ` well , how long do you think it 'll take ? '' \\n▁ cosmo asked . \\n▁ ` ` maybe stephanie and i can place bets . \\n▁ it would be amusing . '' \\n▁ lucien leaned back against the bar and did n't answer . \\n▁ cosmo was undeterred . \\n▁ ` ` it took you three weeks with maggie . \\n▁ do you think leah will break maggie 's record ? '' \\n▁ ` ` at the rate she 's going , '' lucien drawled , ` ` it 'll be the next century before either you or stephanie see a return on your bet . '' \\n▁ cosmo again burst out laughing but lucien 's mind turned to something about their conversation that was unsettling . \\n▁ cosmo had mentioned maggie and for the first time in hundreds of years , the mention of her name had not felt like a knife twisted in his gut . \\n▁ he scanned his memories , all of which , over eight hundred years of them , stayed sharp in his mind . \\n▁ he remembered maggie 's taming . \\n▁ it had been the sweetest moment in his life , both up until that point and since . \\n▁ the submission , the gift of her trust , the laying of her life in his hands for his safekeeping . \\n▁ he 'd rewarded her and she 'd flourished immediately . \\n▁ he could still feel her underneath him , her legs opening of their own accord , her welcoming of his body in hers , the taste of her blood in his mouth , the scent of her filling his nostrils . \\n▁ he could also see her smile , hear her laughter , taste her skin and feel her warm body pressed against him in sleep . \\n▁ every second with maggie was burned on his brain , none of it was forgotten nor was it any less sweet . \\n▁ it was just that the familiar pain of the memory which fused with the memory of her loss had vanished . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ cosmo called and lucien focused on his friend . \\n▁ ` ` maggie , '' cosmo murmured , his face grew concerned and he continued in a soft voice , ` ` sorry , that 's twice i ' ve - '' ` ` do n't worry about it , '' lucien cut him off , not about to share his revelation . \\n▁ cosmo nodded , taking another sip , his eyes on the crowd , letting the matter drop as he had learned to do with a good deal of practice over the years . \\n▁ ` ` i hear katrina is causing troubles , '' cosmo noted and lucien sighed . \\n▁ ` ` i filed severance , '' lucien shared . \\n▁ ` ` i know . \\n▁ everyone knows . \\n▁ i ' m pretty certain her phone is fused to her ear , she 's been so f * * king busy . '' \\n▁ this did n't surprise lucien . \\n▁ it annoyed him but it did n't surprise him . \\n▁ ` ` she tried to attack leah today , '' lucien disclosed . \\n▁ he heard cosmo 's sharp intake of breath and felt cosmo 's eyes turn to him . \\n▁ ` ` please tell me you 're joking , '' cosmo whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not . '' \\n▁ cosmo continued to stare at him . \\n▁ ` ` how did that happen ? '' \\n▁ cosmo asked , still sounding shocked as he would be . \\n▁ it was not done to go visiting a mate 's concubine , no matter what you might suspect was happening . \\n▁ concubines were sacrosanct . \\n▁ they were under the protection of their vampire and only allowed in the company of other vampires with their vampire 's permission . \\n▁ to arrive on one 's doorstep with or without the intent to harm was not only not done , it was against the law . \\n▁ to attempt to harm the concubine was warrant for deadly retribution . \\n▁ katrina had likely come to confront lucien and leah had gotten in the way of her rage . \\n▁ it mattered not that lucien was flying in the face of the laws that ruled all vampires . \\n▁ it was leah 's safety that mattered . \\n▁ katrina 's behavior had been xxunk and even though lucien was breaking the law on his own and flaunting it , he was within his rights , even if she was his mate , to hunt her and make her burn . \\n▁ ` ` she arrived on our doorstep this morning spoiling for a fight , '' lucien answered his friend 's question . \\n▁ ` ` and she attacked leah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she tried , yes . \\n▁ twice . '' \\n▁ cosmo let out a low whistle before enquiring , ` ` good christ , what are you going to do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if she continues to be just a nuisance , i 'll let her burn out her temper and move on , which is what i ' m expecting she 'll do . \\n▁ if she ever gets near leah again , i 'll see she burns a different way , '' lucien answered calmly but with deadly seriousness . \\n▁ ` ` you know the council has heard all of this . \\n▁ not only from katrina but from nestor , who was there last night when you kissed leah , '' cosmo told him . \\n▁ lucien was not surprised about this either mainly because he 'd seen nestor watching them . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m prepared to talk to the council , '' lucien stated . \\n▁ cosmo turned fully to his friend , putting his drink on the bar and leaning closer . \\n▁ in an effort not to be overheard , using his mind to communicate , a capacity that cosmo had as well , he asked , and what will you say to them ? \\n▁ they owe me , they 'll allow me leah , lucien replied . \\n▁ yes , i believe they will . \\n▁ the debt has gone unpaid too long and they 're uncomfortable with it . \\n▁ however , they wo n't like it or the idea it may give to others . \\n▁ it 'll be the only such dispensation since the agreement was signed . \\n▁ and they only will if you intend to feed and to f * * k . \\n▁ they 'll have a problem with you taking her as your mate , cosmo returned and lucien 's head snapped around to look in surprise at his friend . \\n▁ what makes you think i intend to take her as a mate ? \\n▁ everyone thinks that 's your intention . \\n▁ it f * * king well is n't , lucien clipped . \\n▁ and it was n't . \\n▁ however , lucien thought wryly , it might take eternity to break her which would be the same thing . \\n▁ i hope to god you 're serious , lucien . \\n▁ cosmo cut into his thoughts . \\n▁ because you attempt something like that , it wo n't only mean war , it 'll mean hunting . \\n▁ they 'll torture you , which you ' ve endured , but they 'll also torture leah … involuntarily , at the thought of leah under torture , hot brands held against her smooth skin , her fingernails ripped out at the roots , acid dripped on her beautiful body , lucien 's midsection rocked back violently as if he 'd been kicked in the gut . \\n▁ his burning black eyes locked with cosmo 's green ones . \\n▁ i mean to feed and to f * * k. i mean to indulge in a taming . \\n▁ and i mean to have her how i want her , however long it lasts after the taming . \\n▁ not as mates , not for eternity , lucien stated clearly and went on . \\n▁ cosmo , hear me . \\n▁ you set straight anyone who says otherwise . \\n▁ if the council intends to investigate , they investigate me not leah . \\n▁ cosmo studied his friend and nodded . \\n▁ ` ` did katrina start that rumor ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked out loud deciding , if she did , he 'd hunt her that night , not wait for her to do something else immensely stupid . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no idea where it started , '' cosmo muttered , shaken , not at lucien 's denial of the rumor but at his unconcealed reaction to any harm coming to leah . \\n▁ first , because lucien did not have open reactions , unless he was in a position of complete trust with the person with whom he was talking and all those around him . \\n▁ which would mean not under the hundreds of watching eyes at a feast . \\n▁ second , because his reaction betrayed his feeling for his concubine which went beyond a desire for a simple taming . \\n▁ this was familiar . \\n▁ cosmo had experienced this emotion from lucien once before . \\n▁ when lucien took maggie as his mate , expecting to live the rest of eternity with her only to have her captured by their enemies during the revolution , tortured then executed . \\n▁ they had not known it at the time but this , for lucien , had been a boon . \\n▁ he and maggie both would have died during the hunt . \\n▁ neither would denounce the other , cosmo knew it to the depths of his soul . \\n▁ further , maggie 's murder had inflamed lucien to the point where he was an unstoppable killing machine during the war , albeit controlled and strategic , but nevertheless immensely successful and exceptionally deadly . \\n▁ avenging maggie 's murder had made him a hero of the revolution to such an extent , with his added mesmerizing abilities and his unparalleled wealth , centuries later he was now an idol . \\n▁ if she had lived to see it , maggie would have laughed . \\n▁ back then , lucien had been content with modest wealth -lrb- for a vampire , for a mortal , he was fabulously wealthy -rrb- . \\n▁ and he had been more than content with maggie . \\n▁ being a hero , and definitely an idol , would not have been something he would have sought , although he did n't . \\n▁ it also was n't something he would have allowed , although he had no choice . \\n▁ he would have found a way to return them to their simple life , just the two of them , for eternity . \\n▁ no hopes for children but no disease , no death , just maggie 's oft - used dry wit , excellent cooking skills , flashing gray eyes and lucien 's complete devotion . \\n▁ not for the first time , nor likely the last , sorrow for his friend and his loss gentled cosmo 's tone . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you should feed , '' cosmo suggested . \\n▁ lucien did n't hesitate . \\n▁ ` ` excellent idea , '' he murmured his reply . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes moved to the blonde on the dance floor . \\n▁ his mind sought hers and he called to her . \\n▁ come to me . \\n▁ she had her back to him and he watched her body twitch then she whirled around , her eyes seeking his . \\n▁ she looked surprised , even anxious . \\n▁ it was n't something that happened , hearing someone else 's voice in your head . \\n▁ then her anxiety melted and she smiled smugly . \\n▁ without hesitation , she moved toward him , slithering adeptly through the crowd . \\n▁ as he watched her move , lucien made a decision . \\n▁ he did n't make her come to him , he moved with the intent to meet her at the doorway to the maze that led into the den . \\n▁ he wanted to be done with this and get home to leah . \\n▁ he had intended to return tomorrow evening for a feeding and another attempt at her taming . \\n▁ however , he decided he 'd talk to her , not instruction , but explanation . \\n▁ and he also decided to do it without delay . \\n▁ perhaps that would hold some sway or at least enough for her to beg him to take her . \\n▁ all day his body had reminded him of his own unfulfilled need to be buried inside leah 's silken , wet , warmth . \\n▁ it had been an error of judgment to give his c * * k even the hint of a feel of her . \\n▁ it had taken a supreme effort of will to set those thoughts aside during the day . \\n▁ no matter how little he had of her , what he had had been exquisite . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' the blonde breathed when she made it to his side . \\n▁ he did n't greet her nor did he touch her . \\n▁ he walked into the hallway , knowing she 'd follow . \\n▁ she did . \\n▁ this hallway did n't snake to the den , or feeding room , of this feast . \\n▁ instead , it was a maze , the center of which held the den . \\n▁ every vampire knew the layout , none of the mortals did . \\n▁ a mortal could only go to the den in the company of a vampire at his or her invitation . \\n▁ if they wandered back in hopes of melting into the feedings , at this particular feast , they could be lost for hours , even days . \\n▁ lucien moved swiftly , surely , feeling her struggling to keep up , not allowing her to get her bearings and within minutes they were in the den . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes went immediately to the steward who noticed him and jerked his head toward another door . \\n▁ lucien wended his way through the bodies on the floor , feeling her behind him , smelling her scent which was no here near as delicious as leah 's . \\n▁ most definitely lemonade . \\n▁ and not good lemonade . \\n▁ ` ` master lucien , '' the steward murmured as he inserted a key and opened one of a half dozen doors leading off the den . \\n▁ ` ` clive , '' lucien returned the greeting and walked into the small room . \\n▁ it was much like any den , decorated in rich colors , the furniture comfortable and inviting , meant for lounging , covered in soft , plush fabrics . \\n▁ lucien had intended to lead leah to a room off the den they visited last night , not to feed , to indulge in other pleasurable activities . \\n▁ however , her extreme reaction stopped him from doing that . \\n▁ he 'd been disappointed but only until she 'd explained . \\n▁ then he 'd been elated . \\n▁ the door closed behind them and lucien turned to the woman . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m kitty , '' she said in her breathy voice . \\n▁ lucien regarded her for a moment then he gave his honest , dispassionate opinion . \\n▁ ` ` what a perfectly ridiculous name . '' \\n▁ she blinked both in surprise and , he noted instantly , stupidity . \\n▁ she had no idea if he was being serious or teasing and with the way the wheels churned behind her blue eyes , it would take far longer than he intended to spend with her to figure it out . \\n▁ ` ` come here , '' he ordered and she stopped the taxing effort of thinking and moved forward . \\n▁ when she was inches away , she leaned in , going up on her toes . \\n▁ ` ` you should know i 'll do anything you want . '' \\n▁ she hesitated and gave him her slightly effective but obviously practiced alluring look before stressing , ` ` anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` if you 'll give me anything then please do me the favor of not speaking . '' \\n▁ he gave her an altogether different highly effective look before stressing , ` ` at all . '' \\n▁ she blinked again , confusion filling her face and lucien was through . \\n▁ in less than a second , he had her in his arms , his tongue lashed her neck and he pulled her head back roughly by her long hair . \\n▁ then he tore into her , her blood spurting into his mouth . \\n▁ he smelled her excitement immediately . \\n▁ neither assuaged the ache in his belly or the throbbing he felt in his cock . \\n▁ her head rolled back , giving him better access and further tearing open her own wound , something which he was certain was also practiced . \\n▁ her arms started to steal around him and he lifted his head without stroking her wound with his tongue to stop the bleeding . \\n▁ the blood poured down her throat , staining her gown . \\n▁ ` ` do n't touch me , '' he growled . \\n▁ her eyes caught his and he saw uncertainty before his mouth went back to the wound . \\n▁ he fed beyond what would have been healthy for leah this early in their arrangement but where he knew he could take this woman . \\n▁ she 'd regenerate by the time she wandered into the den , once invited , open to feeding by anyone . \\n▁ then he swept his tongue along the wound , the bleeding stopped and the skin started knitting together . \\n▁ his arms fell away from her , she sagged to her knees in front of him and he made to move to the door . \\n▁ ` ` is that it ? '' \\n▁ she whispered , her hands shooting out to hold him at his hips , her head tilted back , her eyes beseeching , her desperate need to service lucien in more than just feeding written all over her face . \\n▁ his eyes dropped to her cle * * age and his body responded in spite of his thoughts . \\n▁ he 'd misused her . \\n▁ even with the mortals at a feast he had better manners . \\n▁ hell , even with wats and breed he had better manners . \\n▁ it was leah and his frustration with her that he was taking out on this creature and it was inexcusable . \\n▁ therefore , his tone gentled when he asked , ` ` and what would you like , pet ? '' \\n▁ her eyes flicked to his trousers then back to his . \\n▁ ` ` anything you want to give me , '' she breathed . \\n▁ lucien thought of leah , her stubbornness and the likely weeks of torture ahead for them both . \\n▁ lucien was a vampire . \\n▁ vampires were n't even expected to be faithful to their mates , another frustration lucien had with katrina , certainly not their mule - headed concubines . \\n▁ then he shrugged off his jacket . \\n▁ ` ` stand up and take off your dress , '' he commanded . \\n▁ at once , she did as she was told and lucien was far later getting back to leah than he 'd recently decided he would be . \\n▁ * * * * * it was an hour away from dawn when he arrived home . \\n▁ upon entering the kitchen , he heard the television and saw the flashing lights coming from the family room . \\n▁ he moved in that direction , entering the room , seeing a late night movie playing , the volume turned low . \\n▁ leah was asleep on the couch on her side , her hands in prayer position tucked under her cheek . \\n▁ she was wearing a pair of drawstring pajama bottoms in a paisley of muted colors intermingled with bright pastels with a tight - fitting camisole in robin 's egg blue , one of the colors in the pants . \\n▁ she looked innocent and adorable , the latter of which she was some of the time , the former , only in her sleep . \\n▁ laid out on the coffee table with some of it escaping onto the floor were the remains of what had been an eating orgy . \\n▁ microwave popcorn , open chip bags , cookies , candy wrappers and a small tub of ice cream , half eaten and now fully melted . \\n▁ lucien was not one to partake in junk food , except , as tonight , at a feast . \\n▁ a delicious , finely - crafted dessert , definitely . \\n▁ an orgy of chemically saturated xxunk and diabetic coma - inducing sweets , never . \\n▁ he decided he 'd have a word with her later about this , if he found the right time , which would likely be in the next decade . \\n▁ he lifted her and , as had happened last night , she did n't wake . \\n▁ she simply settled into him , her temple on his shoulder , her forehead pressed into his neck . \\n▁ he walked with a mortal 's slowness , taking the time to savor her scent . \\n▁ his eyes moving over her profile , his arms curling her soft body closer , enjoying everything that was her after having his fill , several times , of her poor relation tonight . \\n▁ this enjoyment strengthened his resolve to be far more patient while he made her understand and brought about her taming . \\n▁ carefully , he pulled back the covers and put her in bed . \\n▁ swiftly disrobing , he joined her there . \\n▁ then he did what he 'd decided to do in the car on the way home . \\n▁ it would , he thought , make leah infinitely more agreeable . \\n▁ not delaying , his hands sought her , one at her breast , the other went straight into her pajama bottoms . \\n▁ his mouth went to the skin on her neck below her ear and he tasted her with his tongue . \\n▁ his fingers worked and she woke on a soft , low moan . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ she whispered , her voice sleepy and sweet and entirely unguarded . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ she drew in a breath , her body stilled then it bucked as if to get away . \\n▁ he expected this , kept her where she was and continued to work her . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ! '' \\n▁ she snapped , an edge to her voice he had n't heard before . \\n▁ his hand at her breast moved up to her jaw , twisting her head as he lifted his own . \\n▁ he took her mouth in a kiss , his tongue sliding inside as his finger slid inside her . \\n▁ god , she felt and tasted magnificent . \\n▁ on that thought he decided , no matter the frustration , he 'd not take another meal , or anything , outside of leah for some time . \\n▁ maybe years . \\n▁ to his surprise , her head reared back into the pillows in order to break their kiss . \\n▁ it was rare she 'd break a kiss . \\n▁ very rare . \\n▁ she was usually as hungry as he was for that connection . \\n▁ even more . \\n▁ her lips parted , her eyes were wide and he watched them flare with an intensity he 'd never seen before from her which was also surprising . \\n▁ she did n't mask her reactions and she was extraordinarily passionate . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve - '' she started and he withdrew his finger , found her , exerted pressure and circled . \\n▁ she stopped speaking , her face softened and her eyes grew dazed . \\n▁ ` ` that 's it , sweetheart , '' he murmured , his mouth capturing hers , her head reared back again but she pushed her h * ps into his hand . \\n▁ he gave up on the kiss , opting for something more intimate . \\n▁ he moved his lips to her throat , sweeping his tongue against her skin then biting her there , a small wound opened but the blood did n't flow . \\n▁ he had to suck . \\n▁ which he did . \\n▁ she liked it as he knew she would . \\n▁ he heard her moan and her body melted back into his . \\n▁ he drew the blood out of the small wound , heightening her arousal in measured , controlled increments . \\n▁ his hand went back to her breast , fingers rolling her nipple and her head fell back to his shoulder . \\n▁ he knew she was his when she started bucking her hips , riding his hand . \\n▁ he felt his c * * k grow hard at her movements , his mind filled with visions of her riding him and , alternately and no less enjoyable , visions of him riding her . \\n▁ he carefully opened the wound further and drew more deeply at her blood . \\n▁ she gasped , her body tightening , he slid a finger inside then another one , both of them stroking deeply all the while his thumb circling her . \\n▁ her h * ps were now moving in desperation , her breath coming in pants . \\n▁ his tongue swathed her wound and he lifted his head to watch her face . \\n▁ he wanted to see her cl * * ax . \\n▁ it did n't disappoint . \\n▁ her neck arched gracefully , her face flushed gorgeously , her eyes slowly closed and her lips parted in a silent moan as her hot , wet sheath closed around his fingers deep inside her . \\n▁ god , she was n't just magnificent . \\n▁ she was so stunning he stopped breathing , feeling it in his gut , lungs and cock , watching her come . \\n▁ he pushed her orgasm further with his thumb . \\n▁ her fingers circled his wrist in protest then imprisoned it as she drew in another breath and the shudder tore through her . \\n▁ he ceased his movements , cupping her breast in one hand , stopping his thumb but allowing himself to keep his fingers inside her with the other . \\n▁ she trembled once , again , then again , before she stilled , spent , her body leaning heavily against his . \\n▁ he held her close , his face in the hair at the back of her head , listening to her racing heart as it settled and breathing her scent , letting it consume his senses . \\n▁ after a while , his hand left her breast and curled around her stomach , pulling her closer as his fingers slowly slid out of her and he cupped her between her legs . \\n▁ he lifted his head and touched his lips to the now - pink wound . \\n▁ ` ` how are you feeling , pet ? '' \\n▁ he murmured there . \\n▁ she did n't move or speak . \\n▁ he lifted his head to look at her profile . \\n▁ her eyes were closed , her head tilted slightly forward . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? \\n▁ are you asleep ? '' \\n▁ when she spoke , she did n't open her eyes and her voice was both very quiet and completely dead . \\n▁ ` ` you did that to me and i can smell her perfume on your skin . '' \\n▁ his body froze and she kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` and when you kissed me , i could taste her blood in my mouth . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' she cut him off . \\n▁ ` ` you forced me out of my home and my life . \\n▁ you ' ve made me leave my friends and my job . \\n▁ during my initiation you caused me more pain than i ' ve ever felt in my life . \\n▁ you ' ve controlled my mind and my body . \\n▁ you ' ve humiliated me . \\n▁ today , you betrayed my trust . \\n▁ tonight , you betrayed me . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' ` ` you win , '' she whispered in her dead voice . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't fight you , lucien . \\n▁ you win . '' \\n▁ remembering his oath to be patient with her , he rolled her to her back and got up on an elbow to get a better look at her . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't understand the way of my people , pet - '' he stopped speaking when she closed her eyes slowly in a gesture of defeat that seemed foul when done by leah . \\n▁ ` ` please give me one thing . \\n▁ just one . '' \\n▁ she opened her eyes and he was alarmed to see they were dead too . \\n▁ ` ` do n't call me pet and please , never , ever again call me sweetheart . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' ` ` may i go back to sleep ? '' \\n▁ she asked with genuine , not false , consideration . \\n▁ in spite of his earlier vow , his temper was rising and with it the feeling he 'd had when he saw her discarded lingerie . \\n▁ ` ` leah , i ' m within my rights to attend a feast . '' \\n▁ she turned her head and looked over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` i know you are . \\n▁ of course you are , '' she said wearily . \\n▁ ` ` you 're within your rights to do anything . '' \\n▁ he decided to try a different tactic and his hand moved to cup her jaw . \\n▁ gently , he said , ` ` i wanted to give you something tonight , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ when he uttered his endearment , she winced , her head jerking as if he 'd struck her . \\n▁ at this reaction , the strange , vile feeling was overtaking his temper and he did n't like it . \\n▁ it felt like pain . \\n▁ twisting , burning pain and it was magnifying quickly . \\n▁ he lost hold of his patience but held tight to the anger . \\n▁ if he did n't the pain would begin to be unbearable . \\n▁ ` ` leah , goddamn it , look at me . '' \\n▁ without hesitation she did . \\n▁ ` ` we need to talk about this , '' he went on . \\n▁ she shook her head and asked , ` ` why ? \\n▁ i promise to be good , do as you say . \\n▁ anything you want , i 'll do i. is n't that what you wanted ? '' \\n▁ no , it was n't what he f * * king wanted . \\n▁ he wanted her trust , her acceptance of his power , his dominance , not to wield it against her , but to use it to keep her safe , protected , nurtured , thriving . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't understand , '' he told her . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to understand ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i f * * king do . '' \\n▁ her eyes locked on his , hers were still lifeless . \\n▁ ` ` then of course i 'll listen . \\n▁ whatever you want , lucien . '' \\n▁ blinding rage wrenched through him . \\n▁ at that moment , he did n't know if he was furious at leah or himself . \\n▁ this mingled with the bizarre , twisting pain and it took every effort not tear the room apart . \\n▁ he watched her waiting expectantly and pulled in breath through his nose . \\n▁ he knew he did n't have the control to deal with this tonight . \\n▁ he needed to seek calm and deal with this rationally not when he wanted to throw the lounge through the window . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll talk about it tomorrow . '' \\n▁ she nodded and asked , ` ` do you mind if i go back to sleep ? '' \\n▁ he drew another breath into his nostrils , attempting to keep a tight rein on his temper , which , fortunately worked . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have to ask me to sleep . '' \\n▁ she nodded again , whispered , ` ` okay , '' then rolled to her side , tucking her hands under her cheek again and closing her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` goodnight , lucien , '' she told her pillow . \\n▁ his hold on his temper slipped and he growled . \\n▁ her eyes snapped open and her head started to twist to look at him but he buried his face in her neck as his arms wrapped tight around her . \\n▁ ` ` you undo me , pet , '' he muttered there , seeking solace in her warm , soft body , anything that might subdue that twisting pain . \\n▁ he felt her grow still before she relaxed then , softly , she admitted , ` ` i do n't know if i can redo you . '' \\n▁ her words were so absurd , in spite of his anger , his smiled into her neck . \\n▁ she kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` but i think to redo you , i 'd have to figure out how to redo me and that ship has finally sailed . '' \\n▁ his smile died and her head tilted forward , not to refuse him access to her neck but settling into sleep . \\n▁ ` ` it 's for the best , '' she whispered as he lifted his head to watch her tired face . \\n▁ ` ` i was always driving everyone crazy with my personality defects . \\n▁ aunt kate 's going to be thrilled . '' \\n▁ her words made the burning pain intensify considerably . \\n▁ ` ` leah , stop talking , '' lucien ordered . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she said then her eyes flew open and to the side and she said , ` ` that 's speaking . \\n▁ sorry . \\n▁ no , i mean … sorry ! '' \\n▁ then she pressed her lips together and turned her face into the pillow . \\n▁ lucien did n't know whether to laugh or to shout . \\n▁ what he did know was that kitty was a very bad idea . \\n▁ he settled behind her , pulling her deeper into his body , something she did n't resist , and pressing his face into her thick , soft hair . \\n▁ he had thought leah had been broken before and he 'd been wrong . \\n▁ he took in a deep breath deciding that he 'd see what tomorrow might bring . \\n▁ when he knew she was asleep , he carefully pulled away so as not to wake her and took a shower . \\n▁ chapter twelve the understanding i woke up and pretty much saw nothing but the wide expanse of lucien 's smooth , defined chest . \\n▁ this was because my cheek was resting against his pectoral . \\n▁ how i slept cuddled up to him like that , i 'd never know . \\n▁ i was n't a cuddling type of girl . \\n▁ memories of the night before and yesterday flooded my brain but , regardless of the pain or maybe because of it , automatically i shifted closer to his hard warmth . \\n▁ yesterday , after taking a very long , very cold shower and then just barely stopping myself from breaking everything breakable i could find , i 'd found myself in a huge rambling house with nothing to do . \\n▁ i 'd finished the only book i 'd brought with me . \\n▁ there was no company . \\n▁ no phone . \\n▁ no car keys . \\n▁ no books . \\n▁ no internet . \\n▁ no cleaning to do . \\n▁ no dirty laundry . \\n▁ no ironing . \\n▁ nothing . \\n▁ i realized too late i should have asked edwina to buy a few magazines . \\n▁ i only had the television and my thoughts and i did n't want to spend time with either of them . \\n▁ i avoided the television as i 'd found , over the years -lrb- with vast amounts of experience -rrb- that there was rarely anything on . \\n▁ plus i usually ate like a pothead with the munchies when i sat in front of the tv , so i made the decision to take a walk . \\n▁ this was a very stupid idea mainly because i forgot my stinking ipod . \\n▁ there was nothing to do but think when you walked without your ipod . \\n▁ too lazy to go back , i forged on and , as they do , things occurred to me as i walked . \\n▁ for instance , the fact that katrina had marked lucien . \\n▁ it was n't something that registered on me at the time seeing as i was freaking out but , looking back , the scratches were ugly and savage . \\n▁ his skin had been broken . \\n▁ katrina not only had not held back , she had the power and speed to get a bit of hers back . \\n▁ and she had n't responded in any way shocked at their fight . \\n▁ it had been like it happened all the time . \\n▁ even lucien 's baiting , ` ` try , '' sounded , in retrospect , as if it was n't the first time he 'd ever said it but as if he 'd said it lots . \\n▁ and lots . \\n▁ and katrina had n't hesitated to attack . \\n▁ katrina had attacked lucien , not the other way around . \\n▁ she had also attacked me , something which lucien not only protected me from -lrb- easily -rrb- but also it infuriated him -lrb- greatly -rrb- . \\n▁ then there was their conversation , katrina saying i was ` ` life '' to lucien . \\n▁ i still did n't know what that meant . \\n▁ what i did know was that something important was going on . \\n▁ something i did n't understand , told myself i did n't want to understand but something that was happening regardless . \\n▁ it was katrina who left and lucien did n't go after her . \\n▁ as far as i knew , he did n't give her a second thought before he 'd turned to me . \\n▁ this all made me distinctly uncomfortable or more uncomfortable than normal . \\n▁ mainly because i was afraid lucien was right . \\n▁ i 'd jumped to conclusions . \\n▁ i had a lot of bad qualities but i 'd never been judgmental . \\n▁ i hated people who were judgmental . \\n▁ they were the worst . \\n▁ but i feared i had been with lucien . \\n▁ regardless of katrina 's words , it was clear that lucien was n't sending her ` ` severance papers '' -lrb- it was n't hard to figure out what severance meant -rrb- because of me but because of something that had been going on far longer . \\n▁ and , no matter how much i tried to stop it , his deep voice saying that love was a blanket that keeps you warm kept playing over and over in my head . \\n▁ he said this not like he 'd read it somewhere and liked that quote or as if he was simply explaining what he thought love should be . \\n▁ he said it like he 'd felt that before , like he knew it to be fact . \\n▁ this fascinated me , scared me and , for some reason , made me very sad because whoever taught him that lesson was not katrina . \\n▁ the house lucien gave me was surrounded by woods except for the huge yard , immaculate garden and the pool -lrb- yes , pool , with a small pool house , no less -rrb- . \\n▁ during my house inspection the day i arrived , i 'd noticed a path leading into the woods and i took it . \\n▁ upon realizing i was a judgmental person and that i probably owed the mighty lucien an apology -lrb- which sucked -rrb- , the winding , woodsy path led out onto a lake . \\n▁ and what a lake . \\n▁ it was huge . \\n▁ the day was warm and sunny , a gentle breeze blew but it did n't disturb the glassy surface of the water which went on forever , the wooded hills around it rising to the blue , cloudless sky . \\n▁ it was gorgeous . \\n▁ there were big , beautiful homes nestled in the hills with paths or steps leading to the water . \\n▁ there were n't many of them though . \\n▁ i counted five . \\n▁ seriously exclusive real estate . \\n▁ i could see at the bottom of the path a long , wide , sturdy pier . \\n▁ not rickety and ill - kept , of course not . \\n▁ it was the kind of pier you tied a fancy speed boat to -lrb- or a small yacht -rrb- . \\n▁ i walked out to the end of the pier and sat in the sun , staring out at the tranquil beauty of the lake , wondering if lucien provided such luxurious locations for all his concubines . \\n▁ if he did , it must cost him a whack . \\n▁ he had to have dozens of concubines still alive . \\n▁ if he did n't , this had still cost him a whack . \\n▁ either way , it did n't change the fact that he 'd provided this for me . \\n▁ ` ` i am so f * * ked , '' i told the lake . \\n▁ the lake , not surprisingly , had no reply . \\n▁ i sat staring at the water and tried not to think of gentle , generous lucien or the fact that , in all fairness , i should open a why i might like lucien vault even if it was only a small , fireproof safe . \\n▁ i also tried not to think about my many bad traits which maybe got my fool self into this mess in the first place . \\n▁ being a vampire 's concubine was my family 's legacy . \\n▁ it was their business , as it were , and had been for five hundred years . \\n▁ in fact , this whole practice had been going on for centuries and people liked it . \\n▁ it was their way of life . \\n▁ who was i to buck the trend ? \\n▁ cosmo 's money had kept my mother , sister and i clothed , fed and housed rather nicely , i had to admit , until lana and i moved out . \\n▁ lana and i shared the same dad or , i should say , we shared the same sire . \\n▁ our sire , from what little i remembered , drank a lot , yelled a lot and got kicked out on his ass by my mom backed up by the arsenal of my aunties . \\n▁ then he took off , sending birthday cards for the first couple of years before giving up . \\n▁ i had n't seen him since i was six . \\n▁ cosmo still kept my mother in manicures , pedicures , a three bedroom ranch - style house , designer handbags and martini lunches with my aunties . \\n▁ i should have thanked him when i first met him , not been cold to him . \\n▁ and then there was lucien . \\n▁ well , of course he was xxunk controlling and a pain in the ass but when he was n't being those two things he was other things . \\n▁ i could n't help but think about the way he was with me when i was drunk -lrb- before he became a jerk , i hasten to add -rrb- and the way he was at the feast -lrb- and he never became a jerk then -rrb- . \\n▁ in fact , when he was n't being a jerk , controlling or a pain in the ass , he looked at me … he looked at me … oh hell , he looked at me like i was life . \\n▁ like i was beautiful . \\n▁ like i was beyond sexy whatever that was but lucien looked at me that way . \\n▁ like i was funny , interesting and he did n't know what i 'd do next but whatever i did , he was going to enjoy it on some level and therefore he was looking forward to it . \\n▁ he was looking forward to me . \\n▁ no one ever looked forward to me . \\n▁ i could barely credit it . \\n▁ i 'd spent years looking for some guy who would keep me away from the concubine life . \\n▁ there was n't a lot i knew before my selection and i did n't know a lot more now . \\n▁ one thing i knew was that vampires could not invite the uninitiated to go to a selection if the uninitiated was in a relationship with a mortal . \\n▁ therefore , i made sure i was in a relationship most of the time . \\n▁ which meant i 'd been in and out of relationships since i became eligible for my first selection at eighteen . \\n▁ out of desperation , because i did n't like to think i was an idiot but that was more likely the case , i 'd picked all the wrong guys . \\n▁ justin , the last , was the most wrong of all . \\n▁ and i stayed with them longer than i should in order to keep myself safe . \\n▁ maybe , just maybe -lrb- and i was n't putting a lot into that ` ` maybe '' -rrb- , i 'd been wrong . \\n▁ which meant two things . \\n▁ one , i 'd have to apologize to lucien for being a judgmental bitch . \\n▁ two , i 'd have to ask him to speed up his instructions so i understood more about the life i was meant to be leading . \\n▁ then i 'd make my decision . \\n▁ the one thing i knew was that , however it went between lucien and me , i was n't going to let him break me . \\n▁ i 'd meet him halfway . \\n▁ if he was n't willing to do that then we were back to square one . \\n▁ obviously , even the tranquility of the lake did n't stop me from thinking about lucien . \\n▁ i 'd heaved myself up and walked back up the path . \\n▁ when i got to the house , i made the marinade , slid the chicken br * * sts in and put it in the fridge . \\n▁ then i decided to spend the rest of the day drowning my sorrows in food and numbing my mind with television . \\n▁ my unfocused sight cleared and lucien 's chest and , incidentally , katrina 's scratch marks were completely healed , became defined again as my thoughts turned to last night . \\n▁ why i had that reaction to him feeding on someone else , to smelling her perfume , i did n't know . \\n▁ but there was no denying it . \\n▁ i did . \\n▁ in all the hateful feelings i 'd had for the last two weeks , having lucien touch me while he smelled and tasted of another woman was by far and away the worst . \\n▁ because it hurt . \\n▁ a lot . \\n▁ too much . \\n▁ i knew it should n't , i had no claim on him . \\n▁ but it did . \\n▁ and i got it then . \\n▁ i understood . \\n▁ i knew why there was always this hint of sadness in the very backs of my mother 's eyes . \\n▁ and i knew the minute he told me i did n't understand the way of his people that i could n't live this life . \\n▁ not as leah buchanan . \\n▁ i 'd have to be a buchanan from the premier family of vampire concubines . \\n▁ not impatient , not short - tempered , not stubborn , not immature , not anything that was me . \\n▁ i 'd have to be the good , perfect , dutiful concubine like my annoying cousin myrna . \\n▁ for what could be years , i was going to have to channel goody - two - shoes ` ` i ' m gon na tell on you '' myrna . \\n▁ and that totally and completely stunk . \\n▁ but , i told myself , i could live with that in the beautiful house , close to the beautiful lake with my beautiful clothes and , it must be said , with lucien giving me mind - boggling , body - rocking , unbelievable orgasms if last night was anything to go by , and feeding all the time which , i had to admit , was sublime . \\n▁ and he would do whatever he wanted to do which he would anyway . \\n▁ then he 'd release me and i could go on . \\n▁ but not with that sadness . \\n▁ he was n't going to get me to like him -lrb- or worse -rrb- and then break me that way . \\n▁ i did n't even know if i liked him and the pain of having him touch me , make my body feel like it was vibrating with life , his big , solid warmth surrounding me , making me feel precious , fragile and , above all , safe while i could smell her and taste her was bad enough . \\n▁ if i actually did like him , i 'd be really screwed . \\n▁ luckily , i did n't like him so hopefully i 'd be safe . \\n▁ it was on this thought that his hand , which was curled at my hip drifted up my back and tangled in my hair . \\n▁ ` ` are you awake , pet ? '' \\n▁ he asked in a sexy , rough , drowsy voice . \\n▁ i tried not to shiver and failed . \\n▁ i also tried not to let him calling me ` ` pet '' feel like it was lacerating my heart and failed at that too . \\n▁ then i tried not to wonder if he called the nameless , faceless her of last night ` ` pet '' and i failed at that as well . \\n▁ i nodded my head , my cheek sliding against his skin . \\n▁ his hand fisted in my hair and he gave it a gentle tug . \\n▁ i looked up at him and his eyes caught mine . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m hungry , '' he murmured . \\n▁ he was n't talking about eggs and bacon for breakfast hungry therefore i felt a rush of heat between my legs and my ni * * les contracted . \\n▁ his eyes went lazy and he whispered , ` ` come here . '' \\n▁ i was about as ` ` here '' as anyone could get but i knew what he meant . \\n▁ i slid up , my body rolling deeper into his as his other arm came around to assist , hauling me up further and pulling me over him so i was mostly on top . \\n▁ his hand guiding my head , my lips hit his and he kissed me . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and all of a sudden i wanted desperately to cry . \\n▁ he was a really good kisser but this was n't our flat out , fight for supremacy , hungry , sexy duel . \\n▁ this was a soft , sweet , morning kiss that felt nice and wonderful . \\n▁ it was then i began to see the flaws in my new plan . \\n▁ his lips broke from mine , traveled to my cheek , down to my jaw then to my neck . \\n▁ my legs moved restlessly as a really good kind of warmth tingled through my system . \\n▁ his hand at my waist slid up my back to my shoulder , over it then , using only his middle finger to touch me in a whisper soft caress , slowly , unbelievably slowly , it traveled down my arm . \\n▁ i felt the goose bumps rising on my skin and they were the really good kind too . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to make you come while i feed ? '' \\n▁ he muttered against my neck and the answer to that was a big old yes . \\n▁ but i could n't believe he was asking me . \\n▁ was this some kind of test ? \\n▁ ` ` can we see how it goes ? '' \\n▁ i asked and my voice sounded breathy . \\n▁ his hand in my hair tugged my head back so he could look at me . \\n▁ the fingers of his other hand curled around my wrist as he studied my face , his eyes thoughtful and maybe even a little wary . \\n▁ ` ` if that 's what you 'd like , '' he replied and i started to nod my head when he went on , a smile tugging his handsome mouth , ` ` but i know how it 'll go . '' \\n▁ he did n't wait for me to reply . \\n▁ his hand brought my wrist to his mouth while he kept his eyes locked on mine . \\n▁ i felt his tongue lash against the pulse at my wrist in a way that was so sensual , my breath caught . \\n▁ his long fingers slid down , curling into my palm , dwarfing my hand in his much larger one . \\n▁ his mouth moved and all i felt was the flow as he began to feed . \\n▁ it 's impossible to explain how beautiful this feeling was . \\n▁ if i had n't felt it , i would n't believe it . \\n▁ perhaps it had something to do with giving another being sustenance , nourishment , life . \\n▁ perhaps it was lips locked and sucking . \\n▁ perhaps it was bodies touching and other connections besides , both physical and emotional , both intimate . \\n▁ whatever it was , it felt great . \\n▁ his black eyes held mine captive as he drew my blood into his mouth and i squirmed , the fire building , the need turning hungry . \\n▁ i saw his tongue sweep my skin and then he let my hand go . \\n▁ i could n't help it , i felt and heard the mew of complaint escape my throat . \\n▁ he grinned , rolled me away and his hand went to the drawstring on my pajama bottoms . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve decided i want you to come while i ' m feeding . '' \\n▁ he said this like it was some sort of tender challenge . \\n▁ i was okay with that . \\n▁ way okay . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i whispered . \\n▁ his grin spread into an arrogant smile . \\n▁ he swept the covers aside and my bottoms and panties were gone in the blink of an eye . \\n▁ he pulled me over him , yanking my knees so i was astride him , open and bared . \\n▁ i felt extreme discomfort at this exposure . \\n▁ for about two seconds . \\n▁ then he was kissing me and his hand was between my legs . \\n▁ this kiss was a ravenous duel , both of us taking which meant , weirdly , both of us giving . \\n▁ then i thought nothing at all and everything i felt was beautiful . \\n▁ his mouth went to my neck . \\n▁ i felt his tongue as i registered my own mouth was tingling . \\n▁ then he was feeding and his fingers were inside me , his thumb manipulating me and it built fast . \\n▁ my heart started tripping , blood singing through my veins . \\n▁ my head tilted back to give him better access , my h * ps rocked into his hand demanding more of what he was giving me and all of it was good . \\n▁ it built fast , it built huge , before it happened i knew it was going to be overwhelming . \\n▁ but it was n't . \\n▁ it was consuming . \\n▁ my cl * * ax was like nothing i 'd ever felt before . \\n▁ it was beyond beautiful . \\n▁ better than even the night before , straight to life - altering . \\n▁ i gasped then stopped breathing , my neck arching back , my h * ps grinding into his hand as it hit me in a wave of pure , perfect , toe - curling , br * * sts - swelling , moan - inducing bliss . \\n▁ i felt his hand in my hair position my head but i did n't know he watched until the pleasure slowly subsided and my eyes refocused . \\n▁ ` ` beautiful , '' he whispered , his gaze soft on my face . \\n▁ yes , there were definitely flaws in my plan . \\n▁ so i did n't have to look at his handsome face gazing at me with such rapt attention , i gave a gentle yank against his fingers in my hair . \\n▁ i did n't try to escape but settled on top of him , my forehead in his neck as his hand carefully moved out from between my legs and both his arms circled me . \\n▁ ` ` did you like that , sweetheart ? '' \\n▁ clearly , he was n't going to do me the favor of not calling me endearments . \\n▁ i decided to let this go and nodded . \\n▁ i mean , the answer was obvious . \\n▁ ` ` good , '' he murmured as his arms grew tighter . \\n▁ it occurred to me my body was exposed and i did n't like it much about a nanosecond before he rolled me to my back , yanking the covers over the both of us . \\n▁ he put his head in his hand , his elbow in the pillow and shifted his weight so it was resting against my side but he tangled his heavy legs with mine . \\n▁ i looked up at him as his other hand came up , fingers curling around my neck , thumb stroking against the now numb wound . \\n▁ ` ` what would you like to do today ? '' \\n▁ he asked quietly . \\n▁ his eyes were both languid and alert , as if he liked what just happened but he needed to be prepared for whatever happened next . \\n▁ i thought this was strange but i was focused on his question . \\n▁ lucien was asking me what i wanted to do that day ? \\n▁ was this another test ? \\n▁ clearly , i 'd passed the last one but i did n't want to try my luck . \\n▁ i 'd always been terrible with tests . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not sure , '' i answered . \\n▁ ` ` what are my choices ? '' \\n▁ his response was immediate . \\n▁ ` ` anything you want as long as it includes me . '' \\n▁ no man would do anything a woman wanted . \\n▁ he might say he would then you 'd somehow end up drinking beer , eating hot wings and watching a game at a bar where the waitresses wore short - shorts and skintight tank tops . \\n▁ ` ` um … '' i thought about it , my eyes sliding to the side . \\n▁ i felt his body start moving so my eyes slid back to see he was silently laughing , his lips tilted up in an attractive smile . \\n▁ ` ` what 's funny ? '' \\n▁ i asked quietly . \\n▁ he shook his head , did n't answer and still grinning , he repeated , ` ` what do you want to do today ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know , '' i answered . \\n▁ ` ` what 's the first thing that comes to mind ? '' \\n▁ ` ` um … '' ` ` leah , think . \\n▁ the first thing . '' \\n▁ ` ` um … '' his voice dipped low , sultry and amused , an effective combination . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't hard , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ ` ` books , '' i blurted and he blinked slowly . \\n▁ ` ` books ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , books , '' i replied . \\n▁ ` ` my stuff is n't here yet and without a telephone or internet or a house to clean or a car and with edwina gone , there was n't much to do yesterday . \\n▁ i do n't like tv , nothing 's ever on and whenever i sit in front of one i start eating like my stomach 's a bottomless pit so i need to go buy some books . '' \\n▁ his face changed . \\n▁ the amusement fled , it went blank and i wondered if this was an xxunk . \\n▁ his eyes shifted away and stared unfocused at my pillow . \\n▁ this would have been all right except i saw close up a muscle jump in his cheek . \\n▁ i did n't think this was good . \\n▁ i had momentarily forgotten that men , on the whole , were n't really fond of shopping , even for books . \\n▁ big , bad , male vamps were probably seriously not fond of shopping . \\n▁ ` ` we do n't have to buy books , '' i went on hurriedly and his eyes sliced to mine , no longer blank but now broody and intense . \\n▁ regardless i xxunk forth , ` ` we could - '' he cut me off and freaked me out by saying , ` ` i ' m sorry , leah . '' \\n▁ now , hang on a second . \\n▁ lucien was sorry ? \\n▁ and he admitted it ? \\n▁ it was my turn to blink . \\n▁ then i asked , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ his face dropped closer and his voice dipped lower when he repeated , ` ` i ' m sorry . '' \\n▁ i felt my heart start racing and lucien did too or he heard it because his fingers tensed on my neck . \\n▁ ` ` you 're sorry about what ? '' \\n▁ i whispered , finding i was having trouble breathing and finding this was because i wanted to hear what he said next . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry i left you with nothing to do yesterday . \\n▁ i was so angry , i did n't f * * king think . '' \\n▁ i did n't know what i expected to hear or wanted to hear but whatever it was , that was n't it . \\n▁ still , i said , ` ` that 's okay . '' \\n▁ his head bent and he touched his lips to mine briefly before he lifted it again . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll get you some books , '' he said softly . \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` and i 'll see that the broadband is activated tomorrow . '' \\n▁ i nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` and , if you promise you wo n't attempt to drive to panama , i 'll give you the keys to the cayenne . '' \\n▁ boy , i must have passed the second test too . \\n▁ ` ` i promise i wo n't drive to panama , '' i whispered . \\n▁ the broody intensity went out of his eyes and he said , ` ` good . '' \\n▁ ` ` i could n't anyway , i do n't have my wallet , '' i told him . \\n▁ his eyes went broody intense again . \\n▁ ` ` or , '' i went on quickly , ` ` a map to panama . '' \\n▁ he stared at me and i continued , ` ` can you actually drive to panama ? '' \\n▁ he studied me a moment , his face softened and his lips twitched . \\n▁ okay then . \\n▁ crisis averted . \\n▁ thank god . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd rather you not find out , '' he said . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't really think i want to , '' i shared . \\n▁ ` ` panama is n't one of my preferred on the run from a vamp locations . '' \\n▁ the lip twitch happened again and his hand shifted from my throat to my cheek then his fingers slid into the hair at the side of my head . \\n▁ he cocked his head deeper into his hand and asked , ` ` what is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what is what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` your preferred on the run from a vamp location . '' \\n▁ my eyes moved to his na * * d shoulder -lrb- this was a mistake , by the way , he had a nice shoulder but i had to power through it -rrb- , ` ` i do n't think it 's a good idea to tell you that . '' \\n▁ his body moved when his head jerked back and he let out a shout of laughter . \\n▁ half a second later , his arms were tight around me and he was hugging me again , his face stuffed in my neck . \\n▁ ` ` probably not , '' he said against my neck , his voice still shaking with hilarity . \\n▁ it was time for this to end . \\n▁ i could easily find things to put in my why i might like lucien small fireproof safe when he was like this . \\n▁ for instance , how good it made me feel when i made him laugh . \\n▁ and that , i hated to admit it but it was undeniable , i liked it when he hugged me . \\n▁ he gave good hugs , tight and warm and with him being so big , i felt snugly and cozy and safe . \\n▁ ` ` i think i ' m hungry , '' i told his ear and his head went back . \\n▁ his eyes were still amused when he looked at me and that look had to go in my little safe as well . \\n▁ he brushed my mouth with his , pulled back less than an inch and rested his forehead against mine . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get you fed and take you to town , '' he murmured . \\n▁ oh hell . \\n▁ that had to go into my safe too . \\n▁ all of it , the mouth brush , the forehead rest and him taking me to town . \\n▁ damn but it was getting freaking crowded in there . \\n▁ he rolled over me , exited the bed but pulled the covers to , not exposing my lower half at all . \\n▁ he leaned in , put fists into the bed on either side of me and said , ` ` take your time , sweetheart . \\n▁ edwina 's likely gone . \\n▁ i 'll see what i can do about breakfast . '' \\n▁ then he was gone , zoom , out of the room . \\n▁ i looked at the clock and noticed it was nearly noon . \\n▁ then i looked at the ceiling . \\n▁ then i wondered if lucien could make breakfast . \\n▁ then i figured , since he 'd lived hundreds of years , during one of those years he 'd have to learn how to cook . \\n▁ at least make toast -lrb- or something -rrb- . \\n▁ then i sighed because i could n't escape it . \\n▁ if he kept acting like this , there was a big , ugly , gaping flaw in my plan . \\n▁ this was going to be hard . \\n▁ really , really hard . \\n▁ lucky for me , one of my bad traits would come in handy . \\n▁ i was crazy stubborn . \\n▁ ` ` i can do this , '' i mouthed to the ceiling , not wanting lucien to hear and hoping i was n't lying to myself . \\n▁ * * * * * i stood at the stove and slid the big spoonfuls of vegetable shortening into the skillet , the shortening melting as it hit the hot iron . \\n▁ as i did this , i considered the many mistakes i 'd made that day and began to prepare not to make anymore that evening . \\n▁ i did n't discover if lucien could cook . \\n▁ but i did discover he could toast a mean sesame bagel and put the exact right amount of cream cheese , smoked salmon and capers on it . \\n▁ as we ate our bagels and drank our coffee , we did n't talk . \\n▁ this was not companionable silence , it was uncomfortable or at least it was for me . \\n▁ i did n't know what to say , seeing as i could n't be me . \\n▁ and i did n't know why lucien was n't talking . \\n▁ and i wanted to know why , like , a lot . \\n▁ i tried to gauge his mood but failed . \\n▁ what i did know was that he 'd attuned himself to me . \\n▁ it was n't that he marked me . \\n▁ it was something else , something new , it made me feel less like i was drugged and more like i was pulsating . \\n▁ it was like he was trying to figure me out , source my mood . \\n▁ i did n't know if he succeeded but i guessed no as his quiet watchfulness lasted all day . \\n▁ i was terrified he 'd want to take a shower with me or worse , a bath , but he let me take a shower alone . \\n▁ my first big mistake was when i was sitting at my dressing table , blow drying my hair . \\n▁ lucien had disappeared while i showered but i heard the shower go on as i was doing my makeup . \\n▁ while i was doing my hair , lucien walked into the dressing room in nothing but a towel . \\n▁ my mistake was i should have looked away . \\n▁ but i caught sight of him in my big , hollywood starlet mirror and my mouth started watering . \\n▁ then he tugged off the towel with me sitting right there and at the sight of all that was lucien , and there was a lot of it , my mouth went dry . \\n▁ he was , it must be said , perfect from head - to - toe . \\n▁ utterly perfect . \\n▁ strong , heavy thighs . \\n▁ muscled , well - formed behind . \\n▁ bunched , defined calves . \\n▁ he even had handsome feet ! \\n▁ and there were other parts of him that made me wonder if he was not a vampire but instead a living god . \\n▁ i jerked my eyes back to my reflection as lucien dressed . \\n▁ he chose jeans , boots , a great belt and a tailored shirt that was stripes of white , baby - blue , midnight blue , light gray and charcoal gray . \\n▁ he wore this untucked . \\n▁ it was pretty much casual wear on any other man . \\n▁ lucien looked like he 'd stepped alive out of a magazine . \\n▁ i decided from what stephanie had said during my selection , and how lucien behaved at the feast , that he 'd want me to make an effort so he could show me off . \\n▁ this was n't tough for me . \\n▁ i was a girlie girl . \\n▁ i made an effort even if i was running to the store to buy eggs . \\n▁ i decided on nice , low - rider jeans , high - heeled , ultra - strappy tan sandals , a matching belt and a great blouse , almost see - through , white with buttons that stopped at my cle * * age . \\n▁ the neckline went out to a vee , it was collared and had half a dozen thin pleats running along the sleeves and down the spine from collar to waist . \\n▁ it was a killer shirt . \\n▁ i did my makeup subtle and left my hair long , in smooth flips . \\n▁ i had no jewelry to put on so , being done , i just tucked my lip gloss in my back pocket as i had no wallet or phone thus taking a purse was unnecessary . \\n▁ then i left the room . \\n▁ by the time i was ready , lucien had disappeared and i went in search of him . \\n▁ when i found him , he was plugging the phone into the jack in the kitchen . \\n▁ i did n't know what this meant to him but i knew what it meant to me . \\n▁ i nearly threw myself at him and gave him a big kiss . \\n▁ instead , i called , ` ` ready . '' \\n▁ his head came up , he looked at me , his eyes went lazy and my stomach pitched pleasantly . \\n▁ then he asked me , ` ` do you have any idea how beautiful you are ? '' \\n▁ my body rocked to a complete halt . \\n▁ it was safe to say , no . \\n▁ i did n't know . \\n▁ i mean , i knew i was nothing to sneeze at . \\n▁ no mothers had pulled their children away from my xxunk and i could somewhat easily get a date . \\n▁ the way he said it , the fact that lucien said it - a man so rugged , so compelling , i 'd likened him to a living god not twenty minutes before ; a man who 'd probably seen his fair share of women in his time - that made it another compliment which was profound and i was definitely not sure i could handle it . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ his voice calling my name jerked me out of my lucien profound compliment stupor . \\n▁ i did n't know what to say . \\n▁ what did you say ? \\n▁ i decided on , ` ` thank you . '' \\n▁ he walked right up to me , his eyes thoughtful . \\n▁ when he stopped -lrb- in my space , by the way -rrb- , he used both his hands to shift my hair over my shoulders and then he curled his fingers around my neck . \\n▁ the whole time , his eyes were locked on mine . \\n▁ ` ` you have no idea , do you ? '' \\n▁ he asked quietly . \\n▁ ` ` i count the fact that i ' ve reached forty and no one has asked me to join a circus as a good sign , '' i told him , his head cocked sharply to the side and he burst out laughing , pulling me to him roughly and giving me a stand - up hug . \\n▁ i endured this hug . \\n▁ it was hard . \\n▁ a stand - up hug from lucien was n't as good as a lying down one but it was n't far off . \\n▁ eventually , after what felt like an eternity but was n't , obviously , he pulled away . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get you some books . '' \\n▁ he drove us in the cayenne to a mall in the city . \\n▁ not any mall but an exclusive one that was surrounded by streets and streets of luxurious boutique shops and classy restaurants , cafes and bars . \\n▁ these were all nestled in between wide , clean sidewalks with lampposts on which hooked hanging planters and big , stylish pots on the walks all dripping colorful flowers . \\n▁ he valet parked and we went to an enormous bookstore . \\n▁ there , he bought me ten books . \\n▁ i thought we 'd walk right back to the valet but he steered me into the boutique streets and seemed perfectly fine with wandering the sidewalks on a sunny day , hand - in - hand . \\n▁ i saw a particularly gorgeous outfit in a window and my heart must have leaped because his head turned to me before he walked me right in . \\n▁ then he went directly to the shop assistant , told her we wanted the outfit in the window and gave her my size . \\n▁ i was staring at him and i was pretty sure my mouth was hanging open when the assistant asked me , ` ` would you like to try it on ? '' \\n▁ i looked at her and was about to speak when lucien said , ` ` no . \\n▁ we 'll take it . '' \\n▁ i watched in horror , mainly because i could see the prices on the register display , as she rung it up and it took all my willpower not to freak out . \\n▁ i stood dutifully beside lucien as he paid , the shop assistant looking at him probably like i did when he yanked off the towel and at me definitely like i was the luckiest woman in the universe . \\n▁ as we walked out , lucien carrying both my bags , i felt it important to say something . \\n▁ ` ` that was n't necessary . '' \\n▁ his hand gave mine a squeeze but he did n't look at me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're correct , it was n't , '' he replied . \\n▁ well , what could you say to that ? \\n▁ except nothing . \\n▁ so i said nothing . \\n▁ i was careful to moderate my heart and i did this by not looking into any more windows so that lucien would n't again go spending hundreds and hundreds -lrb- and hundreds -rrb- of dollars on one single outfit . \\n▁ it did n't matter . \\n▁ this happened twice more with things lucien wanted me to have . \\n▁ a pair of delicate , antique , silver and coral navajo chandelier earrings and two pairs of outrageously expensive but undeniably gorgeous , high - heeled shoes . \\n▁ i tried the shoes on . \\n▁ both pairs , lucien , lounged back in a chair like he owned the joint and staring at my feet , asked me , ` ` do they fit ? '' \\n▁ before i said a word , he looked at my face -lrb- which was probably rapturous , what could i say , they were great shoes -rrb- and then said to the salesperson , ` ` we 'll take them . '' \\n▁ i was struggling with the supremely peculiar fact that it appeared that the mighty vampire lucien , who was most definitely a male of his species , did n't mind shopping when i noticed something . \\n▁ it was the same on the street and in the shops as it had been at the feast . \\n▁ people were looking at him , even some of them staring at him . \\n▁ they did n't know who he was . \\n▁ they only saw a tall , vital , unbelievably good - looking man who was clearly wealthy and held himself with a raw but restrained power . \\n▁ they had no idea he could move faster than lightning and haul me and my fat ass around like i weighed as much as a pencil . \\n▁ they had no idea that , for whatever reason , he was revered by his people , a race of xxunk who lived forever . \\n▁ and they 'd never know . \\n▁ the mighty vampire lucien was walking down a sunny street but he was forced to live a secret life hiding who he really was . \\n▁ memories hit me like xxunk . \\n▁ my behavior at the selection . \\n▁ my response to my first lesson , telling him the way his people fed was sick . \\n▁ when i was talking to stephanie , assuming the people who went to feasts were victims . \\n▁ telling lucien yesterday he disgusted me . \\n▁ this was when i made my second mistake . \\n▁ i stopped walking down the sidewalk but i did it like my body had slammed against a brick wall . \\n▁ lucien kept walking for a stride but turned his head when he felt resistance from my arm . \\n▁ his eyes went to our linked hands then to my face . \\n▁ whatever he saw made him turn to me and take a swift step back . \\n▁ ` ` leah , sweetheart , what is it ? '' \\n▁ my head had tilted back to look at him and for some reason i again felt like crying . \\n▁ before i could think better of it , i blurted , ` ` you ca n't be you . '' \\n▁ he got closer . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ i lifted my hand and waved it around . \\n▁ ` ` out here . \\n▁ you ca n't be you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't understand . '' \\n▁ ` ` you , '' i repeated , pointing at him . \\n▁ ` ` you can move like a rocket and you can probably lift up that car and throw it across the street . '' \\n▁ i gestured to a shiny audi parked next to us and lucien looked at the car then back at me . \\n▁ ` ` you can , ca n't you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` throw a car across the street ? '' \\n▁ he asked like he thought i might be mental . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i answered . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve never tried , '' he replied , his brows drawing together and he got even closer . \\n▁ ` ` what 's this about ? '' \\n▁ i gestured again in a vague way . \\n▁ ` ` everyone 's looking at you . \\n▁ they look at you and they can see you but they do n't have any clue what you are . '' \\n▁ his jaw got tight but i was too much in my tizzy to notice it . \\n▁ then i said , ` ` i was a bitch and i ' ve said some pretty unforgivable things and , for that , i apologize . \\n▁ it wo n't happen again . '' \\n▁ his brows xxunk but they went up . \\n▁ i 'd surprised him . \\n▁ then his gaze turned wary . \\n▁ ` ` what brought that on ? '' \\n▁ i did n't answer him . \\n▁ instead i asked my own question , ` ` if you tried , could you throw that car across the street ? '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' ` ` please answer me , '' i requested softly . \\n▁ he sighed before saying , ` ` without a doubt . '' \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ i 'd just guessed . \\n▁ holy crap . \\n▁ he even made it sound like that would n't be too much of an effort . \\n▁ all of a sudden i wanted to know how strong he was . \\n▁ i wanted to know how old he was . \\n▁ i wanted to know how he could walk and move like a normal person and not shatter glasses in his hand or crush my bones to dust when he hugged me . \\n▁ it was at this point that i was seriously lamenting my behavior in vampire studies . \\n▁ ` ` would you like to tell me what this is about ? '' \\n▁ he enquired , taking me out of my astonishment . \\n▁ i did n't . \\n▁ but i 'd started this ; i had no choice but to end it . \\n▁ ` ` it seems , '' i hesitated , not knowing what to say , found the word and carried on , ` ` wrong , that you ca n't be you . \\n▁ there are n't a lot of people you can be you around and i ' m supposed to be one of them . \\n▁ that thought just occurred to me and i ' ve said some nasty things about you and your people . \\n▁ you deserved an apology so i gave you one . '' \\n▁ i tried to pass it off as nothing , a simple apology . \\n▁ i was wrong and admitted it . \\n▁ it clearly did n't come out as a simple apology . \\n▁ in fact , looking into his face , which had changed again to a look i 'd seen a glimpse of before , right before he slammed me against the wall at the feast and kissed me with savage possession , that he took it as something far , far more . \\n▁ i took a step back . \\n▁ lucien 's arm twitched . \\n▁ it was a simple movement for him , barely there , but i staggered forward , crashing against his hard body . \\n▁ his hand dropped mine , his other hand dropped the bags and both arms came around me in a crush . \\n▁ he kissed me with a savage possession that was highly inappropriate on a sunday afternoon in a street filled with boutiques . \\n▁ it also curled my toes , sent fire straight between my legs and had me melting into him . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , get a room , '' someone who seemed far , far away said . \\n▁ ` ` randy , shush ! '' \\n▁ someone else who seemed far , far away shushed the first someone . \\n▁ ` ` they 're probably on their honeymoon or something . '' \\n▁ lucien 's mouth disconnected from mine and i found i was on tiptoes . \\n▁ i had one arm wrapped around his neck , my other hand was fisted in his hair and i was plastered against him from chest to knees . \\n▁ my foggy mind snapped to and i tried to shut down my systems , my response , the way i liked it far more than was healthy when he kissed me . \\n▁ especially when he kissed me like that . \\n▁ my hand left his hair and went to his shoulder but he kept me close , his eyes hooded but examining my face . \\n▁ then he said something that freaked me out . \\n▁ ` ` i want to believe this is you , '' his voice was low , soft , quiet , ` ` but this is n't you . '' \\n▁ he was wrong and he was right . \\n▁ it was n't me . \\n▁ it was the new , improved me . \\n▁ or at least the new , improved , perfect concubine me before i could go back to the old , faulty , real me when he released me . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't think i can apologize ? '' \\n▁ i asked , giving his shoulder a testing push . \\n▁ he did n't move a centimeter . \\n▁ i stopped pushing . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' his voice was still low , ` ` that was you . \\n▁ the kiss was you . \\n▁ the rest of it is not . '' \\n▁ ` ` what rest of it ? '' \\n▁ he changed subjects . \\n▁ ` ` we should talk about last night . '' \\n▁ i felt my body begin to stiffen but i fought it and stayed relaxed . \\n▁ ` ` if you like . '' \\n▁ his mouth grew tight as his gaze grew sharp . \\n▁ ` ` not . \\n▁ fucking . \\n▁ you , '' he declared , now angry and i held my breath for what was next . \\n▁ i could n't fight with him . \\n▁ the new , improved leah would n't do that , certainly not on a boutique street . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ not ever . \\n▁ i could never fight with him . \\n▁ i was channeling perfect cousin myrna when he let me go but grabbed my hand , snatched up the bags , switched our direction and headed back to the valet parking . \\n▁ we walked in silence . \\n▁ i decided to test his mood . \\n▁ ` ` do you mind if we get a latte for the road ? '' \\n▁ he stopped and looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` what would you say if i did mind ? '' \\n▁ old leah would tell him it would only take ten flipping minutes or at least she 'd glare at him and pout all the way home . \\n▁ new leah did n't know what to say . \\n▁ as i struggled to come up with a reply , he closed his eyes as if patience eluded him . \\n▁ then he gave up , walked us into the nearest coffee house -lrb- there were a billion -rrb- , got me a latte , him a double espresso with enough sugar to down an elephant and we were away home . \\n▁ my third mistake was n't a mistake , as such . \\n▁ it was just being in the wrong place at the wrong time . \\n▁ i was in the dressing room putting my fantastic new shoes on the tilted shelves that showed shoes to their strategic best when lucien walked in and went directly to my purse that was sitting on the dressing table . \\n▁ i turned and saw him drop my cell phone and wallet in the purse , my passport beside it . \\n▁ throughout the ride home he seemed tense . \\n▁ he did n't anymore and i was unsure of his mood and further unsure what to do . \\n▁ was this another test ? \\n▁ the phone in the house was one thing but he 'd put the keys to the cayenne on the key holder by the backdoor . \\n▁ now he was giving me back my freedom , in total . \\n▁ obviously , i could n't run immediately from the house , he 'd catch me . \\n▁ i also could n't run at all because , again , he 'd catch me . \\n▁ still . \\n▁ he turned to leave , caught me staring at him and stopped . \\n▁ ` ` italy , '' he said . \\n▁ i blinked . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` italy . \\n▁ that would be your preferred on the run from a vamp destination . '' \\n▁ i felt my lips part and my eyes grow wide . \\n▁ for some reason , my expression made his guarded face gentle and he walked into my space . \\n▁ i tilted my head to look back at him and whispered , ` ` how did you know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` fiona , '' he answered without hesitation . \\n▁ ` ` fiona ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` fiona hawkins . '' \\n▁ fiona hawkins ? \\n▁ aunt fiona hawkins ? \\n▁ how did he know aunt fiona ? \\n▁ and why would she be telling him about me always wanting to go to italy ? \\n▁ this was just bizarre ! \\n▁ ` ` aunt fiona told you i ' ve always wanted to go to italy ? '' \\n▁ ` ` fiona told me a great number of things . \\n▁ fiona hawkins was my concubine fifty - one years ago . '' \\n▁ this information rocked me so much it was physical . \\n▁ i took a step back but his arm snaked around my waist and brought me forward so my stomach , h * ps and thighs were pressed against his . \\n▁ ` ` aunt fiona serviced you ? '' \\n▁ i breathed . \\n▁ i mean , i knew she was a concubine . \\n▁ she was n't a buchanan but concubines were friendly -lrb- most of the time -rrb- . \\n▁ i 'd known her since forever . \\n▁ ` ` i throw birthday parties for all my concubines , every year , '' he answered . \\n▁ i felt my mouth drop open again as something occurred to me . \\n▁ i went to aunt fiona 's birthday parties . \\n▁ every year . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . '' \\n▁ lucien ignored my prayer and went on , ` ` i try to attend . \\n▁ sometimes i ca n't stay long . \\n▁ sometimes i do n't attend the party but visit with them before or after . \\n▁ twenty years ago i was able to attend . \\n▁ she served fried chicken . '' \\n▁ i felt the pulse of his words shaft through my body and it was physical too . \\n▁ my entire frame jolted with it so much i had to grab onto the sleeves of his shirt at his biceps to stay standing . \\n▁ ` ` or , '' lucien continued , ` ` i should say , you made fried chicken for her guests . \\n▁ she told me before i went it would be the best thing i tasted … for eternity . '' \\n▁ i kept staring at him as his face dipped closer , his black eyes warmed and he murmured , ` ` she was wrong . '' \\n▁ my mouth opened and then closed . \\n▁ i did n't know what to say . \\n▁ what i did know was that he 'd just given me another earth - shattering compliment . \\n▁ he kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` after that i went every year . \\n▁ and every year , you made her your fried chicken . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's her favorite , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' he replied . \\n▁ i put my hands on his chest and commented , ` ` i did n't see you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i did n't want to be seen . '' \\n▁ ` ` you can do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when you can control people 's minds , you can do anything . \\n▁ even disappear . '' \\n▁ i felt my body tense . \\n▁ ` ` you controlled my mind ? '' \\n▁ he nodded and said , ` ` i also marked you . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ that was true ! \\n▁ i 'd felt it . \\n▁ that weird drugged feeling , not as strong as he did it now but i felt it . \\n▁ i always thought it was the oppressive heat of aunt fiona 's kitchen . \\n▁ she had bad ventilation and frying chicken for seventy - five guests heated up a kitchen , believe you me . \\n▁ ` ` why would you do that ? \\n▁ there were no vampires there . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes there were . '' \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ i did n't know that . \\n▁ i 'd been in the presence of vampires before . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` did aunt fiona tell you about me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` as much as she knew . \\n▁ she liked talking about you . \\n▁ she 's very fond of you , thinks you have spirit . \\n▁ she also kept an eye on you for me . '' \\n▁ holy crap ! \\n▁ what on earth did that mean ? \\n▁ ` ` an eye on me ? '' \\n▁ i prompted . \\n▁ he nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` what does that mean ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she told me what you were up to , '' his face grew dark , ` ` and who you were with when you were up to it . '' \\n▁ he did n't look happy . \\n▁ i figured i was less happy . \\n▁ ` ` are you saying aunt fiona informed on me ? '' \\n▁ my voice was pitching higher . \\n▁ ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ he was back to seeming unperturbed . \\n▁ this was unreal ! \\n▁ ` ` so , essentially , she spied on me . '' \\n▁ ` ` not with that , no . \\n▁ fiona listened , she watched and she told me . \\n▁ she 'd also tell me where you were . \\n▁ then i spied on you . '' \\n▁ my body jerked again . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it was n't exactly spying , '' he continued casually , ` ` more like watching . \\n▁ it was highly enjoyable . \\n▁ you 'd get up to practically anything and you ' ve a very expressive face , pet . '' \\n▁ i could n't take this in . \\n▁ the mighty vampire lucien was a stalker ! \\n▁ ` ` why … '' i spluttered . \\n▁ ` ` why would you do that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it amused me . \\n▁ you amused me . '' \\n▁ he studied my face and muttered , ` ` most of the time , you still do . '' \\n▁ ` ` you stalked me ! '' \\n▁ it was n't a shout . \\n▁ cousin myrna would n't shout . \\n▁ but it was pretty damn close . \\n▁ ` ` you ca n't stalk what 's yours , '' he returned . \\n▁ i looked at his shirt . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i suspect that 's what all the stalkers say . '' \\n▁ he threw back his head and shouted with laughter . \\n▁ i did n't feel like putting this in my why i might like lucien safe . \\n▁ this went straight into the why i hate lucien vault , pride of place . \\n▁ ` ` you 're freaking me out , '' i informed him as i pressed against his chest to get away . \\n▁ his other arm joined the one around me and he drew me closer as his face dipped lower . \\n▁ ` ` the minute i saw you , twenty years ago , i knew you 'd be mine . '' \\n▁ yes , totally freaking me out . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' he cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` leah , i ' ve been waiting twenty years to have you right here . '' \\n▁ he emphasized his last two words with a tight arm squeeze . \\n▁ nope , not freaking me out . \\n▁ i did n't know what beyond freaking out was but whatever it was , he was making me do that . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know what to do with this information , '' i told him honestly . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't need to know . \\n▁ i know , '' he returned . \\n▁ i did n't think that was good . \\n▁ ` ` are you going to , um … share ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head and then bent to brush his lips against mine . \\n▁ pulling away a scant inch , he said mysteriously , ` ` you 'll know when it happens . '' \\n▁ then his arms grew tighter and i was pressed against him from chest to knees . \\n▁ his voice turned rough and his eyes went intense when he asked , ` ` are you hungry for dinner or should we find something else to do for a while ? '' \\n▁ i did n't think it would be healthy for me in any way to find something else to do with lucien for a while . \\n▁ fried chicken was n't healthy for you either but i figured it was far healthier to my future than what lucien might have in mind . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m hungry for dinner . '' \\n▁ he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` now why did i know that would be your answer ? '' \\n▁ i decided my best course of action was not to reply . \\n▁ so i did n't . \\n▁ he bent and kissed the pulse in my neck then shifted to my side , his arm sliding around my shoulders and he walked me to the kitchen . \\n▁ after he deposited me there , he disappeared . \\n▁ now , forty - five minutes later , i looked down and found i was whipping the potatoes . \\n▁ dinner was ready . \\n▁ a dinner i 'd have to share with lucien . \\n▁ i looked across the room . \\n▁ i 'd tidied as i 'd cooked which was something my mother taught me to do . \\n▁ the kitchen was relatively clean , the chicken in the oven staying warm , the green beans in their water , the warm homemade biscuits wrapped up in a clean tea towel . \\n▁ i 'd set the breakfast nook for our meal . \\n▁ myrna would definitely have set the dining room table . \\n▁ she 'd have a damask tablecloth , perfectly clean and unwrinkled and a silver candelabrum and fresh - cut flowers from the garden she tended that she 'd arranged herself . \\n▁ i figured lucien would know that was n't me and if i did something like that it might put him in a mood . \\n▁ i had to get through the night before i got through the rest of my however many years with him trying not to put him in a mood . \\n▁ so i set the far more casual breakfast nook . \\n▁ however , i was in a quandary . \\n▁ i needed him at the dinner table and i needed to set out the food . \\n▁ old leah would just shout for him , louder and louder , until he appeared . \\n▁ new leah thought that was n't seemly . \\n▁ myrna would go find him and likely give a low curtsy , begging the pleasure of his company . \\n▁ i took a chance and tried something . \\n▁ lucien , if you can hear me , dinner is ready , i thought in his direction wherever that was . \\n▁ i listened , heard no movement in the house and sighed at how annoying it was that he could n't hear me talking to him when i wanted him to hear me , only when he was eavesdropping . \\n▁ i threw another tea towel over the potatoes , deciding to go in search of him . \\n▁ i turned and saw lucien walking in , his eyes on me , his face blank , his posture strange . \\n▁ it was , somehow , alert . \\n▁ i went alert too . \\n▁ he got in my space -lrb- again -rrb- and looked down at me , his face still blank . \\n▁ ` ` how did you do that ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` do what ? '' \\n▁ i asked back . \\n▁ ` ` you got in my head , '' he told me . \\n▁ so it worked . \\n▁ ` ` well , i did n't want to shout and you can hear me when i ' m talking to you in my mind , so i tried it and - '' he cut me off . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't hear you all the time , only when i ' m listening . '' \\n▁ that was news . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ he waited a moment before stating , ` ` no one has ever done that . '' \\n▁ i felt my eyes go round as i repeated , ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ his expression turned thoughtful . \\n▁ i suspected so did mine . \\n▁ i wanted to know what in the hell was going on . \\n▁ then his expression went watchful again like he was denying something from me , which i thought was weird . \\n▁ eventually , he said quietly , ` ` really . '' \\n▁ he studied my face , his eyes so intent i felt that pulsating feeling again , as if he was trying to source my mood , invade my thoughts . \\n▁ i wished with all my heart i could do the same thing . \\n▁ i wanted to ask what he was doing but i figured myrna would let him do whatever he wanted to do without question , even if he was invading her mind . \\n▁ so i just looked at him . \\n▁ finally he declared , ` ` let 's eat . '' \\n▁ i put the potatoes in a serving bowl and carried all the food to the table while lucien opened the wine and poured it . \\n▁ all the while this happened i had a freaky feeling about the whole getting into his mind business . \\n▁ i added that to my very long , mental ask mom tomorrow list . \\n▁ we 'd served up the food and i was buttering my flaky , still warm biscuit -lrb- it could be argued my biscuits were better than my fried chicken , or , at least , mom and lana could argue about it and they did all the time -rrb- when lucien spoke again . \\n▁ ` ` we need to talk about last night . '' \\n▁ my mouth was watering for the biscuit . \\n▁ when he spoke those words , it went dry and my appetite took a hike . \\n▁ regardless , i bit into the biscuit and chewed , the biscuit like dust in my mouth and looked at him with what i hoped was respectful enquiry . \\n▁ he took in my look and his mouth got tight . \\n▁ ` ` and yesterday , '' he went on . \\n▁ i decided to waylay the talk by announcing hurriedly , ` ` i was wrong about yesterday . '' \\n▁ his eyes locked with mine . \\n▁ ` ` yes , you were . '' \\n▁ my mind seethed . \\n▁ my mouth reminded him softly , ` ` i already apologized . '' \\n▁ ` ` you apologized about some of it , not all of it . '' \\n▁ i pressed my lips together . \\n▁ lucien kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` katrina and i have been mates for fifty years , leah , but i ' ve known her seventy - five . \\n▁ i filed severance from her this week . \\n▁ do you know what severance means ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ he watched me nod and continued , ` ` our impending severance had nothing to do with you and everything to do with you . '' \\n▁ that did n't make any sense and i did n't want it to make any sense . \\n▁ i did n't want to be talking about this at all . \\n▁ but as usual , i did n't get a choice . \\n▁ lucien kept speaking . \\n▁ ` ` i knew things were n't right with rina and you xxunk everything that is n't right about her . \\n▁ being with you prompted me , finally , to make my decision . '' \\n▁ his words did n't penetrate . \\n▁ that was n't true , one did . \\n▁ he called her rina . \\n▁ i heard him say it the day before but now i felt him say it . \\n▁ my stomach twisted . \\n▁ ` ` she loves you , '' i whispered through the pain in my stomach . \\n▁ ` ` she does n't know what love is , '' he replied tersely . \\n▁ ` ` vampires do n't have the same expectations when they mate , leah . \\n▁ eternity is a very long time . \\n▁ it is n't unheard of for there to be absences , sometimes for years , even decades . \\n▁ and fidelity is definitely not a requirement of vampire mating . '' \\n▁ i had the sense he was explaining something about his relationship with rina but i also had the sense he was explaining something to me . \\n▁ my dry mouth went parched . \\n▁ obviously , since my contract stated he had free use of my blood and my body , i could n't expect him to be faithful to his mate . \\n▁ just as obviously , since he had a mate , severance or not , i should n't expect that he would be faithful to me . \\n▁ neither my blood nor my body . \\n▁ it was then something hit me . \\n▁ something so overpowering that stomach twist wrenched the other way , more acute , slicing through me . \\n▁ i had enough experience with the wrong kind of men to know exactly what he was saying . \\n▁ the about face with the orgasm business last night and this morning was n't him wanting to give me something . \\n▁ it was lucien 's act of contrition . \\n▁ regardless of this vamp non - fidelity rule , he felt guilty . \\n▁ i put my biscuit on my plate . \\n▁ then i whispered , ` ` you had sex last night . '' \\n▁ it sounded like an accusation and i wanted to kick myself . \\n▁ myrna would n't make an accusation , never in a million years . \\n▁ and i did n't have any right to make an accusation . \\n▁ none whatsoever . \\n▁ but i could n't take it back . \\n▁ his face went hard . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' i waved my hand in the air , trying to undo the damage i 'd done as the knife in my belly sliced a painful line straight up to my gullet . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't any of my business . '' \\n▁ i tried to make it come out airily but feared i failed . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' he started again but i began to carve into my fried chicken breast and talked over him . \\n▁ ` ` you just be you , do what you want , live your life like any vamp would . \\n▁ and i 'll be me and do my job , no troubles for you , no expectations of you . \\n▁ promise . '' \\n▁ i was looking at my plate , surprised , even at myself , that i 'd just let go of the game and came clean . \\n▁ this was a mistake . \\n▁ i should have kept my eyes on him . \\n▁ ` ` your job ? '' \\n▁ he asked in a silky voice i 'd never heard him use before . \\n▁ a voice that was beyond scary . \\n▁ so scary , my eyes shot to his face . \\n▁ it appeared i 'd made some kind of mistake . \\n▁ a bad one . \\n▁ he was angry . \\n▁ belatedly , i felt his fury had filled the room and i found it hard to breathe . \\n▁ i also found myself confused . \\n▁ i mean , it was my job being his concubine . \\n▁ was n't it ? \\n▁ in an effort to calm his anger , i decided to explain . \\n▁ ` ` i figured it out yesterday , lucien , '' i told him and , seeing as this was slightly embarrassing , my eyes went to a point over his shoulder , before going back to my plate . \\n▁ i put a bite of chicken in my mouth then looked back to him . \\n▁ he was silent through this , not eating , his elbow on the table , his wineglass in hand , his eyes scorching into me . \\n▁ i kept going after i swallowed . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd been an idiot . '' \\n▁ i thought he 'd like that but his face did n't change . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve been very kind to me , generous with me . '' \\n▁ i waved my fork around the kitchen in a lame effort to make my point . \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't imagine all vamps are like this and , even if they are , it 's not a bad life . \\n▁ i. . . \\n▁ i. . . '' \\n▁ i stammered , losing my momentum when his face still did n't change but i found the courage to sally forth . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd been wrong . \\n▁ so , yesterday , when i had all that time to think , i decided i 'll do my job servicing you until you 're through with me . \\n▁ no more fights . \\n▁ no more tantrums . \\n▁ i promise . '' \\n▁ he finally broke his silence and said , ` ` servicing me . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` servicing me , '' he repeated . \\n▁ i nodded again , this time more hesitantly . \\n▁ ` ` would you care to explain to me , in detail , what you think your job is leah ? '' \\n▁ i did n't really care to , and anyway , he knew . \\n▁ did n't he ? \\n▁ ` ` you know , '' i told him . \\n▁ ` ` explain it , '' he said . \\n▁ my head tilted to the side in confusion . \\n▁ ` ` but … i do n't understand . \\n▁ you know . '' \\n▁ he leaned forward a fraction of an inch , his voice dipped dangerously low , and he clipped , ` ` explain it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ you , i. . . '' \\n▁ i faltered then recovered , ` ` i ' m available for you to feed and … to … um , do other things , whenever you want . '' \\n▁ his mouth got tight and i went on , ` ` and , you know , let you show me off , go with you to places and … '' ` ` stop talking , '' he demanded and i snapped my mouth shut . \\n▁ something was wrong . \\n▁ i 'd never expected to say any of this to him but i thought the time was right . \\n▁ cards on the table . \\n▁ he won . \\n▁ i thought he 'd be happy . \\n▁ he won . \\n▁ why was n't he happy ? \\n▁ why did he look so … freaking … mad ? \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' i started but he interrupted me . \\n▁ ` ` so you think you 're my whore , '' he stated and i winced . \\n▁ i would n't put it that way . \\n▁ i mean , it kind of was that way but even my mind was shying away from that terminology . \\n▁ ` ` i would n't put it that way , '' i said quietly . \\n▁ ` ` how would you put it ? \\n▁ you think you 're here to service me . \\n▁ you think your job is to let me feed from you and f * * k you whenever i want . \\n▁ your job . '' \\n▁ he spit out the last word like it tasted foul and he could n't bear it in his mouth . \\n▁ ` ` so , how , exactly , would you put it , my pet ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m your concubine , '' i reminded him , thinking that said it all . \\n▁ i thought this because it did ! \\n▁ he watched me a moment and i watched him back . \\n▁ mainly i watched his eyes working and i did n't like the way they were working . \\n▁ then his arm moved , it was a blur and nearly instantly his wine glass shattered against the wall . \\n▁ the strength of the throw was so immense , the glass was sand , the liquid in it splashed in a tall , wide mark against the wall . \\n▁ i stared over my shoulder at the wall . \\n▁ then i looked at him , mouth hanging open . \\n▁ ` ` have you been paying attention , '' he growled , hesitated then kept growling , ` ` at all ? '' \\n▁ i felt my body start to tremble at the ferocity in his gaze . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' i whispered , unsure what i was going to say but , whatever it was i did n't get the chance to say it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve a mind , '' he talked over me , gone was the growl , his voice was back to silky smooth , ` ` to show you what being my whore would mean . '' \\n▁ i had the feeling this was not good . \\n▁ my heart started beating so fast i could feel my pulse in my neck . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sweetheart , '' his voice was still silky smooth , ` ` you would n't like it . '' \\n▁ my breath started coming in pants . \\n▁ he stood , got close and looked down at me . \\n▁ i tilted my head to look up at him . \\n▁ ` ` for the record , leah , '' he said softly , ` ` i did n't f * * k kitty last night . '' \\n▁ he leaned in and his voice dropped to a whisper . \\n▁ ` ` she wanted it , even begged for it . \\n▁ she begged to touch me , begged for the chance to take me in her mouth , begged me to f * * k her . '' \\n▁ he leaned in closer , his hand came up , fingers curling around my neck and i saw him hold his body rigid as if he was controlling an impulse and i held my breath . \\n▁ ` ` i was tempted , i 'll admit , but in the end she did n't smell like you and she did n't taste like you and she did n't look like you so i could scarcely bear to feed from her which is all i f * * king did . '' \\n▁ before i knew it , he was gone . \\n▁ whoosh . \\n▁ i heard the garage door go up , the porsche roared to life and then the garage door went back down . \\n▁ the entire time i sat there , not knowing what to do or how to feel , especially about the fact that he just gave me another weird , but extraordinary , compliment . \\n▁ what i did know was that i , again , managed to screw things up . \\n▁ even though i thought i was doing the right thing for myself , for my family , for lucien even . \\n▁ what i also knew was that i really , really needed to call my mom . \\n▁ shakily , i got up and left the fried chicken , the pulverized wine glass and that 's exactly what i did . \\n▁ chapter thirteen the dream i finally understood . \\n▁ as my head lifted , my legs slid open , his h * ps fell between and my arms wrapped around him tight as if they 'd never let go . \\n▁ and i never wanted to let him go . \\n▁ never . \\n▁ not for eternity . \\n▁ my mouth sought his ear . \\n▁ ` ` i understand , '' i whispered , the budding beauty of it flowing through me . \\n▁ lucien 's tongue swept across the wound where he was feeding . \\n▁ his head came up , his beautiful eyes boring into mine , his blazing with triumph and searing into me like a brand . \\n▁ his hands moved to my hips , lifting , his mouth came down on mine in a bruising , possessive kiss and he filled me . \\n▁ through his claiming thrusts , my mouth against his , i breathed lovingly , ` ` i ' m yours . '' \\n▁ * * * * * ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ hands were on me , my lover 's hands but they were n't touching me in a xxunk way . \\n▁ ` ` leah , wake up . '' \\n▁ * * * * * ` ` say it again , '' lucien snarled but i 'd lost track . \\n▁ i was so full of him ; i 'd never been so filled . \\n▁ it was beautiful , so beautiful i started crying . \\n▁ ` ` say it again , '' he demanded , his hand in my hair pulling my head back , not gently , the pain mingled with the pleasure of his claiming . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m yours , '' i whispered , my eyes focusing on his . \\n▁ ` ` only yours . \\n▁ always . '' \\n▁ * * * * * i was rolled , i felt weight on me , a hand on my arm shaking me . \\n▁ ` ` leah , you 're dreaming . \\n▁ wake up . '' \\n▁ * * * * * he melted away . \\n▁ he was n't inside me anymore . \\n▁ my arms held nothing . \\n▁ everything went black . \\n▁ the loss of him was immense . \\n▁ i felt it through to my soul . \\n▁ fear filled me and i screamed . \\n▁ * * * * * ` ` leah , wake up ! '' \\n▁ * * * * * they were burning him . \\n▁ and they were hanging me . \\n▁ the sentence for his crime was to watch my death before his own . \\n▁ my eyes were riveted to him as the flames curled around his powerful body . \\n▁ i felt the noose go around my neck . \\n▁ i love you , i whispered to his mind . \\n▁ * * * * * the hand shaking me stilled but the fingers curled , biting into my arm . \\n▁ * * * * * i watched his eyes close , not with the pain of the flames with a different kind of pain . \\n▁ i closed my own . \\n▁ i love you too , sweetling . \\n▁ i heard his voice in my head . \\n▁ my heart took flight . \\n▁ then the trapdoor fell out from beneath my feet . \\n▁ * * * * * i came awake with a jerk and a cry , yanking away from lucien 's warm , heavy body , my own prepared to flee . \\n▁ from what , i did n't know . \\n▁ i had my feet to the floor when an arm hooked around my waist and i was lifted up , back into the bed . \\n▁ lucien curled me into his body , cradled in his arms . \\n▁ his back was to the headboard , i was in his lap . \\n▁ i melted into him . \\n▁ in all this xxunk , the most bizarre of all was that i was trembling like a leaf and bawling like a baby . \\n▁ ` ` ho … ho … holy crap , '' i whispered , my voice hitching . \\n▁ my arms were around him , holding tightly and i did n't let go as i kept right on blubbering . \\n▁ one of his arms left me and i felt his hand stroking my hair . \\n▁ ` ` holy crap , '' i repeated , this time without the hitch . \\n▁ i burrowed closer , not knowing why , just that i needed to get close , as close as i could . \\n▁ i actually needed it . \\n▁ i needed to feel his warm , hard , big body surrounding me , keeping me safe . \\n▁ ` ` it 's all right , leah , you ' ve just had a bad dream , '' lucien murmured to the top of my head . \\n▁ was that what happened ? \\n▁ i did n't remember . \\n▁ i just remembered the terror . \\n▁ and the sorrow . \\n▁ no , not just the sorrow . \\n▁ the loss and the sorrow . \\n▁ ` ` holy crap , '' i whispered again , a fresh batch of tears overflowing , this time silently . \\n▁ ` ` shh , sweetheart , it was just a dream , '' lucien soothed gently , his words stirring my hair . \\n▁ i burrowed deeper as the tears flowed . \\n▁ he held me and i held him back . \\n▁ finally , after i had control , i said quietly , ` ` i do n't remember . '' \\n▁ his hand left my hair and his arm wrapped around my upper back , his long fingers curling around my shoulder . \\n▁ it was then everything came crashing back to me . \\n▁ not the dream . \\n▁ lucien and the wineglass incident . \\n▁ my body tensed and when it did so did his arms . \\n▁ my eyes took in what i could see , which was n't much , mostly his throat in the dark . \\n▁ ` ` you 're here , '' i said stupidly . \\n▁ ` ` where else would i be ? '' \\n▁ i did n't know . \\n▁ he seemed pretty pissed when he left . \\n▁ i did n't expect in a million years he 'd come back at all much less hold me tenderly after i had a bad dream . \\n▁ my head tipped up so i could see his face in the shadows . \\n▁ ` ` you are n't mad at me anymore ? '' \\n▁ i saw his chin dip down to look at me . \\n▁ ` ` i was , '' he told me and i braced . \\n▁ ` ` i should n't tell you this , pet , but it 's difficult to stay angry with you when i can smell you . '' \\n▁ he gave me a squeeze and continued on a murmur , ` ` and f * * king impossible when i can feel you and hear your breathing and your heart beating in your sleep . '' \\n▁ this made my heart start beating faster . \\n▁ he went on , ` ` then you were moving , then screaming , then crying . '' \\n▁ i felt my lips part . \\n▁ ` ` i screamed ? '' \\n▁ his shadowy head nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i cried ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ another nod . \\n▁ ` ` in my sleep ? '' \\n▁ i went on . \\n▁ still another nod right before he moved us , sliding down the bed and rolling so we were facing each other . \\n▁ he pulled the covers over us and then his arms moved around me again . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember any of it ? '' \\n▁ he asked , sounding more than mildly curious , and i shook my head against the pillow . \\n▁ ` ` none of it ? '' \\n▁ he pressed and i shook my head again . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think i want to , '' i told him . \\n▁ ` ` it made me scream , '' i paused then added , ` ` and cry . '' \\n▁ his arms gave me a squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember who was in your dream ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head yet again . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ all i know is , whoever it was , i lost them and it made me sad . '' \\n▁ i felt a shudder slide through my body and i pressed closer to him . \\n▁ ` ` unbelievably sad . '' \\n▁ he gathered me tightly to his chest . \\n▁ ` ` it was just a dream , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ this time i nodded my head . \\n▁ but it did n't feel like a dream . \\n▁ i did n't remember it but whatever it was , it felt real or at least the pain it left behind did . \\n▁ ` ` has that ever happened before ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked . \\n▁ i nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` when i was younger i used to have dreams i did n't remember . \\n▁ my mom would have to wake me up but it has n't happened in a really long time . '' \\n▁ ` ` did you ever remember those dreams ? '' \\n▁ i shook my head and whispered , ` ` i hope i never remember this one either . \\n▁ with those , i would wake up scared or upset , '' my voice dipped to nearly inaudible , ` ` this one was worse . '' \\n▁ he gave me another reassuring squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` it 's over . '' \\n▁ it was then i realized what i was doing . \\n▁ and it was a second after that that i wondered if myrna would snuggle close to her vampire after pissing him off royally . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , my pet ? '' \\n▁ ` ` earlier , '' i started , he tensed and even though i did n't want another wineglass incident , especially when the thing he was holding now and very able to throw and shatter against a wall was me , i forged ahead , ` ` i did n't mean to make you mad . '' \\n▁ he did n't reply so i got up on an elbow and looked down on his shadowed face . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry i made you mad . '' \\n▁ he rolled to his back and pulled me on top of him , a hand in my hair pressing my face into his neck . \\n▁ he still did n't reply . \\n▁ he simply started to play with my hair . \\n▁ i decided it was time to get things straight . \\n▁ unfortunately , my mother was n't answering her phone which meant she was probably out at a movie . \\n▁ mom liked movies , any kind of movies , mostly xxunk and rom coms , but she was n't adverse to an action film , the bloodier the better . \\n▁ aunt nadia , who was always my favorite auntie and the one i could talk to about anything , was n't answering either which meant she was probably out with mom . \\n▁ i did n't want to call any of my other aunties or cousins because i did n't want them to know i was such a moron or more of a moron than they already thought i was . \\n▁ i called lana who answered . \\n▁ but she said rafe was going to be there any minute . \\n▁ she was in a tizzy of excitement . \\n▁ i could hear it and now i understood it , but she promised she 'd call me back first thing in the morning . \\n▁ so i was still as in the dark as ever about everything that was happening . \\n▁ therefore , it was up to me to get things straight . \\n▁ ` ` i thought i was giving you what you wanted , '' i told lucien and his hand in my hair stilled for a few moments before his fingers started twirling a lock again . \\n▁ then he said something that threw me way off guard , ` ` i want you . '' \\n▁ me ? \\n▁ he wanted me ? \\n▁ no one wanted me . \\n▁ i was , as i just noted , a moron , amongst other not so good things . \\n▁ this made my stomach feel warm at the same time it made my heart lurch and fear crawl up my spine . \\n▁ this was just great . \\n▁ instead of two contradictory emotions now i was having three . \\n▁ ` ` you have me , '' i lied before pointing out the obvious , ` ` i ' m right here . '' \\n▁ i felt his head move , his lips touched my temple before he settled onto the pillows again . \\n▁ ` ` i had you , sweetling , '' he murmured , using a different endearment , this one old - fashioned and way , way , way too effective . \\n▁ so effective it wiped out the heart lurch and the crawling fear and significantly intensified the warmth in my belly . \\n▁ ` ` every day and every night , i ' ve had you . \\n▁ until today and tonight . \\n▁ now , you 're gone . '' \\n▁ his hand clenched in my hair gently and he asked softly , ` ` why have you gone , leah ? '' \\n▁ something stuck in my throat . \\n▁ i knew what it was but i swallowed it away and pretended it was n't there in the first place . \\n▁ i knew i was lying to myself now but i figured lying to myself was definitely the best way to go . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m here , '' i whispered , ` ` right here , where you want me to be . '' \\n▁ his hand went out of my hair and he moved me . \\n▁ he slid me off his body and shifted me so my back was pressed to his front , his arm tight around my waist , elbow cocked , hand pressed flat between my br * * sts . \\n▁ ` ` remember that , '' he said into the back of my hair when he 'd repositioned me . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` that here is where i want you to be . \\n▁ for twenty years , i ' ve wanted you here . '' \\n▁ his arm tensed and pressed me deeper into his body as i felt his face press deeper into my hair . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't wait twenty years for a whore , leah . \\n▁ you do n't take her shopping for books . \\n▁ you do n't move your clothes in her closet . \\n▁ you do n't take her amongst your people . \\n▁ and you certainly do n't put up with her when she 's misbehaving . '' \\n▁ i decided to focus on the last thing he said because it pissed me off . \\n▁ the other stuff made a lot of sense . \\n▁ it also made my belly feel warm again and i really did n't need that . \\n▁ but myrna would n't get pissed off . \\n▁ never . \\n▁ i tamped down the anger and decided to go with resigned . \\n▁ ` ` so , where does this leave us ? '' \\n▁ ` ` where we ' ve always been , '' he replied , his voice somehow lighter like he 'd not only had some weight lifted but also like he was amused . \\n▁ ` ` but instead of you coming out fighting , you ' ve retreated and put up our defenses . '' \\n▁ oh no . \\n▁ he had me totally figured out ! \\n▁ he pressed closer and stated firmly , ` ` but i 'll get through . '' \\n▁ oh no he would not . \\n▁ not if i had anything to do with it -lrb- which i did -rrb- . \\n▁ ` ` you 're already through , '' i lied and he chuckled which made me want to throw something at him . \\n▁ of course , i did n't . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not , '' he declared . \\n▁ ` ` you are . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not . '' \\n▁ i pushed against his arm , surprisingly it loosened and i turned to face him . \\n▁ i looked up at him in the dark and i said my next in a whisper , ` ` if you want me to beg you to f * * k me , i will . \\n▁ i 'll do anything you want me to do . \\n▁ try me . \\n▁ i 'll prove it to you . \\n▁ lucien , you have me . '' \\n▁ i held my breath , not really wanting him to make me do anything he wanted me to do but prepared to do it nonetheless . \\n▁ his face dipped closer to mine but stopped a breath away giving me the impression he could see in the dark . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want you to beg , sweetling . \\n▁ it is n't about that . \\n▁ that was just a test , which you failed . \\n▁ if you 'd let go , just a little bit , i 'll show you what it is about . '' \\n▁ ` ` tell me , '' i urged . \\n▁ ` ` there are no words . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , try to tell me . '' \\n▁ he hesitated then he said , ` ` trust . '' \\n▁ i blinked in the dark . \\n▁ ` ` trust ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve told you this before , you need to trust me , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` with what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` with everything . '' \\n▁ was he crazy ? \\n▁ he wanted me to trust him ? \\n▁ with everything ? \\n▁ then , when he was sick of me , he 'd let me go and move onto his next concubine , doing this for eternity . \\n▁ he had to be crazy ! \\n▁ he would , of course , throw me birthday parties and maybe , as decades passed , recruit me to help him stalk his next obsession . \\n▁ boy , that would be fun . \\n▁ it took a lot out of me and it was really not a nice thing to do but self - preservation forced me to curl closer to him and lie yet again . \\n▁ ` ` you have my trust . '' \\n▁ it was nearly imperceptible but i could swear i felt his body give a small jerk . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't think i know how it feels ? '' \\n▁ he asked and his voice was no longer mellow and amused , it was edging toward anger . \\n▁ i had , inadvertently , made a tactical error . \\n▁ i attempted to salvage the situation . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' i started . \\n▁ i failed to salvage the situation . \\n▁ he kept right on talking . \\n▁ ` ` when the taming is complete , leah , it is n't completed with words or a ceremony . \\n▁ it happens through actions and feelings . '' \\n▁ his words took the breath out of me . \\n▁ or , i should say , one particular word . \\n▁ ` ` the taming ? '' \\n▁ ` ` the taming , '' he said calmly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m taming you . '' \\n▁ i felt old leah slipping back into place . \\n▁ ` ` you 're taming me ? '' \\n▁ his body tensed and his arm tightened around me in a way that felt like containment . \\n▁ even so , his voice was still calm when he replied , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` taming , '' i repeated . \\n▁ now he sounded like he was smiling when he repeated , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` does that mean what i think it means ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m guessing that 's unlikely , '' he answered . \\n▁ this did not make me feel any better . \\n▁ ` ` have you done this … '' i could barely bring myself to say it but i forced myself to say it , ` ` taming business a lot ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not recently , no . \\n▁ but i used to do it before the revolution on occasion . \\n▁ but only if my prey was special , '' he held me closer and his voice got softer , ` ` like you . '' \\n▁ i figured he thought that this was one of his profound compliments . \\n▁ i did not . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m tired , '' i announced suddenly . \\n▁ and i was . \\n▁ very tired . \\n▁ of my crazy life ! \\n▁ most especially the crazy vampire who was sharing my crazy life -lrb- against my will , i might add -rrb- . \\n▁ he was silent for several moments . \\n▁ then his body moved like he was laughing . \\n▁ i ground my teeth together when i realized he was , indeed , laughing . \\n▁ he must have heard my teeth grinding because his laughter became vocal . \\n▁ i visualized myself kicking him in the shin . \\n▁ it was childish , but it worked . \\n▁ ` ` that would n't be a very nice thing to do , my pet , '' he whispered and my body went still . \\n▁ he 'd seen me visualizing . \\n▁ god , i hated him ! \\n▁ i tried to pull away but his arm locked . \\n▁ ` ` will you please let me go ? '' \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he asked , still chuckling . \\n▁ ` ` so i can get comfortable , '' i snapped . \\n▁ myrna would never snap but screw myrna . \\n▁ if there was a snapping moment , this was it . \\n▁ he settled his heavy weight into me , shifting me to my back , his legs tangling with mine , his arm still caging me in , keeping me close . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't comfortable , '' i declared on yet another lie . \\n▁ ` ` mm , '' he murmured against my temple and a happy trill glided across my skin -lrb- something else i ignored -rrb- , ` ` i disagree . '' \\n▁ okay , i had to get control . \\n▁ as much as i detested asking it , i had to . \\n▁ what would myrna do ? \\n▁ i wracked my brain . \\n▁ then i had it . \\n▁ ` ` whatever you wish , lucien , '' i mumbled obediently . \\n▁ he chuckled low yet again , kissed my temple then ordered , ` ` go to sleep , leah . '' \\n▁ i did n't answer . \\n▁ i also did n't go to sleep . \\n▁ i decided to fume . \\n▁ this lasted for about five minutes . \\n▁ then his heat , his heaviness , his soft breath stirring my hair , his large , powerful body at rest by mine , a body which could likely keep me safe from just about anything in the world , permeated my subconscious and a second later , i was dead to the world . \\n▁ chapter fourteen the explosion ` ` what 's happened to leah ? '' \\n▁ even after hearing stephanie 's whispered question , lucien did n't take his eyes from leah as she slid away from them through the crowded room . \\n▁ he heard leah saying softly again and again , ` ` excuse me , '' as she moved amongst the crush of opera patrons on her way to the restroom . \\n▁ sometimes she would give them a small polite smile . \\n▁ as she moved and spoke , the patrons turned to look . \\n▁ the men would keep looking . \\n▁ the women would either stare or glare . \\n▁ she disappeared from sight and lucien 's eyes stayed where he last saw her . \\n▁ three weeks . \\n▁ it had been three weeks since their sunday together , a day that started unbelievably well and ended unbelievably badly . \\n▁ and then she had her dream . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ stephanie called but , lost in thought , lucien did n't respond . \\n▁ he continued to watch the entrance to the hall where he 'd last seen leah . \\n▁ he feared he 'd broken her . \\n▁ not how he 'd intended , in a way he could never have imagined nor would ever have wanted . \\n▁ for the first week , he saw her come through every once in a while . \\n▁ often her eyes would flash . \\n▁ other times she 'd look painfully and hilariously undecided , as if she had one reaction but was forcing herself to display another . \\n▁ she also lost her patience while attempting to make him some complicated souffle that went tremendously badly however her foul - mouthed tirade after it collapsed was immensely entertaining . \\n▁ the disastrous souffle gave him hope . \\n▁ so did the dreams . \\n▁ she 'd had four more , all the same . \\n▁ all of them starting with her moving , nearly writhing against him as if in ecstasy but this would end abruptly in a blood - chilling scream . \\n▁ seconds later , he 'd hear her words whispered in his head . \\n▁ i love you . \\n▁ shortly after came the choking sobs , she 'd wake and attempt to flee . \\n▁ he 'd catch her and hold her until her trembling and tears ceased . \\n▁ after the second dream they 'd stopped talking about it . \\n▁ she would simply hold onto him in a way that felt desperate . \\n▁ he 'd stroke her back or her hair until her body relaxed and she fell asleep in his arms . \\n▁ lucien closed his eyes tightly as the words sounded softly in his head . \\n▁ i love you . \\n▁ those words , those three f * * king words , whispered in his head . \\n▁ it was n't even the words , it was the way she said them . \\n▁ as if she 'd pulled them out of her soul and offered them to him like a gift . \\n▁ and he knew she was talking to him , dreaming of him . \\n▁ she would n't be in his head if she was n't . \\n▁ he would n't be able to hear it . \\n▁ he also knew she was n't lying when she said she did n't remember . \\n▁ something was blocking the memory , likely the power behind the emotion of whatever made her scream and sob in such a f * * king heartbroken way it was difficult to witness . \\n▁ lucien did n't know what to make of the intensity of her dream and the aftermath or what they meant to him or leah except it was pretty clear her earlier hostility toward him , and now her deference to him , were defense mechanisms . \\n▁ he 'd managed to establish a connection but she was n't allowing herself to embrace it . \\n▁ even so , he did n't like that leah had them . \\n▁ her terror was stark , her pain palpable and he was powerless to stop them , a feeling he never felt and one he did n't much like . \\n▁ but he had to admit , he was intrigued by the words and the intensity with which she spoke them . \\n▁ even if he felt somehow tortured by them . \\n▁ it was the dream , and the souffle , that made him think she 'd never be able to continue her latest game . \\n▁ however , the last two weeks , except for when she had the dreams or when he was feeding and even then she seemed to hold herself back , all that was leah had vanished . \\n▁ it appeared not to be a struggle in the slightest . \\n▁ none of his leah came shining through even for a moment . \\n▁ she was like every concubine he 'd had for five hundred years . \\n▁ perhaps not as worshipful as some or as obviously greedy for the feeding as others but mostly just the same . \\n▁ he missed her . \\n▁ he actually missed their verbal xxunk , her comical one - liners delivered when she was angry , her strength of will , her stubbornness , her curiosity , her spirit which filled the house . \\n▁ all that was gone , including his anticipation of coming home to see what she 'd be up to next . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? \\n▁ luce ? \\n▁ hell xxrep 4 o , luce ! \\n▁ are you in there ? '' \\n▁ stephanie called and lucien 's gaze moved to her . \\n▁ ` ` sorry , '' he muttered and stephanie 's eyes narrowed on his face . \\n▁ ` ` something 's not right in lucien and leah land , '' stephanie noted . \\n▁ lucien took a sip from his drink before saying , ` ` everything 's fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` does n't seem fine to me , '' stephanie shot back . \\n▁ ` ` leah looks like leah , gorgeous as ever . \\n▁ and she smells like leah . \\n▁ and she walks like leah . \\n▁ and talks somewhat like leah . \\n▁ but she 's not leah . '' \\n▁ finally lucien 's eyes focused on his friend . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't any of your business , xxunk . '' \\n▁ stephanie was one of the very few -lrb- in fact , there were only two , her and cosmo -rrb- who would look at lucien 's face at that moment and issue a challenge . \\n▁ and that was what she did . \\n▁ ` ` well , i beg to differ . \\n▁ leah 's become my friend and i ' m worried . \\n▁ i ' ve been over there twice this week . \\n▁ it 's like i drove into stepford and it 's eerie . \\n▁ i do n't like it and edwina is none too happy either . '' \\n▁ ` ` everything will be fine , '' lucien said , turning to look back toward the hall . \\n▁ ` ` i hope so , luce , and i hope you make it soon . \\n▁ because there is no way a woman like that can hold back that much without exploding and i ' m not certain even you will want to be around when she lets it all out . '' \\n▁ lucien sliced a glance at her , the tone of his voice making his words crystal clear . \\n▁ ` ` we 're done talking about this . '' \\n▁ stephanie held his gaze for long moments then changed the subject to one that was only slightly less annoying . \\n▁ ` ` rumors are flying , '' she informed him . \\n▁ ` ` rumors always fly , '' lucien returned dismissively . \\n▁ ` ` not rumors like this , '' she retorted . \\n▁ ` ` heard word that the council is going to open an investigation tomorrow into what you 're doing with leah . '' \\n▁ lucien glanced back at the hall with unconcern . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve heard that too . '' \\n▁ ` ` well , i bet you have n't heard that rafe told dante who told hamish who told me that he 's considering moving in with lana buchanan . '' \\n▁ lucien 's narrowed eyes sliced back to stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` thought that 'd get your attention , '' she muttered . \\n▁ ` ` tell me you 're joking , '' he demanded . \\n▁ she shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` what 's he thinking ? '' \\n▁ lucien ground out . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m guessing the same thing as you . \\n▁ he wants more than lana 's blood . \\n▁ the xxunk are a tasty lot . \\n▁ i had one myself years ago , i know . \\n▁ you boys like different smells though and you want to get yourselves some of that . '' \\n▁ lucien 's body moved , turning toward stephanie in a way that made her tense . \\n▁ ` ` are you bored , xxunk ? \\n▁ do you want me to challenge you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m saying it like it is , '' she returned . \\n▁ ` ` if all i wanted was a piece of ass , i would have seduced leah twenty years ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh right , '' stephanie scoffed , ` ` you want the taming . '' \\n▁ lucien , who , these days with leah behaving the way she was , had little patience , lost the little he had . \\n▁ ` ` what are you driving at ? '' \\n▁ he clipped . \\n▁ ` ` what i ' m driving at , lucien , is i ' m all for this . \\n▁ vampires being vampires . \\n▁ these ridiculous rules being shattered to smithereens . \\n▁ i want the hunt , just like we all do . \\n▁ i miss it . \\n▁ i yearn for it . \\n▁ the problem i have , right now , with you , is that you ' ve gone off target . \\n▁ you 're messing with leah and things are obviously not right . '' \\n▁ ` ` stay out of it , xxunk , '' he warned . \\n▁ ` ` she 's changed , '' stephanie shot back . \\n▁ ` ` she 's changed before . \\n▁ you know how it is , how they fight it . \\n▁ she 'll change again . '' \\n▁ ` ` i suspect she will but are you prepared for when she does ? '' \\n▁ for the first time in days , lucien smiled . \\n▁ stephanie growled . \\n▁ then she hissed , ` ` you do n't get it , do you ? '' \\n▁ lucien 's smile grew arrogant . \\n▁ ` ` not right now but i ' m going to . '' \\n▁ stephanie leaned in . \\n▁ ` ` what , exactly , do you think she 's working so damned hard to protect herself from , lucien ? \\n▁ have you ever thought of that ? \\n▁ you ' ve tamed many mortals , what happened with the one who gave you the toughest fight ? '' \\n▁ the smile died from his face and lucien felt himself flinch . \\n▁ stephanie saw it and went in for the kill . \\n▁ speaking quietly , she said , ` ` that 's right , she fell in love with you . \\n▁ luckily for maggie , you fell in love with her too and you could make her your mate . \\n▁ that is n't an option for leah . \\n▁ so what happens to her when she directs all that feeling and life - force inside her at you then , when you 're done with her , where does she go from there ? '' \\n▁ i love you . \\n▁ the words spoken in leah 's heartfelt whisper , like they did time and again , day after day , came unbidden into his head . \\n▁ lucien did n't like what he was feeling . \\n▁ ` ` stay out of it , xxunk . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m in it , we all are . '' \\n▁ she got closer . \\n▁ ` ` if rafe moves in with lana , takes her as a lover , the council is not going to look kindly on what you 're doing with leah . \\n▁ they might have before , to pay back their debt but this is spreading . \\n▁ they 'll want to nip it in the bud and the best way to do that is shut down its source . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll talk to rafe . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes ? \\n▁ and what will you say ? '' \\n▁ lucien held stephanie 's gaze and made a decision . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll congratulate him on his new home . '' \\n▁ her eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` you 're talking about revolution . '' \\n▁ ` ` why are you acting surprised ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked . \\n▁ ` ` you knew that was a possibility from the beginning . '' \\n▁ she threw up a hand . \\n▁ ` ` this is happening too fast , luce . \\n▁ we 're not prepared . '' \\n▁ ` ` it already happened , xxunk . \\n▁ i drew the line the minute you and cosmo sheltered leah from anyone declaring their intentions at her selection . \\n▁ since then everyone 's been taking their positions on their side of the line . \\n▁ the council will have to take that into consideration when they make their judgment . '' \\n▁ ` ` you think they 'll roll over ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i think they must understand on some level that their traditions are antiquated and i ' m counting on them being forward thinking . '' \\n▁ ` ` and if they 're not ? '' \\n▁ lucien leveled his eyes at her . \\n▁ ` ` you took your position on the line , xxunk , are you changing your mind ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when i chose my side , i did n't know leah . '' \\n▁ lucien 's brows drew together . \\n▁ ` ` and what does this have to do with leah ? '' \\n▁ he watched , surprised , as stephanie 's face grew pale , her mouth went slack and her eyes slid from his . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk ? '' \\n▁ he prompted . \\n▁ her eyes slid back and she whispered , ` ` you have to ask that ? \\n▁ you ? '' \\n▁ lucien , unfortunately , chose not to respond . \\n▁ so stephanie kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` what did the last revolution have to do with maggie , lucien ? '' \\n▁ lucien felt every inch of his body stretch taut . \\n▁ ` ` we 're placing her in danger , '' stephanie went on . \\n▁ ` ` leah will not be in any danger , '' lucien clipped . \\n▁ ` ` you 're so certain ? '' \\n▁ lucien moved forward a very threatening inch . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he growled . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m very certain . '' \\n▁ stephanie watched him , her eyes not moving from his , something that looked like understanding finally flashing in hers . \\n▁ then , seemingly appeased , even now actually pleased , she nodded and looked over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` she 's coming back , '' stephanie noted and lucien turned . \\n▁ leah was moving toward them , squeezing between the bodies with more small smiles and murmured pardons . \\n▁ he noticed immediately she 'd reapplied her lip gloss . \\n▁ she was wearing an orchid - colored strapless dress . \\n▁ simple . \\n▁ elegant . \\n▁ no adornment on the dress only a deep slit up the center front that stopped at the swell of her thighs and a short train , the weight of which dragged the skirt back exposing her shapely legs . \\n▁ she wore the pair of high - heeled , burnished gold sandals he 'd bought for her when they were shopping . \\n▁ her hair was not simple however , it was elegant . \\n▁ she 'd let it dry in natural waves , then pulled it up and back in a way that was stylish but messy , innocent - looking but sexy . \\n▁ strategically placed in it , she 'd affixed the dozen tiny gold - filigreed butterfly hair clips he 'd bought her and at her throat from a delicate gold chain hung another larger filigreed butterfly . \\n▁ the ones in her hair , the wings were near to closed , the one at her throat the wings where spanned . \\n▁ he 'd bought her the jewelry because he liked it , he thought it suited her and he wanted a reaction . \\n▁ he 'd been cautious with her ever since the night he threw the wineglass and she 'd had her first dream . \\n▁ he 'd backed off and used extreme patience , attempting to draw her out gently . \\n▁ none of which , incidentally , was working . \\n▁ he 'd given the jewelry to her the night before , right before they went to bed when he told her they 'd be going out that evening . \\n▁ she had not been overwhelmed by this gesture . \\n▁ he 'd received no radiant smile . \\n▁ in fact , she 'd only ever smiled at him once and never repeated it . \\n▁ instead , she 'd been only dutifully grateful . \\n▁ nothing more . \\n▁ he watched her get closer thinking he 'd been absolutely right . \\n▁ the dress , the shoes and the jewelry all very much suited her . \\n▁ the blank expression on her beautiful face very much did not . \\n▁ she was less than ten feet away when a man 's hand curled on her upper arm , stopping her progress . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ lucien heard the voice , his eyes moved to the man . \\n▁ he recognized him and without delay lucien moved . \\n▁ he would have liked to have moved faster but he forced himself to go with a mortal 's slowness and it was at that moment lucien hoped there was revolution , that vampires would be freed to be who they were and do what they liked . \\n▁ for instance , being at leah 's side in a split second , grabbing her and leaping across the room instead of having to xxunk his way excruciatingly slowly toward her . \\n▁ ` ` justin ? '' \\n▁ leah 's voice was stunned and not in a happy way . \\n▁ ` ` leah , girl , what are you doing here ? '' \\n▁ justin 's voice was also stunned , definitely in a happy way . \\n▁ lucien made it to her side in time for justin to pull leah into his arms . \\n▁ she visibly stiffened . \\n▁ so did lucien , a half a second before he moved closer in order to extricate her from an embrace with her ex - lover . \\n▁ leah got there before him . \\n▁ she put her hands to justin 's waist and pushed away . \\n▁ her shoulder met lucien 's chest and her head jerked up to look at him . \\n▁ and then she did something that stunned lucien . \\n▁ she turned to him , sliding her arm along his back , her fingers curling into his waist . \\n▁ she leaned the front of her body into his side , pressing close . \\n▁ the act was smoothly done as if she curled into him all the time . \\n▁ it was also immensely proprietary in a beguiling , feminine way . \\n▁ he liked it , a great deal , and therefore relaxed into it . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , this is justin . '' \\n▁ she gestured with her hand then turned from him to justin . \\n▁ ` ` justin , meet lucien . '' \\n▁ lucien looked at justin who , lucien was pleased to note , was now not looking so happy to see leah . \\n▁ his eyes were darting back and forth between the two of them and his faced had paled slightly . \\n▁ unfortunately , lucien had to break contact with leah who 'd burrowed under his right arm to shake the man 's hand . \\n▁ ` ` justin , '' he murmured . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' justin murmured back , shaking his hand . \\n▁ it took effort but lucien stopped himself from crushing all the bones in justin 's hand . \\n▁ regardless , justin winced behind the power of lucien 's grip . \\n▁ the minute their hands broke , leah moved back in , assuming the same position but this time she rested her other hand on his upper abdominals . \\n▁ it was a light touch but it spoke volumes . \\n▁ as with most moments with leah , but especially that moment , lucien had the raging desire to kiss her . \\n▁ ` ` what are you doing here ? '' \\n▁ she asked justin , her voice not entirely friendly , not exactly unfriendly . \\n▁ she was testing the waters and lucien decided to give her the lead in this uncertain situation . \\n▁ ` ` i just asked the same thing , '' justin replied , his voice was entirely unfriendly , his pleasure at seeing her had evaporated . \\n▁ ` ` you first , '' leah said , she read his tone and her words were frosted . \\n▁ lucien settled in to watch . \\n▁ justin looked between lucien and leah again , his eyes traveling down to lucien 's middle . \\n▁ lucien slid his arm around leah , cupping his fingers on her shoulder . \\n▁ justin 's eyes shifted , he watched this and his mouth grew tight . \\n▁ then he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` at the last minute , they changed their minds and instead of transferring me to seattle , they transferred me here . '' \\n▁ ` ` you live here ? '' \\n▁ leah asked and lucien felt her body tensing . \\n▁ not good news , at least not for leah . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i do , '' justin replied . \\n▁ ` ` now … you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i live here too , '' leah told him and lucien watched as justin 's eyes grew wide with disbelief . \\n▁ ` ` you live here ? '' \\n▁ he whispered . \\n▁ ` ` well , not here , in the city , '' leah explained . \\n▁ ` ` i live in dragon lake . '' \\n▁ justin 's eyes , already wide , went huge . \\n▁ ` ` dragon lake ? '' \\n▁ his voice had dropped even lower then he whistled before stating , ` ` that explains it . '' \\n▁ ` ` explains what ? '' \\n▁ leah asked sharply . \\n▁ ` ` what would drag you away from that family and all those friends of yours . \\n▁ obviously , if you can afford to live in dragon lake , you must have got a helluva job . \\n▁ that 's a pricey neighborhood . '' \\n▁ ` ` we do n't actually live in dragon lake . '' \\n▁ lucien decided it was time to enter the conversation . \\n▁ ` ` we live outside town , on the lake . '' \\n▁ lucien did n't put any emphasis on the ` ` we '' but then again , he did n't have to . \\n▁ justin caught his meaning , his eyes narrowed on lucien and his jaw clenched . \\n▁ he again looked between lucien and leah and lucien heard his heart start beating faster . \\n▁ angry . \\n▁ lucien bit back a smile . \\n▁ finally justin 's eyes settled on lucien and he asked , ` ` do you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` justin - '' leah started , her tense body going solid but justin 's eyes did n't move from lucien . \\n▁ ` ` do you know who i am ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` justin - '' leah began again but lucien talked over her . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` then you know she broke up with me just five months ago . '' \\n▁ ` ` justin ! '' \\n▁ leah snapped but lucien again spoke over her . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' lucien repeated . \\n▁ justin 's eyes shot to leah . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a fast mover . \\n▁ or were you with him before you finished with me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` justin - '' she started yet again , his name a shard of ice but this time justin talked over her . \\n▁ ` ` nice necklace , ley - lo . '' \\n▁ his voice was snide and it was lucien 's turn to go tense . \\n▁ ` ` do we have to do this ? '' \\n▁ leah asked , her tone hard saying it was not a question at all and that they were not going to do ` ` this '' . \\n▁ justin disagreed . \\n▁ ` ` oh , i do n't know , '' he drawled sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` six months ago i was told i was being transferred , with a f * * king great raise and a huge bonus . \\n▁ not anything that would put me near dragon lake but it was n't anything to f * * king sneeze at either . \\n▁ you said you would n't move , no way , no how . \\n▁ guess you were waiting for someone who could put gold around your neck and your ass in a two million dollar house on dragon lake . '' \\n▁ ` ` i think you 're done , '' lucien told him and his voice made it clear justin was , indeed , done . \\n▁ again , justin did n't agree . \\n▁ ` ` oh , do you now ? '' \\n▁ leah pressed into his side as her hand came up to grasp his lapel . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , do n't - '' lucien looked down at her and saw her face had paled with alarm . \\n▁ but before he could reassure her , justin was there . \\n▁ ` ` he 's a big guy , ley - lo , but you know i can handle myself , '' he announced . \\n▁ leah 's body turned to marble and lucien 's eyes sliced to him . \\n▁ justin was dark - haired , dark - eyed and clearly fit but , even if lucien was n't a vampire , he had four inches and fifty pounds on him at least . \\n▁ however , he was a vampire and without any effort at all , he could rip the man 's head off which was something he would have liked to do . \\n▁ not because he was clearly an ass * * le but because lucien knew he 'd been an ass * * le to leah for a very long time . \\n▁ justin , lucien knew from fiona , was ambitious . \\n▁ he was also callous with his ambition not only in business but often cancelling plans with leah , sometimes important or special ones in order to spend his time clawing his way to the top . \\n▁ justin was so ambitious that when he needed leah to be available to charm associates at a business dinner or the like , regardless of the fact that he often chose work over her , he demanded her attendance . \\n▁ he did this even , on occasion , when she was ill or when she had other plans . \\n▁ the former , she 'd done , according to fiona , once . \\n▁ the latter she 'd told him to ` ` go screw himself '' -lrb- fiona 's account , direct from leah 's mouth -rrb- , which meant they fought , not cleanly or at least justin did n't fight clean . \\n▁ in a fight , as he was always , he was insensitive , selfish and manipulative . \\n▁ justin , lucien now knew , was also stupid . \\n▁ leah tried to salvage the situation . \\n▁ ` ` we 're at the opera , '' she hissed to justin . \\n▁ ` ` so , f * * king , what ? '' \\n▁ justin hissed back . \\n▁ ` ` you think you can stand there and hang on some guy , some guy you ' ve known for what ? \\n▁ a couple of months ? \\n▁ some guy you ' ve moved in with when you would n't entertain the notion for even a second with me ? \\n▁ hang on him right in front of me when five months ago you were in my bed ? '' \\n▁ lucien prepared to move . \\n▁ ` ` i see you 're not done but we are . '' \\n▁ justin , proving his immense stupidity , leaned in and snapped , ` ` listen up , lucien , whatever f * * king kind of name that is , take it from me . \\n▁ trust me , i f * * king know . \\n▁ get out , get out now . \\n▁ she 'll twist you around her little finger , get you addicted to that toffee snatch of hers , then she 'll - '' lucien was done . \\n▁ instead of ripping his head off , which was something he now really wished to do , he did something else which would likely not horrify leah , the rest of their many onlookers and sentence him to be hunted down and burned by the dominion . \\n▁ the last of which would put a world of hurt on his plans to tame leah as he 'd be dead . \\n▁ silence , lucien commanded , justin 's mouth clamped shut and his eyes bugged out . \\n▁ walk away , lucien continued and without hesitation , justin 's body jerking woodenly , he turned and walked away . \\n▁ lucien watched him go . \\n▁ then he heard leah breathe , ` ` did you … ? '' \\n▁ his head tilted down to look at her and she was staring at him , lips parted , eyes wide , faced filled with wonder . \\n▁ his favorite look . \\n▁ a look he had n't seen in three weeks , a look he did n't realize how much he missed until that very moment . \\n▁ she went on , ` ` did you just mind control justin ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' lucien replied without hesitation wondering what her reaction would be . \\n▁ if he 'd been asked , he would have guessed a variety of things . \\n▁ none of which was what he received . \\n▁ she burst out laughing . \\n▁ laughing . \\n▁ she threw her head back , exposing the elegant line of her throat , her face lit with mirth , her entire body shaking with it . \\n▁ he 'd never made her laugh . \\n▁ not once . \\n▁ in eight hundred years there were a great number of things he 'd done but at that moment none of them seemed as monumental as making leah laugh . \\n▁ she curled into his front . \\n▁ one arm was still holding him tight around the waist , her other hand still clenched at his lapel . \\n▁ the rest of her body collapsed into him as if the weight of her hilarity was too much to bear . \\n▁ she bent her neck and rested her forehead against his chest , still giggling . \\n▁ ` ` you … you … mind - controlled justin , '' she stammered through her giggles into his chest then her head snapped back and she cried with very loud glee , ` ` justin ! '' \\n▁ lucien felt stephanie 's gaze . \\n▁ he glanced at her to see her brows raised , a smile playing at her mouth . \\n▁ he looked back down at leah and made a decision . \\n▁ half - leading , half - dragging her still giggling frame , he guided her to the far less crowded hall that led to the restrooms . \\n▁ there , he pressed her into the wall and got close . \\n▁ she put her hands on his chest and smiled up at him . \\n▁ lucien felt his chest get tight . \\n▁ this feeling was n't unpleasant in the slightest . \\n▁ ` ` that 's usually justin 's gig , '' she said through her smile . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked , smiling back , his arms sliding around her waist to pull her closer even as he leaned into her , pressing her back into the wall . \\n▁ ` ` mind control . \\n▁ justin was the master . '' \\n▁ then she laughed again , out loud , her body sagging into his . \\n▁ when she controlled herself she told him , ` ` if i 'd have known you six months ago , i would have paid you to mind control justin . \\n▁ he was such a shit , the master manipulator . '' \\n▁ ` ` you would n't have had to pay me , my pet . \\n▁ it would have been my pleasure . '' \\n▁ he was still smiling but his words were serious . \\n▁ they also sobered her . \\n▁ her body twitched and the smile died on her face . \\n▁ lucien wanted it back . \\n▁ ` ` do n't , '' he warned , his arms tightening . \\n▁ she looked around , noticing for the first time where she was . \\n▁ then her eyes locked at the entryway five feet down the hall . \\n▁ ` ` we should get back to stephanie - '' ` ` look at me , leah . '' \\n▁ for the first time in weeks he watched her struggling against her natural reaction before her eyes met his . \\n▁ ` ` for five minutes , i had you back . \\n▁ do n't go away again , '' he demanded . \\n▁ ` ` but you already - '' she started and he cut her off . \\n▁ ` ` if you tell me i ' ve already got you , i swear to christ , we 're going home right now and i 'll do whatever i have to do to drag you out of that f * * king fortress you ' ve built around you . '' \\n▁ her mouth clamped shut , her eyes flashed and lucien felt a bolt of elation rip through him . \\n▁ finally , he was getting somewhere . \\n▁ ` ` can we talk about this later ? '' \\n▁ she asked quietly . \\n▁ ` ` there 's nothing to talk about , '' he told her . \\n▁ ` ` you 're withholding from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` am not , '' she returned . \\n▁ ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ her name was a warning . \\n▁ ` ` well , i ' m not ! '' \\n▁ her voice was rising and lucien welcomed it . \\n▁ because of this , his tone softened when he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` you forget , sweetling , i ' ve been watching you for twenty years . '' \\n▁ her eyes slid away and she muttered , ` ` i have n't forgotten that . '' \\n▁ his arms gave her a squeeze and her gaze came back to his . \\n▁ ` ` therefore , i know the leah buchanan who i ' m sharing a bed with is not leah buchanan . '' \\n▁ ` ` she is , '' leah retorted . \\n▁ stubborn . \\n▁ he nearly smiled . \\n▁ he did n't . \\n▁ ` ` she is n't , '' he replied . \\n▁ ` ` what do you want from me ? '' \\n▁ she asked and there was the barest hint of a snap to her question . \\n▁ regardless of her crumbling composure , he could hear her heart racing and he could smell her fear . \\n▁ he 'd missed that too . \\n▁ he drew her even closer and her hands on his chest started pressing . \\n▁ he ignored it . \\n▁ ` ` everything , '' he answered . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve got it . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` whatever you do n't have then you ca n't have . '' \\n▁ definitely a snap . \\n▁ yes , his leah was coming back . \\n▁ he could n't help it , he smiled . \\n▁ her eyes dropped to his mouth and he heard her pulse accelerate . \\n▁ ` ` you 're saying you 're determined to be nothing but my whore , '' he stated . \\n▁ her body grew still and her heart skipped . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you have a choice . \\n▁ you can be with me as i want you to be or you can be my whore . \\n▁ your choice . '' \\n▁ he watched her face work as she struggled to find a way out of the predicament she placed herself in . \\n▁ then she said , ` ` there 's a third choice . '' \\n▁ ` ` and that would be ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you can release me . '' \\n▁ he felt his chest tighten again . \\n▁ this time it was extremely unpleasant . \\n▁ ` ` that is n't going to happen . '' \\n▁ she pushed against him . \\n▁ he ignored it . \\n▁ ` ` i refuse to choose , '' she hissed . \\n▁ ` ` then i 'll choose . '' \\n▁ she stopped breathing and her face went pale before she whispered , ` ` you ca n't make me do either one . '' \\n▁ his hand slid up her back , fingers wrapping around her neck . \\n▁ ` ` would you like to try me , pet ? '' \\n▁ her fear spiked , the scent of it filling the hall and he felt his c * * k start to get hard in reaction as he felt her heart tripping against his chest . \\n▁ the bells sounded , announcing it was time for the patrons to take their seats . \\n▁ ` ` please can we talk about this later ? '' \\n▁ she begged and he studied her face . \\n▁ she 'd had enough . \\n▁ however , he was again getting through . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he relented . \\n▁ ` ` we can talk about it later . '' \\n▁ she sagged in relief against him . \\n▁ he dipped his face to touch his mouth to hers . \\n▁ ` ` but we will talk about it , leah , '' he cautioned , his lips moving against hers . \\n▁ ` ` your new game ends and we begin . '' \\n▁ he watched close up as her eyes grew round , her scent enveloping him , her delicious fear coating his throat . \\n▁ ` ` tonight , '' he finished . \\n▁ * * * * * leah sat beside him in the car , feigning sleep . \\n▁ he knew she was n't asleep . \\n▁ he 'd slept a month of nights beside her . \\n▁ he knew exactly what her breathing and heart sounded like when she was sleeping . \\n▁ that was not it . \\n▁ furthermore , she could n't be tired considering she 'd had a nap at the opera . \\n▁ it was safe to say , even though leah had n't told him , she did n't like opera . \\n▁ during the first act , he 'd discovered this when he felt her subtle movements beside him . \\n▁ however when he turned his head to look at her , her own head was bowed as if deep in contemplation . \\n▁ he thought nothing of this , suspecting she was considering her options for their discussion later that evening . \\n▁ his gaze moved to stephanie who was sitting beside leah , eyes glued on the stage , lips curved into an amused grin . \\n▁ they were n't watching a comedy . \\n▁ his gaze traveled back to leah and he saw her suddenly pull an outrageous face . \\n▁ chin jutted out so the cords in her neck strained , she flicked her tongue between her lips like a snake . \\n▁ lucien stared in disbelief wondering if the pressure of his taming was getting to her . \\n▁ then he heard a child 's giggle . \\n▁ he looked down over the balcony railing and saw a little girl no more than six who was completely uninterested in the opera . \\n▁ she was staring up at leah , her face wreathed in smiles . \\n▁ after a moment she mimicked leah 's snake face and then rearranged her features , using her thumbs to pull out her mouth and her fingers to pull down her eyes . \\n▁ lucien looked back at leah , who 'd bugged out her eyes comically wide and was shaking her head in a subtle ` ` no '' . \\n▁ the child giggled again , practically jumping up in her seat , making motions with her hands that leah was to follow her lead something that had , apparently , been going on for some time . \\n▁ her mother , sitting beside her , finally noticed her daughter 's behavior and lucien heard the mother 's hushed rebuke . \\n▁ his arm moved around leah 's shoulders , she jumped and her head turned to him . \\n▁ he caught a look on her face that nearly made him roar with laughter . \\n▁ she looked exactly like the six year old below who 'd just been caught and scolded . \\n▁ he sought her ear with his mouth and whispered , ` ` be good . '' \\n▁ he felt her shoulders tense under his arm but ignored it , pulling her into his side which she resisted pointlessly . \\n▁ his eyes moved to stephanie who was watching them , smiling broadly now before he tucked leah firmly in his side and glanced back at the stage . \\n▁ he , too , was smiling . \\n▁ she managed to curtail her antics for the rest of the first act and chatted amicably if pensively with stephanie during intermission . \\n▁ the second act , he positioned her as he had the first and she promptly fell asleep with her head against his shoulder . \\n▁ and that nap had not been feigned . \\n▁ she had been out , the entirety of her weight resting against him . \\n▁ although he wished she 'd told him she did n't like opera , he could n't say he minded her sleeping with her head on his shoulder where he could tug a tendril of her hair free and twirl its silkiness around his finger something he found that night he could do for hours . \\n▁ his thoughts still on that tendril , lucien saw they were home . \\n▁ he hit the garage door opener and parked the porsche next to the cayenne . \\n▁ he was out of the car over to her side with her door open when she pretended to wake . \\n▁ ` ` we 're home ? '' \\n▁ she asked in a false drowsy voice . \\n▁ lucien bit back a smile . \\n▁ ` ` yes , pet . '' \\n▁ he helped her out and she started to wander sleepily to the door to the kitchen . \\n▁ he caught her and slid an arm along her shoulders , pulling her close and guiding her the rest of the way . \\n▁ ` ` tired ? '' \\n▁ he asked with sham xxunk as he halted them by the door so he could hang his keys on the hook on the kitchen wall . \\n▁ she faked a yawn . \\n▁ then she answered , ` ` definitely . '' \\n▁ ` ` let 's get you to bed , '' he murmured and she nodded . \\n▁ he walked with her close to his side all the way to the bedroom where she pulled away . \\n▁ he moved to turn on the bedside light and she sat on the bed , bending double , her hands moving to the straps of her shoe . \\n▁ he shrugged off his suit jacket and walked to the chaise . \\n▁ ` ` i take it you are n't fond of opera ? '' \\n▁ he asked , throwing his jacket on the chaise and sitting to take off his own shoes . \\n▁ ` ` um … '' she hesitated , sliding her shoe off her foot , setting it aside and then going after the straps of the other one , ` ` no . '' \\n▁ pleased she had n't attempted to lie in order to tell him what she thought he would want to hear , lucien stood and unbuttoned his shirt . \\n▁ ` ` i think i got that . '' \\n▁ she rose from the bed without a reply or even looking at him and started toward the dressing room . \\n▁ using his natural speed , he slid off his shirt , dropped it on the chaise and was at her side before she walked three steps . \\n▁ his hand caught hers , she quaked to a stop and looked up at him . \\n▁ ` ` where are you going ? '' \\n▁ he queried . \\n▁ ` ` to take off my dress and put on my pajamas , '' she answered . \\n▁ ` ` no pajamas , '' lucien replied , her eyes grew wide and he turned her so her back was facing him before he continued . \\n▁ ` ` i want to feel you against me tonight , pet . '' \\n▁ her body turned to stone as his fingers went to her zipper but she did n't resist . \\n▁ he slid it down and she stood ramrod straight . \\n▁ the material parted and then fell away . \\n▁ she was wearing nothing but a pair of sheer lavender - colored panties edged in the same colored lace . \\n▁ her hands went up to shield her br * * sts as he turned her again and pulled her to him , her arms caught between their bodies . \\n▁ ` ` take off my trousers , '' he ordered , his fingers drifting up the soft skin of her na * * d back . \\n▁ she blinked . \\n▁ then she asked , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ his fingers found a butterfly clip in her hair . \\n▁ he squeezed the wings gently and pulled it out . \\n▁ then he repeated , ` ` leah , take off my trousers . \\n▁ she hesitated a moment then , xxunk , her hands went to his belt . \\n▁ his fingers found another clip and he carefully pulled it out . \\n▁ ` ` so , i take it you ' ve decided ? '' \\n▁ she whispered , his belt undone , she moved to the fastening . \\n▁ ` ` decided what ? '' \\n▁ he asked , taking out another butterfly and watching , with no small amount of fascination , as her shining hair slowly tumbled to her shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` that i ' m to be your whore . '' \\n▁ so deep in his study of her hair he was startled by her words and his eyes moved from her hair to hers . \\n▁ ` ` why would you say that ? '' \\n▁ she slid his zipper down . \\n▁ this , evidently , was her answer . \\n▁ with one hand , he found more clips and also bobby pins which he pulled out as well . \\n▁ the other hand he wrapped around the back of her neck . \\n▁ he did n't take his eyes from hers . \\n▁ ` ` lovers disrobe each other , leah , '' he said softly . \\n▁ he heard her heart bump unevenly , she tore her eyes from his , looking at his shoulder as she slid her hands along his waist and tugged his pants down . \\n▁ they barely hit the floor before he stepped out of them , had her cradled in his arms and at the side of the bed . \\n▁ he yanked back the covers , depositing her in it . \\n▁ he dropped her hair bobs on her bedside table , moved over her and settled at her side . \\n▁ ` ` sit up and turn your back to me , '' he demanded , she hesitated again before she complied , bringing the covers up to her chest as she did so . \\n▁ his hands went back to her hair . \\n▁ ` ` how many pins do you have in here , sweetling ? '' \\n▁ he muttered as all the butterflies were out but there seemed hundreds of pins still in . \\n▁ ` ` i have a lot of hair , '' she whispered . \\n▁ he stopped pulling out pins , his hand moving to her neck , across her throat , and down . \\n▁ he curled his fingers around her upper arm and pulled her back to his chest , his face buried in her thick , soft , now wildly wavy hair . \\n▁ ` ` mm , '' he murmured into the locks , ` ` that you do . '' \\n▁ her hands came up , fingers sliding into her hair . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll finish it . '' \\n▁ he pulled back , letting her go and pushed her hands away . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll do it . '' \\n▁ she blindly batted at his hands . \\n▁ ` ` it wo n't take me a second . '' \\n▁ ` ` i said i 'll do it . '' \\n▁ ` ` really - '' he leaned in deep , taking her with him and dumping the pins and clips on the nightstand . \\n▁ then he caught her wrists in a tight hold and pulled them around , crossing them at her front . \\n▁ against her ear he repeated firmly , ` ` i 'll do it . '' \\n▁ she stiffened a second before her body went slack . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she whispered . \\n▁ she pulled the covers up to hide herself and then sat still as he finished with the pins . \\n▁ after some time his fingers slid through her hair , searching for any pins he 'd left behind . \\n▁ finding none , he deposited the last of them with the others . \\n▁ his hands going back to her hair , he gathered it all in his fists . \\n▁ transferring it to one , he pulled it aside and kissed her bare shoulder . \\n▁ she trembled against his lips . \\n▁ he smiled against her skin . \\n▁ ` ` can i go to sleep now ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he answered . \\n▁ her body jerked and she twisted her head to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` but i ' m tired , '' she lied . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i know . '' \\n▁ he tried not to grin . \\n▁ ` ` you said we could go to bed . '' \\n▁ her tone held a mild accusation . \\n▁ ` ` we 're in bed , '' he pointed out . \\n▁ ` ` i thought you meant to sleep , '' she told him . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' she started but did n't finish . \\n▁ he moved her to face him , tugging the covers out of her hands at the same time lifting up to lean his back against the headboard and pressing her torso to his side . \\n▁ ` ` we 're going to talk , '' he announced . \\n▁ she tilted her head back to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m really tired , lucien . \\n▁ really tired . '' \\n▁ she stressed the words vocally and by pressing her soft body deeper into his . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think i have it in me to talk . '' \\n▁ his hand came up to cup her jaw . \\n▁ ` ` that 's fine , sweetheart , you are n't going to be talking . '' \\n▁ her body grew tense . \\n▁ ` ` it 's been some time since you ' ve had a lesson , '' he told her and saw surprise slide across her features . \\n▁ he watched her struggle with her reaction . \\n▁ then he watched her lose . \\n▁ ` ` have you come to a decision ? '' \\n▁ she asked , her voice edging toward a demand . \\n▁ ` ` about what ? '' \\n▁ he heard her teeth grinding and controlled his laughter . \\n▁ barely . \\n▁ ` ` earlier tonight , you said you were going to choose , '' she reminded him . \\n▁ ` ` have you come to your decision ? '' \\n▁ as much as he was enjoying this , lucien let her off the hook . \\n▁ ` ` that 's what your lesson is about . '' \\n▁ he watched her face working again , heard her teeth grinding again before he felt her weight settle into his side . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m all ears , '' she muttered , now her voice held mild irritation . \\n▁ his hand at her jaw slid into the side of her hair and he pressed her cheek against his chest . \\n▁ he then took her wrist , pulling it across his abdomen , resting her arm there . \\n▁ finally , he placed his hand on her neck , thumb stroking her throat . \\n▁ ` ` did you learn anything about the history of concubines while in class ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ her felt her head move indicating a negative against his chest . \\n▁ of course she did n't . \\n▁ lucien smiled over her head and continued , ` ` the role of official concubine started just after the revolution when mortal and immortal representatives met to negotiate the agreement which would dictate how the two cultures would co - exist . \\n▁ eleven elders , or oldest living vampires , represented our culture . \\n▁ ambassadors from eleven european countries represented yours . \\n▁ for mortals , the primary concern was to stop hunting . \\n▁ for immortals , the primary concern was to ensure safe feeding but also to find a way that vampires could feed and still have a place in society not in shadows . \\n▁ as i told you before , many vampires already had what amounted to concubines , women who shared their blood willingly . \\n▁ it was agreed that this would be the practice from that point on . \\n▁ the agreement was written and both immortals and mortals signed it . '' \\n▁ lucien paused and leah nodded that she understood and he should carry on which he did . \\n▁ ` ` concubines were recruited from the highest - born families in europe , aristocrats , the daughters of wealthy merchants even some lower - born royals . \\n▁ this was facilitated secretly by command of monarchs across europe . \\n▁ it was n't essential that the women came willing . \\n▁ most often they were sold into the life . '' \\n▁ he heard her take in a sharp breath and his hand at her neck gave her a reassuring squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` they might have been sold into the life , leah , but once there not one attempted to leave it . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she whispered when he paused again for her to give indication that she accepted this fact . \\n▁ ` ` the first family to come forward and sign the agreement was yours , '' he told her and added , ` ` the xxunk came willingly . '' \\n▁ ` ` i knew that , '' she said softly . \\n▁ ` ` did you know that they 'd already been concubines for five generations ? '' \\n▁ her head tilted back and he met her gaze . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't know that , '' she replied softly . \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` not only concubines to vampires but concubines to kings . '' \\n▁ he watched her face pale , felt her body get tight and she pushed up and away . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' she breathed , so appalled for once she forgot her own nudity . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' expression still horrified , she talked over him . \\n▁ ` ` i come from a family of whores . '' \\n▁ his arms curved around her and he pulled her up his chest so they were face - to - face . \\n▁ ` ` you must remember , those times were different , '' he warned , locking eyes with her . \\n▁ ` ` and the buchanan women were different . \\n▁ they wanted something else from life . \\n▁ strong women could n't live their own lives back then , no women could . \\n▁ your ancestors did what they had to do to guarantee themselves a certain amount of freedom , freedom that included safety and comfort and they did n't care what people thought . \\n▁ these are traits to admire , then and now . '' \\n▁ she continued to look horrified and dubious so he went on , ` ` i knew your buchanan ancestors , pet , they made their own way without men ruling their lives . \\n▁ you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of . '' \\n▁ his voice dipped low . \\n▁ ` ` and they would have liked you , particularly you . \\n▁ you remind me of them , leah . '' \\n▁ she wrinkled her nose and lucien thought it made her look adorable so he smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m giving you a compliment , '' he informed her . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she agreed without actually agreeing , clearly wanting to be off the subject . \\n▁ he disregarded her nonverbal cue . \\n▁ ` ` they ensured , for centuries , that all of their line would live safe and well , even you . \\n▁ and i do n't mean now with me , i mean your whole life as provided by your mother . '' \\n▁ ` ` seems to me men provided that life or at least vampires did . \\n▁ in our case , cosmo took care of us . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but for seven years your mother took care of cosmo . '' \\n▁ she made a noise that sounded like a snort . \\n▁ he gave her an impatient squeeze but softened his voice . \\n▁ ` ` what your family does is no small thing . \\n▁ without your blood , your mother 's , your entire line and all those like you , given willingly , we would need to hunt . '' \\n▁ he watched as understanding dawned then her brows drew together and she replied , ` ` all those people at the feasts , wats and breed … you would n't go hungry and you would n't need to hunt . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're correct , '' he allowed . \\n▁ ` ` but survival feeding is very different than partaking of an elegant repast . \\n▁ the vampires who remained after the revolution as a whole crave the finer things in life . \\n▁ you saw them , leah . \\n▁ wats and breed are not the finer things in life . \\n▁ concubines definitely are . \\n▁ to find that , if not given willingly , we 'd hunt . '' \\n▁ her eyes moved from his and she muttered , ` ` snooty . '' \\n▁ ` ` look at me , pet , '' he demanded and when she did he went on . \\n▁ ` ` that is n't it , there 's more . \\n▁ you said three weeks ago that there were not many people i could be myself with and you 're one . \\n▁ do you have any idea what it 's like , second - to - second for centuries , hiding who you are to live in the mortal 's world ? '' \\n▁ she squirmed uncomfortably against him and he stilled her with another arm squeeze . \\n▁ she seemed to be searching for an argument , found one and retorted , ` ` lucien , you can totally be yourself at feasts and around wats and breed . \\n▁ they 'd love it . \\n▁ they 'd do anything for you to be you . \\n▁ they live for it . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's different . '' \\n▁ ` ` how ? '' \\n▁ lucien sighed before explaining , ` ` they do n't want me to be me . \\n▁ they want me to be whatever their twisted notion is of a vampire , superhuman creature of the night , romanticized or xxunk in their minds . \\n▁ they think they 're playing with fire or living a novel . \\n▁ they do n't accept me for being what i am . \\n▁ they 're takers , users , all of them . \\n▁ you see it as them giving me something but it 's not , they 're taking . \\n▁ i may be feeding off their blood but they 're feeding as well . \\n▁ what i do is natural , giving my body what it needs . \\n▁ what they do is selfish and greedy . \\n▁ not once from the likes of breed and wats or anyone at a feast have i ever met a single mortal soul who knows what i am who 's given one whit about me . \\n▁ asked me about my day . \\n▁ wondered aloud at my mood . \\n▁ wished to discuss a book . \\n▁ five hundred years , leah , and not once . \\n▁ i ' m not human to them . \\n▁ i do n't exist outside whatever fantasy they ' ve created about me . \\n▁ i ' m their tool to manipulate to an orgasm or whatever the f * * k they get from me . '' \\n▁ as he spoke he noticed her face soften before sorrow filled her gaze . \\n▁ sorrow mixed with tenderness , a look so bleak yet intensely compassionate , it shook him . \\n▁ her hand drifted up his chest , lifted and he held his breath because he thought she was actually going to touch his face in an act of affection . \\n▁ instead , disappointingly , she thought better of it and her hand floated down to rest lightly on his shoulder . \\n▁ regardless of his disappointment , his fingers captured a lock of her hair and started twisting ` ` concubines are n't like that , '' he continued quietly when she made no reply . \\n▁ ` ` concubines understand and accept who we are , what we need and they give us more . \\n▁ not just blood . \\n▁ a safe harbor where we can be who we are . \\n▁ you , '' his voice dropped to a whisper and his face moved closer to hers , ` ` are part of my life , my real life , not some romance novel or horror film . \\n▁ this is a relationship , sweetling , one in my world as it is today that is essential to me . \\n▁ without it , i 'd go mad . '' \\n▁ the sorrow left her gaze , the compassion remained and he felt her body melt into his . \\n▁ thank f * * king god . \\n▁ finally , he was getting somewhere . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' she murmured . \\n▁ he did n't let her continue , feeling the time was ripe to make his point . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want a whore , leah . \\n▁ i want you to accept who i am and what we are to each other . '' \\n▁ ` ` i accept you , '' she whispered and the way she did it he believed her . \\n▁ without hesitation he asked , ` ` do you accept what we are to each other ? '' \\n▁ she bit her lip in indecision . \\n▁ ` ` do you ? '' \\n▁ he pressed . \\n▁ ` ` what , um , '' she paused then went on , ` ` exactly are we to each other ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'd like us to be lovers . '' \\n▁ oddly , her eyes turned hopeful . \\n▁ ` ` lovers ? '' \\n▁ not certain of the reasons behind her hope , he replied cautiously , ` ` lovers . '' \\n▁ ` ` just lovers ? '' \\n▁ she repeated . \\n▁ his sense of caution escalated . \\n▁ ` ` perhaps you should describe to me what ` just lovers ' means . '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps you should describe to me what you think ` lovers ' means . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve made that clear , '' he told her . \\n▁ ` ` you want me to trust you . '' \\n▁ ` ` that and more . '' \\n▁ her pliant body stiffened . \\n▁ ` ` what else ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ he studied her for a moment wondering if she was genuinely obtuse or stubbornly so . \\n▁ he decided the latter . \\n▁ he also thought that perhaps he actually was n't getting somewhere . \\n▁ with waning patience , he explained , ` ` leah , my clothes are in your closet . \\n▁ my body is in your bed . \\n▁ i come home to you every night . '' \\n▁ her reply was swift . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , your clothes are in your closet . \\n▁ your body is in your bed . \\n▁ you come home to your house every night . '' \\n▁ he felt his brows draw together . \\n▁ ` ` this is your house , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're wrong , '' she returned . \\n▁ ` ` this is the house you provided for me to live in while all this is going on . '' \\n▁ his eyes narrowed under his drawn brows and his patience slipped another notch . \\n▁ ` ` you 're correct , i was wrong . \\n▁ this is n't your house . \\n▁ and you 're also wrong . \\n▁ this is n't the house i provided for you ` while all this is going on ' . '' \\n▁ when she spoke , he sensed her patience was slipping too . \\n▁ ` ` then what is it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's our house . '' \\n▁ her body jerked and she pulled reflexively against his arms . \\n▁ he held her tightly , not giving her an inch . \\n▁ ` ` there is no ` our ' , '' she snapped , her hand at his shoulder pressing to no avail . \\n▁ still , she did n't stop . \\n▁ ` ` there will be , '' he declared decisively and he saw her eyes flash before they filled with anger . \\n▁ she pressed harder while muttering irately , ` ` lucien , let me go . '' \\n▁ no , he was definitely not getting somewhere . \\n▁ at her attempt to retreat , his patience took another hit . \\n▁ ` ` what the f * * k do you think this is all about ? '' \\n▁ he ground out . \\n▁ she locked eyes with him and demanded , ` ` let me go . '' \\n▁ ` ` answer me . '' \\n▁ she did n't . \\n▁ instead , she asked her own question . \\n▁ ` ` is this what taming is ? '' \\n▁ her voice was rising . \\n▁ ` ` creating an ` our ' which means you 'd be creating an ` us ' ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , that 's part of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` it sure has a lot of parts , '' she retorted sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` yes , it f * * king well does and if you 'd stop being so goddamned stubborn , you might open yourself up to learning them all and understand how beautiful it is . '' \\n▁ ` ` right , '' she shot back derisively . \\n▁ his arms gave her a gentle shake . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't have any idea what you 're treating with such scorn . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh yes i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` explain it to me then . '' \\n▁ she stilled and to his surprise , agreed . \\n▁ ` ` all right , i will . '' \\n▁ he held her defiant glare before muttering , ` ` this will be interesting . '' \\n▁ she shot him a look that would have been amusing if he was n't so annoyed . \\n▁ then she spoke , clipping out every word . \\n▁ ` ` beautiful house . \\n▁ beautiful clothes . \\n▁ beautiful path that leads down to a beautiful lake . \\n▁ beautiful pool . \\n▁ ritzy neighborhood . \\n▁ going to the opera with gold butterflies in her hair . \\n▁ a housekeeper who xxunk her clothes and makes her breakfast . \\n▁ hot , superhuman vampire with a great body who 's good with his hands , not to mention his mouth , coming home to her every night . \\n▁ a girl could get used to that . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's the point , '' he returned . \\n▁ ` ` okay then , what happens when you 're through with me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's common practice for other vampires , including myself , to move their concubines into less lavish accommodation after the arrangement is finished . \\n▁ but , if you 'd have given me five minutes to explain in the last month , you would know that , given the taming , this is your life until you die . '' \\n▁ lucien thought that was rather substantial . \\n▁ leah disagreed . \\n▁ ` ` thanks , lucien , '' she snapped back sarcastically . \\n▁ ` ` that takes a load off . '' \\n▁ he gave her another shake , this one far less gentle . \\n▁ ` ` explain yourself . '' \\n▁ she gave him another look , this one far less amusing . \\n▁ she also started trying to pull away again but he held her close . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't think i care to , '' she stated . \\n▁ ` ` let me see if i understand you , my pet . \\n▁ what i told you tonight is that you 're an important part of my life , meaningful to me . \\n▁ i intend to live with you , share my life with you , take you as my lover , something you want as badly as me and do n't f * * king deny it , and provide you with supremely comfortable life until you die and you 're throwing that in my face ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yep , '' she returned instantly now irritatingly glib . \\n▁ ` ` that 's exactly what i ' m saying . \\n▁ i do n't want any of this . '' \\n▁ she threw an arm out , encompassing the room before it went back to push against his chest . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want any of what you said . \\n▁ and most of all , i do n't want you . '' \\n▁ his patience fled , anger replacing it . \\n▁ a great deal of anger . \\n▁ he yanked her over his body so they were chest - to - chest . \\n▁ his voice was low and cold when he replied , ` ` i ' ve an urge to call you on that last lie . '' \\n▁ he could see her anger was escalating at the same pace as his . \\n▁ therefore she ignored his threat and demanded , ` ` release me . '' \\n▁ his arms grew tighter . \\n▁ ` ` not until you ' ve learned tonight 's lesson , my pet . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't mean now ! '' \\n▁ she snapped . \\n▁ ` ` i mean completely . \\n▁ release me from our arrangement . \\n▁ find someone else 's head to mess with . '' \\n▁ her words roaring through him , leaving behind that twisting , vile feeling he despised , he sat up suddenly and to accommodate him she was forced to straddle his lap . \\n▁ she gasped in shocked surprise then tried to pull away . \\n▁ ` ` stop struggling , '' he demanded , his arm locking around her waist , his other hand fisting in her hair . \\n▁ ` ` release me , '' she shot back . \\n▁ ` ` that 's not going to happen , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` you want me to give you everything . \\n▁ my trust , my body , my time and you think i should be grateful because of some pretty clothes and a f * * king great house ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you missed some things , '' he returned . \\n▁ ` ` oh yes , my blood , '' she clipped . \\n▁ ` ` yes , your blood and a great deal more . '' \\n▁ she stopped struggling against his hold and her angry face got close to his . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i get that lucien . '' \\n▁ her voice was an enraged whisper . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't say it but i know what you want . \\n▁ and you ca n't have it because i know , eventually , you 're going to throw it away . \\n▁ therefore , it does n't mean one f * * king thing to you , no matter how you pretty up the words . \\n▁ so i ' m keeping it . '' \\n▁ involuntarily , his arms tensed , he knew it was too much and he did n't care . \\n▁ he felt her pulse soar as her breath went out of her . \\n▁ ` ` how can you say that ? '' \\n▁ he hissed . \\n▁ breathing with difficulty , she went back to her earlier theme . \\n▁ ` ` release me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve been waiting for you for twenty f * * king years , '' he reminded her . \\n▁ ` ` do n't worry , lucien . '' \\n▁ her tone was cutting . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sure another sweet - smelling pu * * y will happen along . '' \\n▁ controlling his fury by a very weak thread , he twisted . \\n▁ she landed on her back , him on top , his h * ps between her legs . \\n▁ ` ` you have n't listened or paid any attention to a f * * king thing i ' ve said or done , '' he grated . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't missed one freaking thing ! '' \\n▁ she shouted in his face . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve missed everything . \\n▁ so i 'll say it so you can understand it . \\n▁ i ' ve been waiting to have you since i knew you existed . \\n▁ but i ' ve been waiting for someone like you for five f * * king centuries . '' \\n▁ ` ` i doubt the earth is going to crash into the sun anytime soon . \\n▁ you 'll get another chance . '' \\n▁ good christ she was stubborn . \\n▁ he growled . \\n▁ ` ` release me , '' she demanded . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` release me ! '' \\n▁ she yelled . \\n▁ ` ` never ! '' \\n▁ he shouted back . \\n▁ his last word made her face change . \\n▁ it twisted , contorting in a look of pain so raw , so severe , it caught him off guard and translated into a kindred slash of pain through his gut that was so intense he felt instant nausea . \\n▁ which meant her fist connecting with his jaw came as a surprise . \\n▁ his head wrenched to the side on contact and he stayed that way , looking unseeing across the room . \\n▁ it did n't hurt . \\n▁ she was a female mortal in a xxunk position on her back with him close . \\n▁ but he was a vampire . \\n▁ and concubines were meant to respect vampires . \\n▁ he gave her her head in many things because he knew what he 'd bought into when he 'd selected her . \\n▁ but she had just crossed the line . \\n▁ slowly , his head turned back to her . \\n▁ she was panting , her heart racing , rampant fear in her scent but obstinacy and rage was in her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` you struck me , '' he said , his voice deceptively soft . \\n▁ she ignored the danger in his tone , bucked and demanded , ` ` get off me ! '' \\n▁ he did as she asked but only to sit at the side of the bed , pulling her roughly into his lap and locking her to his body with his arms . \\n▁ she struggled . \\n▁ ` ` let me go ! '' \\n▁ he shook her with enough force to get her attention . \\n▁ she stopped struggling , her eyes jerked to his and he heard her heart spike as her breath caught . \\n▁ ` ` right now , leah , you 're going to learn to respect me , '' he whispered . \\n▁ she opened her mouth to speak but he moved her so quickly whatever words she had died in her throat . \\n▁ he twisted her so she was facedown on the bed , her h * ps in his lap , ass pointed to the ceiling . \\n▁ she read his intent and reared up , screaming with terrified fury , ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ silence , he commanded , her vocal denials stopped instantly but she kept fighting . \\n▁ he thought it prudent to allow her struggles . \\n▁ she 'd not thank him for this after and commanding her acquiescence through controlling her mind , he surmised , would be a tactical error . \\n▁ silencing her cries was enough . \\n▁ he had enough of a battle on his hands , clearly not making any advances in the slightest , even after a head - to - head week followed by three of detente . \\n▁ he did n't need her sincerely hating him instead of telling herself she did . \\n▁ he positioned one thigh over both hers and held her down to the bed with his hand in her back . \\n▁ she pressed , pushed and bucked but he did n't allow her to make any progress toward freeing herself . \\n▁ then his hand came down on her ass , sharply enough to make his point not enough to cause any real pain . \\n▁ the instant the crack of his hand against her skin filled the room , she stilled completely . \\n▁ he did this three more times . \\n▁ each strike , her body jerked in response but she did n't fight . \\n▁ the next time his hand went to her ass , it was not to strike but to soothe . \\n▁ ` ` do you get my point ? '' \\n▁ he asked quietly , his hand moving gently over her bottom , his gaze moving toward her head . \\n▁ her face was buried in the comforter , her hair splayed around her shoulders , arms stretched out before her , fingers curled into a pillow . \\n▁ he watched her nod . \\n▁ now it was time to teach her another lesson . \\n▁ his thigh lifted and as he suspected she 'd do , she immediately sought escape . \\n▁ moving her legs just enough to open them , his thigh descended , trapping her now - parted ones . \\n▁ he watched her head jerk back and her fingers fist into the pillow . \\n▁ he tugged down her panties , exposing her . \\n▁ no , her mind called out to him . \\n▁ yes , sweetling , he replied . \\n▁ as his hand moved between her legs , she tried struggling but he held her down . \\n▁ she kept struggling as he worked her and with a swiftness that gratified him but likely mortified her , she grew wet . \\n▁ he continued working her until she dripped . \\n▁ her movements turned from fighting to squirming , her h * ps lifting , her legs moving under his thigh , not for escape but to move further apart to give him more access . \\n▁ he allowed this and carried on , her movements , the feel of her , wet and silken , and her scent making his c * * k grow hard and start aching . \\n▁ with better access and weeks between orgasms her movements quickly became urgent . \\n▁ when he knew she was close , he lifted his thigh , pulled her out from beneath it and swept her panties from her legs . \\n▁ then he tugged her up and settled her straddling his lap . \\n▁ her arms immediately circled his shoulders , one hand fisting in his hair , her forehead dropping to his shoulder . \\n▁ her h * ps moved , seeking his c * * k which he withheld . \\n▁ considering she 'd latched onto him it was unnecessary that he hold her captive with his arm around her waist but he did so . \\n▁ he also pressed a hand between her legs , stroking , teasing , circling , fueling the burn but not enough to relieve it . \\n▁ he released her from her silence . \\n▁ she felt it instantly and whispered with deep feeling , ` ` i really hate you . '' \\n▁ he buried his face in her neck to hide his smile . \\n▁ even his very stubborn leah could n't hate him at the same time her body moved in desperation to join with his . \\n▁ his hand drifted up her back as he rubbed himself against her . \\n▁ ` ` do you ever wonder at the intensity of your feeling for me , pet ? '' \\n▁ he asked her neck . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she snapped back but her voice was breathy and her head moved back to expose more of her throat , inviting his lips , tongue or teeth , it was clearly his choice . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a big , fat , vampire jerk . '' \\n▁ he decided to ignore her words . \\n▁ ` ` do you want me to feed or do you want my cock ? '' \\n▁ he paused , pressing against her . \\n▁ ` ` or both ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i hate you , '' she whispered instead of answering . \\n▁ his hand moved from her waist to her breast , his thumb brushing her rock - hard nipple . \\n▁ she caught her breath and her heart skipped a beat . \\n▁ she bucked against his hand between her legs and he smelled her rush of wetness even as he felt it . \\n▁ god , she was magnificent . \\n▁ if he ever lost sight of why he was enduring this torture , he only had to remember that moment . \\n▁ or the one where she melted against him with tenderness in her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` answer me , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` both , '' she breathed , her tone managing to be somehow defiant and defeated . \\n▁ tonight , he decided , leah would get what she wanted . \\n▁ and , finally , so would he . \\n▁ he moved , shifting her to her back , his h * ps between her legs , hers rising instantly in invitation . \\n▁ his mouth went to hers as he pressed the tip of his c * * k inside her . \\n▁ tight and saturated . \\n▁ he could n't f * * king wait to be seated to the hilt inside . \\n▁ however , before he finally gave them what they both wanted , they needed to get one thing straight . \\n▁ his eyes locked with hers . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll not release you , '' he growled . \\n▁ ` ` do n't mention it again . '' \\n▁ she moved her h * ps against his , seeking deeper contact but did n't answer . \\n▁ ` ` do you understand me ? '' \\n▁ he pushed . \\n▁ she glared at him even as her h * ps pressed down . \\n▁ his hands at her waist tightened . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' he grated warningly . \\n▁ ` ` i understand , '' she whispered . \\n▁ he prepared to thrust , a thrill of desire tearing through his body but before he could follow through , her frame went solid at the same instant he heard the distant , dangerous noises . \\n▁ her wide eyes locked with his . \\n▁ ` ` something 's wrong , '' she breathed . \\n▁ her understanding of this when there was no way she could hear the approaching car or the conversation of the people in it , shocked him . \\n▁ he could n't think of that now . \\n▁ yes , sweetling , he spoke to her mind . \\n▁ her limbs tensed around him in a way he thought , after what just occurred , was strangely protective . \\n▁ you do n't want them to hear us talking ? \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ with great regret and a tight control on his anger at the council 's very bad timing , he withdrew but stayed on top of her , pressing her to the bed . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ you 'll need to put on your pajamas . \\n▁ with what happens next , i want you to take your cues from me . \\n▁ they come in , do n't speak unless they speak to you . \\n▁ be very careful of your answers if they ask you questions and tell them as little as you can . \\n▁ he studied her a moment and then finished , if you sense something 's wrong , go with your instinct . \\n▁ her body trembled beneath him . \\n▁ her heart was still racing but now for a different reason . \\n▁ who are they ? \\n▁ you 'll be safe . \\n▁ who are they ? \\n▁ no time for questions , sweetheart , you must trust me . \\n▁ lucien … his hands went from her h * ps to frame her face and he looked into her eyes . \\n▁ trust me , leah . \\n▁ she stared . \\n▁ she swallowed . \\n▁ he watched as her face worked then her eyes flashed . \\n▁ he knew , with grave disappointment , what her answer would be before she spoke it to his brain . \\n▁ however , he was wrong . \\n▁ achingly sweetly , she whispered hesitantly , okay . \\n▁ chapter fifteen the menace before i could blink , lucien and i were in the dressing room he 'd tagged my underwear during his dash and when he set me on my feet he handed them to me . \\n▁ the doorbell rang . \\n▁ without a word i began dressing swiftly . \\n▁ there were a number of things to think about . \\n▁ one being the fact that i punched him . \\n▁ i 'd never hit anyone in my life and i was n't proud of it , not even a little bit . \\n▁ i had a bad temper but i 'd never been moved to violence . \\n▁ even if he was a big , bad , strong vampire who surely could take it and arguably deserved it , there was no excuse . \\n▁ of course , he had declared he 'd never let me go which was a total , complete , utter and very , very , very vicious lie . \\n▁ but still . \\n▁ another was the fact that he 'd spanked me . \\n▁ spanked me . \\n▁ like i was a naughty child . \\n▁ well , not exactly like that but still ! \\n▁ and he did this while doing his mind control business . \\n▁ it was so mortifying it was a wonder i could move at all and was n't literally petrified . \\n▁ especially coupled with the fact that he 'd gone straight from the spanking right to playing my body against me yet a - freaking - gain . \\n▁ and i could n't fight it . \\n▁ i wanted to . \\n▁ my brain screamed at me to especially after the spanking which , during it , even though his strikes caused little pain to anything but my pride , i 'd felt something break in me . \\n▁ something integral to all that was me , leah buchanan , one in the centuries - old line of strong , independent concubines -lrb- if lucien 's word was anything to go by -rrb- . \\n▁ and there was something in the way that it broke i knew that it could never be mended . \\n▁ the weird thing was , i did n't mind . \\n▁ not in the slightest . \\n▁ it was as if it was meant to be . \\n▁ it was as if it had been built solely for the purpose of it existing for when lucien would break it . \\n▁ now how xxunk blank freaky was that ? \\n▁ but i could n't think of any of that now . \\n▁ not now when danger was at the door . \\n▁ bad danger . \\n▁ the worst . \\n▁ so much the worst it was n't danger , it was menace . \\n▁ i felt it crawling , disquieting , threatening , evil , through the very air . \\n▁ to say it made me uneasy was a humongous understatement . \\n▁ i did n't know how i understood this . \\n▁ i did n't even know what i understood . \\n▁ i just knew i understood it . \\n▁ and what i understood was , if this did n't go well , my life would be over . \\n▁ and i also understood that the only thing standing between me and that menace was lucien . \\n▁ he 'd keep me safe . \\n▁ regardless of and contradictory to the scene i 'd just endured at his hands , i knew to the depth of my soul that he 'd do everything in his substantial power to stand between me and whatever was at the door . \\n▁ or he would die trying . \\n▁ this shook me worst of all . \\n▁ but i did n't hesitate . \\n▁ i put on pajamas and for good measure my robe , yanking the belt tightly . \\n▁ then i turned to him , seeing he was waiting for me with his pajama bottoms on . \\n▁ the doorbell rang again . \\n▁ my heart raced . \\n▁ settle , sweetling . \\n▁ his voice sounded in my head as he lifted his hand toward me . \\n▁ without hesitation , i walked to him , sliding my hand in his , his eyes keeping mine captive while i did this . \\n▁ the moment his long fingers closed around my hand dwarfing it , i felt my heart settle and i saw his face gentle . \\n▁ that 's it . \\n▁ his voice , edged with pride , sounded encouragingly in my mind . \\n▁ we walked together slowly , hand - in - hand to the front door . \\n▁ the bell sounded again as we walked . \\n▁ he positioned me , his eyes caught mine in the dark and he placed his hand on my cheek not letting go of my other one . \\n▁ your cues come from me , yes ? \\n▁ he asked , i nodded and he gave me a reassuring smile coupled with a squeeze of my hand . \\n▁ then he let me go and moved away to switch on the light . \\n▁ then he opened the door and stood strong in its frame , barring the way to whoever was out there . \\n▁ i was behind the door . \\n▁ i could n't see who was there and they could n't see me . \\n▁ lucien spoke and he did it in a way that provided me with the information i needed without letting on to our visitors he was doing so . \\n▁ ` ` rudolf , xxunk , marcello , '' he drawled , his voice sounding amused . \\n▁ ` ` they sent three of you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` my profound apologies , lucien , '' a heavily accented , definitely uncomfortable voice replied . \\n▁ ` ` i know it 's very late but unfortunately we 're here to ask you to come with us . '' \\n▁ what ? \\n▁ why ? \\n▁ i held my breath . \\n▁ ` ` this ca n't wait until morning ? '' \\n▁ lucien returned . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ another accented voice , not uncomfortable but hostile , now sounded . \\n▁ ` ` the council waited for you to come to them . \\n▁ now , matters have arisen and they will wait no longer . '' \\n▁ lucien was silent , considering this . \\n▁ ` ` please , lucien , do n't make this difficult . \\n▁ it should n't take long . '' \\n▁ the first voice urged . \\n▁ all amusement was gone when lucien spoke again . \\n▁ ` ` this does not make me happy , rudolf . '' \\n▁ ` ` do n't tell us . \\n▁ tell the council , '' the hostile voice retorted . \\n▁ lucien 's body changed like it did when katrina came to visit . \\n▁ the muscles stood out , defined , deadly . \\n▁ i did n't take this as a good sign . \\n▁ ` ` marcello , '' a third voice , also accented , said the name as a warning . \\n▁ there seemed to be some kind of standoff happening . \\n▁ i could only see lucien 's half of it but i felt it and it scared the freaking heck out of me . \\n▁ finally , lucien 's body relaxed , he stepped back , opening the door wider , his voice now courteous . \\n▁ ` ` wait inside . \\n▁ i 'll be a moment . '' \\n▁ his eyes cut to me . \\n▁ i read his intent and moved to him . \\n▁ his arm curled around my waist , shifting us back so the three , large vampires could fill the foyer . \\n▁ two were dark , both looking latin or italian or something . \\n▁ one was fair . \\n▁ all were gorgeous . \\n▁ my heart skipped a beat . \\n▁ the fair one closed the door then turned which meant all of them were staring at me . \\n▁ i pressed into lucien 's side . \\n▁ ` ` leah , this is rudolf , marcello and xxunk , '' lucien introduced , indicating each with his hand . \\n▁ rudolf was the fair one . \\n▁ i nodded and gave a lame wave . \\n▁ xxunk and rudolf smiled . \\n▁ marcello scowled . \\n▁ ` ` it 's a long awaited pleasure , leah , '' rudolf murmured , his eyes calm and gentle on me . \\n▁ i suspected his words held greater meaning because marcello 's scowl deepened . \\n▁ at the same time xxunk 's smile widened . \\n▁ ` ` thank you . '' \\n▁ my voice was soft and breathy and something changed in the room when i spoke . \\n▁ it was powerful , electric , weirdly both dangerous and seductive and it was emanating from all three . \\n▁ ` ` we wo n't be a moment . '' \\n▁ lucien 's voice cut through the thickened air and he started to move us away . \\n▁ ` ` leah 's to wait here , '' marcello announced , lucien stopped and his eyes sliced to the vampire . \\n▁ ` ` leah will come with me , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ marcello 's gaze moved to me , raking me from top - to - toe and something about the way he did this freaked me out . \\n▁ i did n't know how but i sensed rudolf and xxunk tense and i felt lucien 's body change to that freakishly scary alertness of moments before . \\n▁ ` ` leah will stay , '' marcello declared . \\n▁ lucien did n't reply ; he moved us toward the stairs . \\n▁ before we even got close suddenly lucien was gone from my side . \\n▁ i knew why . \\n▁ i 'd only caught a flash of it but i saw marcello dart forward , his arm extended toward me . \\n▁ then there was a blur of bodies and marcello was against the wall in a poof of broken plaster -lrb- boy , edwina was going to be ticked , she 'd just had the damage from the last vampire fight in the foyer repaired -rrb- . \\n▁ lucien held him like he did katrina , at the throat but his body was close , pressing marcello against the wall , his face not an inch from the other vampire 's . \\n▁ i could only see their profiles but the expression on lucien 's was ferocious . \\n▁ xxunk got close to their sides as rudolf circled . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd touch what 's mine ? '' \\n▁ lucien ground out in a voice so sinister , a chill raced up my spine . \\n▁ ` ` marcello , '' xxunk murmured in soft reprimand and i found his accented voice beautiful even in this tense situation . \\n▁ ` ` you know better , my friend . '' \\n▁ ` ` he made no contact with leah , '' rudolf pointed out quietly . \\n▁ ` ` let him go , lucien . '' \\n▁ it was a request , not a demand . \\n▁ lucien and marcello glared at each other . \\n▁ finally lucien dropped his hand and stepped back . \\n▁ he walked to me and again took my hand . \\n▁ ` ` if the council wants this to go smoothly , control him , '' lucien warned rudolf with a jerk of his head toward marcello and rudolf nodded . \\n▁ then lucien turned us and guided me up the stairs . \\n▁ as he did , he issued orders . \\n▁ the minute i leave , call stephanie , he told me . \\n▁ okay , i agreed promptly . \\n▁ she 'll come immediately . \\n▁ you can trust her . \\n▁ okay , i repeated . \\n▁ do n't answer the phone . \\n▁ if it rings , stephanie deals with it , he went on . \\n▁ okay , i repeated again i do n't want you to be frightened , sweetheart . \\n▁ i 'll handle this . \\n▁ i wanted to laugh . \\n▁ not that it was funny just that i was scared out of my ever - loving mind and no order , even from the mighty lucien , was going to stop that . \\n▁ what 's this about ? \\n▁ i asked when we made it to the dressing room . \\n▁ why are they here ? \\n▁ why are they taking you away ? \\n▁ i ' ve broken the law , lucien replied calmly , as if this was n't a scary - as - shit announcement . \\n▁ he took off his pajama bottoms and started to dress in one of his suits like he was doing nothing more important than preparing to go to work . \\n▁ while he did this , i stared at him frozen in shock . \\n▁ then , my mind breathed to his , you ' ve broken the law ? \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ what law ? \\n▁ i 'll explain later . \\n▁ i did n't want him to explain later . \\n▁ what did it mean , he 'd broken the law ? \\n▁ did that mean they were going to throw him in vampire jail ? \\n▁ did that mean he was going to have to hire a vampire attorney and stand vampire trial ? \\n▁ he 'd just admitted to doing it ! \\n▁ was he going to plead guilty ? \\n▁ i needed way more information . \\n▁ okay then at least tell me what kind of law ? \\n▁ was it like a jaywalking kind of law or a murder in the first degree kind of law ? \\n▁ now dressed , he turned to me and lifted both hands to cup my face and bring me closer . \\n▁ his eyes staring into mine , he repeated , i 'll explain later . \\n▁ i felt my patience , already strained to the breaking point , snap . \\n▁ un - xxunk , my mind retorted , give me something to go on here . \\n▁ he smiled like i was amusing . \\n▁ yes ! \\n▁ smiled ! \\n▁ i felt my eyes narrow . \\n▁ he watched this , his eyes went that sexy - vampire - hooded i wished i did n't like so much then he murmured , ` ` christ , you 're adorable . '' \\n▁ my temper flared and instead of shouting , out of necessity , i mumbled irately , ` ` boy , i wish i could kick your ass . '' \\n▁ his hands left my face , his arms blurring around me with vampire speed , caging me tight against his chest . \\n▁ he threw his head back and roared with laughter . \\n▁ usually , i liked his laughter . \\n▁ okay , being honest with myself , usually , i loved it . \\n▁ and i had n't heard it in weeks . \\n▁ and , worse , even though i did n't want to lament that loss , i did . \\n▁ every day . \\n▁ for three stinking weeks . \\n▁ however at that particular moment , i did not . \\n▁ ` ` this is n't funny , '' i muttered angrily to his chest . \\n▁ i felt him kiss the top of my head . \\n▁ it 's something between jaywalking and murder in the first degree , he told me . \\n▁ that does n't tell me much . \\n▁ it 's all you 're going to get , sweetling . \\n▁ i had no chance to reply . \\n▁ he took my hand and walked us back downstairs . \\n▁ the three vamps were waiting for us . \\n▁ i knew xxunk and rudolf heard the very little we spoke out loud . \\n▁ it would be hard to miss lucien 's shout of laughter even if you did n't have vampire hearing . \\n▁ both of them looked highly amused . \\n▁ our whispered conversation made marcello move from surly to openly hostile . \\n▁ casual as can be , xxunk moved to and opened the door , walking through it . \\n▁ rudolf and marcello followed . \\n▁ all three stopped outside and waited . \\n▁ lucien walked me to the opened door . \\n▁ lock the door behind me . \\n▁ stephanie has a key , he said . \\n▁ instead of nodding , i replied , okay . \\n▁ then he demanded , kiss me . \\n▁ did he just say what i thought he just said ? \\n▁ my eyes widened and i whispered , what ? \\n▁ do it , now . \\n▁ he told me to take my cues from him . \\n▁ that was n't exactly what one would call a cue , more like a command . \\n▁ still , in this troubling situation i felt it sensible to do as he ordered . \\n▁ i leaned in , hands to his abs , getting up on tiptoe and tilting my head back . \\n▁ his own dipped down , i pressed my lips against his and his opened . \\n▁ another cue i was forced to follow , my tongue slid into his mouth . \\n▁ the instant it touched his , his arms came around me like vices , pinning my hands between us , hauling me into his big , hard body . \\n▁ it had been three weeks since he 'd kissed me like this . \\n▁ for three weeks , even during feeding , he 'd been the perfect gentleman . \\n▁ often during those weeks he 'd brush his lips against mine before going to sleep . \\n▁ or he 'd stop , bend and touch his mouth to the top of my head when he 'd walk past me while i was reading . \\n▁ but he had n't really kissed me . \\n▁ clearly my body missed it , so much i forgot our audience . \\n▁ my head tilted to the side , my hands forced themselves from between us , one wrapping around his waist , the other one going into his hair to hold him to me . \\n▁ our tongues dueled , taking , giving , making my body burn and my heart race . \\n▁ like his laughter , it gave me sustenance . \\n▁ i demanded it and took it and more of it and even more of it because it had been so long , i was starving . \\n▁ he broke the kiss and when he did i sensed he did n't like the fact that he had to . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be back soon , '' he murmured against my mouth and stepped away but only after i took a deep , calming breath and nodded . \\n▁ he moved out the door and i finally felt the air . \\n▁ it was again thick with that seductive danger , so thick , the minute i sensed it , it nearly choked me . \\n▁ all three vampires were watching me , now with no hostility and no humor . \\n▁ it did n't take a mind reader to know they were hungry . \\n▁ for what , i was n't sure but my guess was it was me . \\n▁ it was n't my blood they were after but something far more profound . \\n▁ definitely a menace . \\n▁ lucien turned to me , lock the door . \\n▁ then , whoosh , they were gone and all i saw or heard was the doors slamming on the car . \\n▁ i closed and locked the door . \\n▁ then as fast as my feet would carry me , i ran to the phone and called stephanie . \\n▁ * * * * * terror seared through me , all i could think was escape . \\n▁ i collided with something strong , powerful , iron bands went around me , holding me imprisoned . \\n▁ ` ` leah , honey , what on earth ? '' \\n▁ loss . \\n▁ pain . \\n▁ anguish . \\n▁ fear . \\n▁ too much . \\n▁ i could n't cope . \\n▁ burning , burning , the heat was too immense . \\n▁ overwhelming . \\n▁ scalding my eyes . \\n▁ singeing my throat . \\n▁ falling , sharp , uncontrolled , something tightened around my neck . \\n▁ i could n't breathe . \\n▁ i struggled against my gentle prison . \\n▁ ` ` jesus , leah , calm down . \\n▁ what 's the matter ? '' \\n▁ clawing at my bounds , i could hear my choking breaths hitching through my wracking sobs . \\n▁ fingers forced open my mouth , pressed against my tongue , searching for the source of my suffocation . \\n▁ need . \\n▁ need . \\n▁ desperate need . \\n▁ touch . \\n▁ skin . \\n▁ warmth . \\n▁ strength . \\n▁ power . \\n▁ him . \\n▁ needed him . \\n▁ needed his hands , his breath , his presence , him . \\n▁ soothing , soothing , soothing . \\n▁ i had to have him . \\n▁ if i did n't get him , the noose would tighten and i 'd die . \\n▁ ` ` please . '' \\n▁ it was my voice but i did n't recognize the rasping , raw , agonized noise . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god . '' \\n▁ somewhere far away , the phone rang . \\n▁ my prison moved and i struggled to no avail . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , thank god . \\n▁ something 's wrong with leah . \\n▁ she ca n't breathe and i ca n't find out why . \\n▁ she 's fighting me and if i let her go , i fear she 'll do herself more harm . \\n▁ you need to call an ambulance . '' \\n▁ i gasped for breath . \\n▁ my lungs were burning . \\n▁ the blackness was encroaching . \\n▁ ` ` what ? \\n▁ are you mad ? \\n▁ she 's choking , goddamn it , call an ambulance ! '' \\n▁ the noose tightened sharply . \\n▁ i feared it 'd snap my neck and i sensed the sickening strangled noise i heard came from me . \\n▁ ` ` listen , leah , honey , please , listen to the phone … '' the female voice implored urgently . \\n▁ ` ` sweetling … '' his voice sounded in my ear . \\n▁ breath filled my lungs . \\n▁ i took it in in gulps . \\n▁ ` ` hold on , i ' m coming . '' \\n▁ my mind cocooned , nothing came in , nothing went out , nothing went on . \\n▁ xxunk . \\n▁ then he was there , his arms sliding around me , lifting me . \\n▁ i was cradled in his lap , his heat enveloping me , his hold fierce and protective . \\n▁ the aftereffects of the hideous living nightmare still held me in their thrall and , although my senses were returning , i was utterly powerless . \\n▁ a blind , mute ragdoll in lucien 's arms . \\n▁ ` ` how long has she been like this ? '' \\n▁ i heard him ask tersely . \\n▁ ` ` since you talked with her on the phone but trust me , this is better . \\n▁ before that , i swear , lucien , it looked and sounded like she was dying , '' stephanie replied . \\n▁ ` ` christ ! '' \\n▁ lucien 's word was a subdued explosion . \\n▁ his arms got tight , painfully so . \\n▁ it hurt and at the same time it felt beautiful . \\n▁ ` ` has this happened before ? '' \\n▁ stephanie asked . \\n▁ ` ` she has bad dreams , '' lucien answered , his hand beginning to stroke my back . \\n▁ ` ` bad dreams ? \\n▁ luce , that was n't a bad dream . \\n▁ that was completely f * * ked up . \\n▁ i ' m seven hundred and fifty years old and i ' ve seen some serious shit in my life but that was f * * ked up ! '' \\n▁ stephanie was in a state . \\n▁ ` ` tell me exactly what happened , '' lucien demanded . \\n▁ stephanie did n't hesitate . \\n▁ ` ` i heard her scream . \\n▁ it was intense . \\n▁ i came running just in time to catch her leaping out of bed . \\n▁ she was choking , crying . \\n▁ i thought she was just upset about what happened earlier , '' stephanie explained . \\n▁ ` ` then i realized it was something more . \\n▁ the crying stopped , the choking continued . \\n▁ she fought me like no mortal has fought me before . \\n▁ i almost could n't hold her . \\n▁ it was like she was being strangled by something invisible . \\n▁ she was fighting it and she was losing . \\n▁ then you called and talked to her , the strangling stopped but she went limp and unresponsive . \\n▁ honest to god , for a minute , i thought she was dead but i heard her heart beating and her breathing . \\n▁ i put her in bed and she just curled up , eyes open and staring at nothing . \\n▁ i think it 's safe to say she freaked me out ! '' \\n▁ lucien said nothing but he stopped stroking my back , his hand went under my hair and curled warmly around my neck . \\n▁ ` ` she 's still messed up . \\n▁ we need to call a doctor , '' stephanie announced . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine , '' i whispered and wished i did n't . \\n▁ my voice scared me . \\n▁ it scared me because it sounded like i 'd just survived being strangled . \\n▁ at the sound of my voice , lucien 's body went solid . \\n▁ ` ` see ! '' \\n▁ stephanie cried . \\n▁ ` ` leah , sweetheart , can you look at me ? '' \\n▁ lucien 's tone was gentle , his hand moving from my neck to grip my hair and carefully pull my head back . \\n▁ i nodded , the effort at that simple movement felt like running a race but my eyes caught his . \\n▁ ` ` do you remember anything ? '' \\n▁ he asked and i nodded again . \\n▁ ` ` all of it . '' \\n▁ my voice still sounded painfully abrasive because it was painful and abrasive . \\n▁ lucien flinched when i spoke . \\n▁ ` ` ow , '' i whispered . \\n▁ his face went hard before he commanded , ` ` no more talking . '' \\n▁ i nodded again . \\n▁ i was happy with that . \\n▁ way happy . \\n▁ he let go of my hair but his fingers cupped the back of my head and pressed my face to his throat . \\n▁ ` ` we need to call a doctor , '' stephanie repeated . \\n▁ ` ` she 's fine now , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ do … not … think … so . \\n▁ she sounds like she 's been strangled ! '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , i ' m here . \\n▁ she 's fine . '' \\n▁ the air in the room got thick . \\n▁ i tensed before stephanie spoke angrily . \\n▁ ` ` i know pretty much everyone thinks you 're all that , including me most of the time . \\n▁ but as far as i know , you do n't have magical healing powers . '' \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , leave us . \\n▁ get some sleep , '' lucien ordered . \\n▁ ` ` you heard her voice ! '' \\n▁ stephanie yelled and my body twitched at her anger . \\n▁ i felt lucien 's frame turn to stone . \\n▁ his voice was ominous when he demanded , ` ` get the f * * k out of here , now . \\n▁ you 're upsetting leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` i - '' ` ` now ! '' \\n▁ he barked and i jumped . \\n▁ she must have left because the next second i was on the bed alone , bereft of lucien . \\n▁ the second after that i felt his warm , na * * d body the length of mine , his arms tight around me , his heavy legs tangled with mine . \\n▁ i felt the numbness go , my strength and wits returning but the exhaustion stayed heavy upon me . \\n▁ i melted into his heat and he gathered me closer . \\n▁ sleep was coming and i hoped it was the good kind because i needed it . \\n▁ i was battling real and invisible demons and i 'd need all the rest i could get to endure . \\n▁ i was nearly to dreamland when i heard his soft voice make a vow . \\n▁ ` ` that wo n't ever f * * king happen again , leah . \\n▁ you have my promise . '' \\n▁ tears slid up my throat but silently i swallowed them down and burrowed closer . \\n▁ he could n't promise that . \\n▁ even though i had no freaking clue what happened , there was one thing i knew through an intuition the source of which escaped me . \\n▁ coming straight from the core of me , i knew the only way he could make good that promise was never to leave me . \\n▁ never . \\n▁ and that was not going to happen . \\n▁ i had more than one menace -lrb- the gentle one , lucien -rrb- and more than two xxunk -lrb- the frightening one , personified by marcello but also rudolf and xxunk -rrb- , now i had three -lrb- my own mind , which freaked me out most of all -rrb- . \\n▁ i was dead woman walking one way or another . \\n▁ and i was terrified out of my skull . \\n▁ * * * * * ` ` i do n't want leah to overhear . '' \\n▁ lucien 's voice was low but angry . \\n▁ i shifted out of sleep and my eyes opened , seeing nothing but lucien 's vacant pillow . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m thinking leah should be in on this conversation , '' stephanie snapped back . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk . '' \\n▁ another voice , male , vaguely familiar . \\n▁ cosmo . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't understand . '' \\n▁ that was edwina . \\n▁ ` ` can we move to the kitchen ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked a question which was n't a question as much as a politely formed demand . \\n▁ silence . \\n▁ ` ` i just went in there . \\n▁ she 's sleeping . \\n▁ she sleeps very soundly , '' edwina offered in a voice that said she was playing peacemaker . \\n▁ i guessed stephanie was digging in and edwina was hoping she would n't have to repair plaster in the upstairs hallway . \\n▁ lucien must have thought that slamming stephanie into the upstairs wall would likely wake me anyway and probably upset me , so he spoke . \\n▁ and what he said freaked me out . \\n▁ ` ` she has a dream . \\n▁ it 's recurring and it 's connected to me . \\n▁ i know this because i hear her words in my head while she 's dreaming . '' \\n▁ lucien 's voice was low , curt and impatient . \\n▁ ` ` i spoke to her mother and these intense dreams have been happening her whole life . '' \\n▁ i was totally freaked about me talking to lucien 's head when i was dreaming , about what i might have said and about the dream being about him at all considering what that dream did to me , both before my near death experience and during it . \\n▁ but what he said after that took precedence . \\n▁ he spoke to my mother ? \\n▁ now that made me angry . \\n▁ for the last three weeks i 'd been calling all my family , even aunt kate . \\n▁ but not myrna as i had enough of channeling myrna in daily life , i did n't want to have to actually speak to her . \\n▁ desperate for advice , guidance and the lessons lucien stopped giving me until last night ; i was willing to talk to anyone . \\n▁ i 'd even called aunt fiona twice . \\n▁ problem was , when they answered the phone , and i was suspecting they were avoiding that chore when they saw my name come up on their displays , they were busy . \\n▁ busy , busy , busy . \\n▁ even lana , who could talk to a corpse until it reanimated , sat up and told her to shut the hell up . \\n▁ this hurt . \\n▁ i mean , i 'd never moved away from home and i missed them a lot . \\n▁ but it seemed like they were getting on with life without me just fine . \\n▁ when lana had been selected , she 'd been lucky enough to move not that far away , a three hour drive . \\n▁ she was home all the time . \\n▁ my move was a two hour plane ride . \\n▁ i thought they 'd feel my absence but the whirlwind of ` ` i have a lunch date … '' , ` ` we 're about to catch a movie … '' , ` ` i have a facial in twenty minutes … '' , ` ` if i do n't get to that sale , that pair of shoes is going to be gone and i 'll just die if i do n't own them … '' -lrb- that was aunt nadia , she liked shoes nearly as much as me -rrb- was all i heard . \\n▁ not a single , ` ` so , leah , how are you getting on with the mighty vampire lucien who you so desperately did not want to be separated from your adored family and pack of friends to go and service ? \\n▁ are you okay ? \\n▁ do you need , per chance , to talk to a beloved , trusted family member ? '' \\n▁ silly , mean , awful buchanan bitches . \\n▁ now i find my mother , my mother , was chatting with lucien . \\n▁ i was going to disown her . \\n▁ as soon as she talked to me long enough for me to share that morsel that was . \\n▁ stephanie 's amazed words brought me back to my chore of just woken up eavesdropping . \\n▁ ` ` like last night ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i talked to lydia this morning and she said that never happened to leah , '' cosmo put in . \\n▁ ` ` she said often her dreams would be frightening and she 'd be nearly inconsolable afterwards but she only cried or screamed , sometimes fought . \\n▁ nothing like what you described last night . '' \\n▁ so , mom was also not too busy to have a xxunk with cosmo either . \\n▁ totally disowned . \\n▁ ` ` she 's very concerned , '' cosmo continued . \\n▁ yeah right , i seethed . \\n▁ ` ` she should be concerned , '' stephanie clipped . \\n▁ ` ` it was f * * king scary . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m concerned , '' edwina said quietly and i knew she meant it . \\n▁ i liked edwina and at that moment i liked her even more . \\n▁ maybe i 'd ask her to be my new mom . \\n▁ ` ` she has abilities , '' lucien shared and you could tell he did n't much like it . \\n▁ my body tensed and my ears perked up . \\n▁ ` ` abilities ? '' \\n▁ cosmo prompted . \\n▁ i imagined lucien nodding before he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` she can fight xxunk . \\n▁ not long , seconds , but longer than anyone else . \\n▁ she can talk back when you 're communicating with her , hold entire conversations , like you . '' \\n▁ i did n't know who he meant but i guessed it was either stephanie or cosmo . \\n▁ ` ` she can also get into my head , speak to me without me calling to her . \\n▁ she can do it on her own , again , like you . '' \\n▁ i could n't believe what i was hearing . \\n▁ not everyone could do that ? \\n▁ lucien continued , ` ` her senses are advanced , particularly her sense of danger . \\n▁ either that or she has the reciprocal ability to mark me , making me xxunk to her in a way that i do n't feel it and she does n't know she 's doing it . \\n▁ either way , when there 's danger or a situation is uncertain , she senses it . '' \\n▁ ` ` fucking hell , '' cosmo muttered . \\n▁ ` ` you 're joking , '' stephanie whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i knew she was special , '' edwina stated . \\n▁ edwina was so … totally … my new mom . \\n▁ ` ` i think it 's marking , '' lucien decreed and my heart started tripping . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve never been marked . \\n▁ i do the marking but twice i ' ve felt her trying to xxunk herself to me , sense my thoughts , my mood . \\n▁ it took effort to hold her back . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ that whole pulsating thing . \\n▁ i remembered wanting to know his mood . \\n▁ i thought he was trying to probe mine but i was probing his ! \\n▁ and he was blocking me out which must have been why i was pulsating . \\n▁ ` ` how bizarre , '' stephanie mumbled . \\n▁ she could say that again ! \\n▁ ` ` i have a theory , '' lucien declared and i stopped breathing like this would help me hear better . \\n▁ ` ` her bloodline has been absorbing vampire essence for a long time . \\n▁ each respective generation taking in more than any other concubine line . \\n▁ i think it 's affected her line and mutated , giving her powers other mortals do n't have . '' \\n▁ i started breathing again . \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ i was maybe mutated . \\n▁ vampire powers spliced in my genes . \\n▁ that was huge ! \\n▁ and cool ! \\n▁ i know you 're awake , my pet . \\n▁ my body jerked . \\n▁ holy heck ! \\n▁ lucien was so , freaking annoying . \\n▁ i could n't even eavesdrop without him xxunk on . \\n▁ ` ` i would n't share that with the council , '' cosmo warned , tearing me away from my thoughts . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no intention to , '' lucien replied , his voice closer , coming my way and i assessed my options . \\n▁ i did n't know if he was angry but eavesdropping was never nice . \\n▁ of course , in my defense , they were standing outside the door and the door was open . \\n▁ i considered throwing myself out the window but i did n't think my mutant vampire abilities translated to not breaking my leg upon such a feat . \\n▁ and i had n't been servicing lucien long enough to get my super - healing vampire mojo going yet so i figured i should just face the consequences . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , we 're not done talking , '' stephanie called . \\n▁ ` ` leah 's awake , '' lucien informed her , sounding like he was right at the door . \\n▁ silence then , ` ` shit , she is . \\n▁ i was n't paying attention . '' \\n▁ boy , vampires hearing heartbeats and breathing really sucked sometimes . \\n▁ lucien appeared . \\n▁ he closed the door and walked slowly to me . \\n▁ ` ` hey , '' i said hesitantly , testing his mood . \\n▁ my voice was rough as sandpaper . \\n▁ this was a good move on my part . \\n▁ his expression had been thoughtful as if trying to decide which irritating , dominating vampire punishment to mete out . \\n▁ upon hearing my voice , his eyes flashed then gentled as did his face . \\n▁ he threw back the covers and got in bed with me even though he was fully - clothed , wearing jeans and a tight - fitting black t - shirt . \\n▁ he pulled me in his arms . \\n▁ ` ` when did you know i was awake ? '' \\n▁ i rasped . \\n▁ ` ` the minute you woke , '' he informed the top of my head scarily . \\n▁ ` ` now , stop speaking . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m fine , '' i argued even though i did n't sound fine , i really was . \\n▁ i did n't feel any different than normal except my throat was kind of sore . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not arguing about this . '' \\n▁ ` ` but - '' quiet , leah . \\n▁ he mind - controlled me . \\n▁ big , bad , vampire jerk ! \\n▁ i hate it when you do that , i snapped . \\n▁ why would you use your voice when we can converse perfectly well like this ? \\n▁ he had a point . \\n▁ still , for good measure , i pouted . \\n▁ seeing as my face was in his neck and he could n't see me pouting , this was a moot pout but at least it made me feel better . \\n▁ talk to me about last night , he ordered . \\n▁ what do you want to know ? \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ everything , he answered . \\n▁ i sighed then gave in . \\n▁ no sense fighting it , he was even more stubborn than me . \\n▁ i had the dream again , i told him and stopped sharing . \\n▁ when i said no more , he prompted , i guessed that . \\n▁ i kept going , i do n't know what happened . \\n▁ i still do n't remember what i dream but it 's like the dream kept going even after i woke up . \\n▁ how ? \\n▁ i shook my head but answered , it felt , i know this is going to sound totally unhinged , but it felt like i was being hanged . \\n▁ his body went completely taut . \\n▁ i 'd felt this before , of course , many times but there was something different about this time . \\n▁ very different and very wrong . \\n▁ lucien ? \\n▁ tell me more , he commanded , even his voice in my head sounded tight . \\n▁ this alarmed me so i continued , i could feel stephanie , sense the real world around me . \\n▁ i even heard the phone ring when you called . \\n▁ but i was still in the dream and it was more powerful . \\n▁ it felt like the floor went out from under me and the noose was strangling me . \\n▁ did you see anything ? \\n▁ like what ? \\n▁ like me . \\n▁ this time , my body grew tight . \\n▁ i know you 're dreaming of me , leah . \\n▁ now his voice was soft and coaxing . \\n▁ i do n't know that . \\n▁ you are , sweetheart . \\n▁ what do you hear me say ? \\n▁ let 's focus on you . \\n▁ i 'd rather focus on what you hear . \\n▁ later . \\n▁ now . \\n▁ his arms grew tight and the breath went out of me . \\n▁ ` ` do you see me in your dream ? \\n▁ did you see me last night ? '' \\n▁ he demanded to know . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` did you feel heat ? '' \\n▁ that confused me . \\n▁ heat ? \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` like a fire . '' \\n▁ my head jerked back and i looked up at him with wide eyes . \\n▁ yes , i breathed . \\n▁ i watched as his eyes closed slowly and his jaw got tight , not like he was angry , like he was in pain . \\n▁ i felt his pain . \\n▁ it hurt . \\n▁ his look was also familiar . \\n▁ i did n't know why but it was very familiar like i 'd seen it before and it scared me . \\n▁ lucien ! \\n▁ i cried . \\n▁ his eyes opened . \\n▁ what ? \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ his hand at the back of my head tucked my face in his throat again as he answered , ` ` nothing , sweetling . '' \\n▁ that was n't nothing ! \\n▁ ` ` just relax , '' he ordered . \\n▁ yeah , right , you relax . \\n▁ i ' m freaking out ! \\n▁ ` ` everything will be fine . '' \\n▁ sure . \\n▁ everything will be fine . \\n▁ you 're a vampire renegade , breaking laws and getting carted in to talk to the council in the middle of the night . \\n▁ your estranged mate wants me dead . \\n▁ creepy marcello - with - a - death - wish nearly touches me and you morph into super lucien , the mighty concubine protector . \\n▁ and even my dreams want me dead ! \\n▁ yep , all 's normal ! \\n▁ nothing to worry about here ! \\n▁ after my mental tirade delivered directly to his brain which was totally bizarre in itself , the most bizarre of all was that i was communicating with him like this and it did n't feel bizarre in the slightest , i felt his body shaking . \\n▁ he was laughing . \\n▁ it started silently then it became chuckles . \\n▁ he pulled me up , lifted his head and buried his face in my neck . \\n▁ this is n't f * * king funny , i declared , and it sure as hell was n't . \\n▁ he kept laughing . \\n▁ what happened last night ? \\n▁ i demanded to know . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll tell you later . '' \\n▁ his voice was still filled with mirth as he spoke against my neck . \\n▁ now . \\n▁ ` ` later , '' he murmured . \\n▁ now , lucien ! \\n▁ i insisted . \\n▁ you ca n't just leave me after that drama , all worried about you and then not … i stopped nagging his brain and went still . \\n▁ i did this for two reasons . \\n▁ one , because he went still too . \\n▁ completely . \\n▁ nearly as solid as when we were talking about my dream . \\n▁ two , because one part of my idiot brain caught up with what the other , more idiot part of my idiot brain was actually saying . \\n▁ his head came up . \\n▁ i twisted my neck to look up at him and wished my possible vampire abilities extended to turning back time so i could take back words . \\n▁ ` ` you were worried about me ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ i tried to cover . \\n▁ well , you know , anyone would get worried when someone was carted off in the middle of the night . \\n▁ ` ` they would n't be worried if they hated the person who was being carted off , '' he pointed out logically but his voice was pure velvet and it seemed to glide across every inch of my skin . \\n▁ why oh why was i such a freaking loser ! \\n▁ do n't read anything into that , lucien , i warned . \\n▁ he grinned and it was his arrogant grin . \\n▁ ` ` hard not to , pet . '' \\n▁ well , try , i pushed . \\n▁ his face got closer and his voice was still velvet . \\n▁ ` ` i rather like what i ' m reading . '' \\n▁ may i remind you that you spanked me last night . \\n▁ spanked me ! \\n▁ i snapped . \\n▁ ` ` oh , i remember . '' \\n▁ still velvet , still gliding across my skin , now i was getting goose bumps . \\n▁ then his eyelids slowly lowered to half - mast and he muttered , ` ` i ' m thinking i should have done that at your initial bloodletting . \\n▁ saved time . '' \\n▁ my body went tight then it jerked against his hold . \\n▁ i knew this would have no effect but i felt better doing it . \\n▁ it was high time to change the subject . \\n▁ i need food , i declared . \\n▁ ` ` me too , '' he whispered . \\n▁ damn it all to hell , that got a response . \\n▁ i felt my ni * * les get hard and i went instantly wet . \\n▁ he knew it . \\n▁ i knew he knew it because i saw the flash of a satisfied , smug smile before his face disappeared in my neck . \\n▁ his lips traveled down my chest and , with one arm locked around my waist , the other hand came up to my camisole and tugged it down sharply to expose one of my br * * sts . \\n▁ i gasped . \\n▁ then i felt his tongue at the side of my breast , fire shot between my legs and i squirmed . \\n▁ let me speak , i whispered and the instant i did , his mind released mine and i felt the blood flow . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' i breathed . \\n▁ powerless to stop them , my hands went to his head , fisting in his hair , holding him to me as the sweet , familiar thrill from his feeding shot through me . \\n▁ his hand came up , fingers wrapping around my wrist , he pulled it away and down . \\n▁ taking my hand in his own , he guided it into my pajamas , my undies , straight to the heat of me . \\n▁ his fingers manipulating mine against my most sensitive part , he coaxed a deeper response . \\n▁ i took over and his hand moved , a finger sliding in me then two then he stroked , the rhythm sure and strong , practiced and powerful , building in intensity and quickness . \\n▁ with the feeding , my own fingers and his thrusts , it took only moments for me to come . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' i whispered in my raspy voice and when i did , my fisted hand in his hair tightened at the same time holding him to me . \\n▁ it was consuming . \\n▁ it was beautiful . \\n▁ i had n't had that in three weeks either . \\n▁ it nourished me too . \\n▁ he imprisoned my hand cupped under his between my legs , lashed the wound at my breast with his tongue , pulled up and rolled into me . \\n▁ with his weight pressed against my side , his face in my hair , he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve broken , '' he declared , victory warm in his tone . \\n▁ i suspected he was n't wrong . \\n▁ i did n't tell him that . \\n▁ ` ` now , you 're mine , '' he went on , the warmth of victory turning heated , brutal , savage and fierce . \\n▁ i suspected he was n't wrong about that either . \\n▁ boy , was i so f * * ked . \\n▁ his head came up , his hand pulling mine from between my legs , it lifted it , curling my arm around his waist . \\n▁ he tugged my camisole back over my breast , rolled deeper into me so he was almost on top of me and then he rested his hand against my neck , thumb stroking , head up , eyes locked to mine . \\n▁ ` ` tonight , we join , '' he decreed , his voice still fierce as were his eyes . \\n▁ i felt something unsettling . \\n▁ his eyes were blazing , the triumph blatant , searing into me , so hot , so fierce , i felt branded . \\n▁ but it was n't the first time i felt that . \\n▁ i 'd felt it before . \\n▁ even though i knew i had n't . \\n▁ just like earlier , when he 'd closed his eyes in pain . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? \\n▁ did you hear me ? '' \\n▁ my mind was elsewhere but i still answered , ` ` i heard you . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he called , i shook off my troubling thoughts and focused on him . \\n▁ ` ` what we 'll have will be beautiful , '' he told me , voice back to velvet . \\n▁ i suspected he was n't wrong about that either . \\n▁ the problem with that was , even though it would undoubtedly be beautiful , whatever it was , it would be temporary . \\n▁ tarnished beauty . \\n▁ could i live with that ? \\n▁ ` ` sweetling , '' velvet still but there was an odd throb to it like an ache , ` ` whatever that is working in the backs of your eyes , let it go . \\n▁ you give this to me ; i 'll take care of it . '' \\n▁ his voice dipped lower before he finished , ` ` that 's a vow . '' \\n▁ of course , seeing as i was expelled from vampire studies , i had no idea how binding a vampire 's vow was . \\n▁ i had no idea they 'd kill to protect it and die before they 'd break it . \\n▁ i had no idea they 'd quest to the ends of the earth for centuries to fulfill it or that they 'd endure torture to keep it safe . \\n▁ so , even though i believed that he believed he was n't feeding me a line , i knew different . \\n▁ still , with that thing in me broken , unable to keep him out any longer , i had no choice . \\n▁ so i looked him in the eyes and whispered , ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ my submission was immediately rewarded . \\n▁ he pulled me tight into his arms and gave me one of his demanding , bruising , possessive , branding and undeniably savage kisses that left me breathless . \\n▁ then he carried me all the way to the kitchen , deposited me on a stool , ordered a concerned , fawning edwina and an equally concerned but not fawning stephanie and cosmo out of the kitchen and he made breakfast . \\n▁ amongst many other things , that morning i found out lucien could cook . \\n▁ chapter sixteen the aunties i lay curled in the big beanbag in the comfy , seating area off the kitchen while edwina made dinner and avery sat on the couch , chatting to her . \\n▁ avery was who i guessed was my protector for the evening . \\n▁ even though it was sunday and edwina was supposed to be off , she did n't leave . \\n▁ and even though it was sunday and ever since our first sunday together lucien had made a habit of being with me in some way all day -lrb- even these last three weeks when he 'd not been pushy , domineering , lucien -rrb- , lucien did leave . \\n▁ he took off with cosmo after breakfast , and another demanding , bruising , possessive , branding and undeniably savage kiss , right in front of everyone , going to places unknown and xxunk with , oh , say , me . \\n▁ stephanie hung out until avery arrived that afternoon then she immediately took off . \\n▁ this was how i knew avery was my protector . \\n▁ the only thing i knew they were protecting me from was what lucien commanded edwina and stephanie to look out for before he left . \\n▁ in fact , he had a load of commands . \\n▁ ` ` she rests and she does n't speak . \\n▁ got me ? '' \\n▁ was his first . \\n▁ his second , ` ` no phone calls . \\n▁ no visitors . \\n▁ she does n't go near any door and she does n't go outside . '' \\n▁ his third , ` ` she does n't sleep , not even a nap , not without me in the house . \\n▁ not just today , everyday . \\n▁ am i understood ? '' \\n▁ he could , of course , have told me these things . \\n▁ however , it was very likely i 'd give him lip which was probably what he was trying to avoid . \\n▁ instead , i spoke directly to his mind . \\n▁ seriously bossy vampire ! \\n▁ i snapped . \\n▁ his head jerked toward me . \\n▁ i figured i was in trouble but his lips twitched , he walked right into my space and that 's when i got the kiss . \\n▁ i had the sneaking suspicion lucien was providing protection for me not because my own flipping dream nearly killed me and he needed someone around to keep me awake . \\n▁ but because there were other , more dangerous xxunk from which he needed to keep me safe . \\n▁ i did n't want to go there but i could n't anyway . \\n▁ lucien was gone before i could form a word in his mind . \\n▁ it would have to wait for that night and the good thing was , it would delay ` ` the joining '' something which , i had to admit , i was looking forward to xxunk . \\n▁ in fact , if i let myself think about it for more than two seconds , i 'd start panting and my legs would get restless . \\n▁ it also scared the hell out of me mainly because just thinking about it made me pant , what would happen when it happened ? \\n▁ would i spontaneously combust ? \\n▁ i had a pad of paper in my hands on which i was meant to write whatever i wanted to communicate . \\n▁ i was doing this even though i tested out my voice in the bathroom and , seeing as my throat felt better -lrb- because edwina kept giving me throat lozenges -rrb- , my voice sounded almost normal . \\n▁ edwina gave the pad to me and if i even opened my mouth , her hand would shoot up , palm facing me and then she 'd point at the pad . \\n▁ at that moment , instead of using it to communicate , i was doodling on it . \\n▁ then i felt avery 's eyes on me . \\n▁ mine slid to him . \\n▁ he smiled . \\n▁ really , even though he was somewhat weird - looking , he was also very attractive . \\n▁ i ripped the doodling sheet off the top , wrote him a note and passed it to him . \\n▁ he read it and shook his head , handing the pad back to me , ` ` i ' m not a vampire , leah . '' \\n▁ i wrote another note and passed it to him . \\n▁ he did the reading thing and gave it back to me . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i ' m immortal . '' \\n▁ wow ! \\n▁ i was guessing ! \\n▁ my brows shot up . \\n▁ ` ` maybe you should - '' edwina started , all of a sudden there , standing behind the couch looking a little worried . \\n▁ avery lifted a long knobby knuckled quieting hand and edwina was silenced . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i asked and edwina gave me a look . \\n▁ i wrote sorry in big block letters on the pad and showed it to her . \\n▁ her head tilted to the side . \\n▁ she winked at me and fluttered back to the kitchen . \\n▁ avery spoke . \\n▁ ` ` she 's concerned . \\n▁ as you 're in the life , you 're entitled to know about vampire culture . \\n▁ but other cultures are kept from you . \\n▁ they 're secret as the vampire culture is secret from all mortals outside of it . \\n▁ in other words , i ca n't tell you what i am . '' \\n▁ my eyes went wide then i wrote on my pad and turned it to show him . \\n▁ ` ` yes , leah , there are other cultures , other kinds of immortals , '' he paused then continued , ` ` and other creatures . '' \\n▁ this was news . \\n▁ seriously nutty , outrageous news . \\n▁ i wrote on my pad again and showed him . \\n▁ he read it and smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i trust you to keep my secret , little one . '' \\n▁ only avery , who was seven foot tall and mammoth , would be able to get away with calling me ` ` little one '' . \\n▁ he went on , ` ` though , if anyone ever knew i told you , i 'd be sentenced to death . '' \\n▁ i felt my eyes bug out in horror and he laughed and continued , ` ` we take our secrets very seriously . '' \\n▁ i wrote no kidding on my pad . \\n▁ he read it and chuckled again . \\n▁ then i wrote why ? \\n▁ ` ` do the words ` angry villagers ' mean anything to you ? '' \\n▁ he asked , trying to make it a joke but i did n't take it as such . \\n▁ i felt my heart hurt like it did last night when lucien explained the world he was forced to live in . \\n▁ not only hiding his magnificence but also being roundly and kind of sickeningly used and misunderstood . \\n▁ i wrote angrily on my pad again and showed it to avery . \\n▁ when he read it , his face grew soft , his big hand came out and he tugged a lock of my hair . \\n▁ then his gentle eyes looked deep into mine and he whispered , ` ` not all mortals suck , leah . '' \\n▁ his words washed over me and i smiled at him . \\n▁ it was shaky , my heart still hurt but i was glad he did n't blame me for whatever tortures his people endured from my people , either xxunk or inadvertently . \\n▁ the phone rang . \\n▁ edwina answered it then brought it to me . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she said and my heart skipped an irritating beat . \\n▁ i took it and put it to my ear . \\n▁ then i did n't know what to do , his command was no talking . \\n▁ could i do long distance , mutant vampire abilities , telepathic communication ? \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ he called . \\n▁ i was silent . \\n▁ ` ` you can talk , sweetling , '' he said softly . \\n▁ i was relieved . \\n▁ then i was cross . \\n▁ ` ` you know , it totally sucks that i have to wait for you to let me speak , '' i informed him xxunk . \\n▁ he chuckled . \\n▁ damn the vampire ! \\n▁ i ignored the chuckle . \\n▁ ` ` did you manage not to get arrested today ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ more chuckling . \\n▁ but , i noted , no answer . \\n▁ ` ` for my peace of mind , i 'll take that as a yes . \\n▁ so , did you break any laws ? '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' i cut him off with , ` ` speeding ticket ? '' \\n▁ he burst out laughing . \\n▁ i fumed . \\n▁ ` ` you 're sounding better , '' he commented after his hilarity died down . \\n▁ ` ` like i said this morning , i ' m fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're fine because you ' ve rested your throat all day , '' he returned . \\n▁ he was probably right . \\n▁ that and edwina 's obsessive administration of throat lozenges . \\n▁ i did n't share either of these tidbits of knowledge with him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m on my way home , '' he informed me . \\n▁ ` ` goodie , '' i said with saccharine sweetness but i felt my pulse race . \\n▁ i ignored my pulse . \\n▁ lucien ignored my grumpiness . \\n▁ ` ` have you eaten ? '' \\n▁ ` ` edwina 's making dinner now . '' \\n▁ ` ` good . \\n▁ i 'll be home in five minutes . '' \\n▁ ` ` you know , '' i said xxunk , ` ` you do n't have to call when you 're five minutes from home . \\n▁ we could have had this extremely pressing conversation five minutes from now , when you are home . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , my pet , but i worried about you all day and found i could n't wait five minutes more to assure myself you were all right . '' \\n▁ that took the bitchiness out of me . \\n▁ mainly because his words made me feel really , really good . \\n▁ and that scared me silly or , in this case , it scared me right back to bitchy . \\n▁ ` ` stop being so nice , '' i snapped . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ his voice held a burgeoning chuckle . \\n▁ ` ` because i do n't know what to do with it , '' i replied . \\n▁ his voice turned velvet . \\n▁ ` ` tonight , i 'll teach you what to do with it . '' \\n▁ my womb -lrb- and parts south -rrb- rippled and it felt great . \\n▁ moving on ! \\n▁ ` ` see you soon , '' i told him . \\n▁ ` ` soon , pet , '' he replied and then disconnected . \\n▁ i hit the button to turn off the phone , ignored my still rippling female parts and announced to the room , ` ` lucien says i can talk and he 'll be home in five minutes . '' \\n▁ edwina flitted forward , wielding a throat lozenge . \\n▁ ` ` one more , dear , just to be on the safe side . '' \\n▁ i caught avery 's amused grin as i took it and popped it in my mouth even though i did n't need it and i did n't want it . \\n▁ she was concerned . \\n▁ it made her feel better . \\n▁ i wanted her to feel better and , furthermore , i wanted her to be my new mom so i did n't want to scare her off with leah attitude before she took on the role . \\n▁ the attitude would come later , the first time she told me to behave myself which would happen , no doubt about it . \\n▁ lucien had been wrong . \\n▁ he was n't home in five minutes . \\n▁ he was home in four . \\n▁ it was embarrassing to admit but i watched the freaking clock . \\n▁ to hide the fact that i 'd had such a girlie , obsessed with a hottie vampire who was going to join with me that very night thing , i did n't bother to rise from the beanbag when he came in . \\n▁ i should have known better . \\n▁ he hooked the keys on the holder , nodded to edwina 's greeting , shook hands with avery and then came direct to my beanbag . \\n▁ ` ` yo , '' i said , looking up at him . \\n▁ mistress cool . \\n▁ his mouth twitched . \\n▁ my female parts rippled . \\n▁ before i knew it , i was plucked out of the beanbag and found myself in lucien 's arms . \\n▁ not like a normal , give your concubine a hug upon arriving home . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ he had my legs wrapped around his waist , my arms automatically went around his shoulders to hold on and his hands were at my ass . \\n▁ his head tilted back to look at me and he murmured , ` ` how was your day , sweetling ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i wrote everything i wanted to say on a pad of paper all day , '' i answered . \\n▁ ` ` do you know how annoying that is ? '' \\n▁ ` ` was it that difficult ? '' \\n▁ he asked , his black eyes dancing with suppressed humor . \\n▁ it was n't . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i answered huffily . \\n▁ i got another lip twitch , one of his hands left my ass , slid up my back and tangled in my hair . \\n▁ ` ` your torture 's over , '' he muttered before pressing down on my head so he could kiss me . \\n▁ not a normal , because you have company , give your concubine a seemly peck on the lips upon arriving home . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ a full on , mouths open , tongues dueling , ravenous , feasting snog . \\n▁ i was panting when it was done and i 'd totally forgotten avery and edwina existed much less they were in the room . \\n▁ i 'd like to take you upstairs right now , his mind told mine and his voice sounded deliciously hungry in my head . \\n▁ one could say , at that precise moment , i 'd like that too . \\n▁ i decided not to speak . \\n▁ then he asked , his voice in my head sounding both sweetly intimate and even more sweetly teasing , throat lozenges ? \\n▁ i could n't help it and i did n't know why i could n't but i giggled . \\n▁ edwina , i answered . \\n▁ all day . \\n▁ i ' ve had six hundred of them at least . \\n▁ his eyes were on my mouth , his mouth was grinning . \\n▁ ah , he murmured in understanding . \\n▁ avery cleared his throat . \\n▁ ` ` i think we 're missing something . '' \\n▁ i looked at avery then at lucien before i pushed against his shoulders and placed the blame squarely and publically on him . \\n▁ ` ` you 're being rude . '' \\n▁ his brows went up but he dropped me to my feet and curled me into his side with an arm around my shoulders . \\n▁ ` ` you 're staying for dinner ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked avery and i marveled that even a courteous invitation from lucien sounded like a command . \\n▁ ` ` leave now and miss edwina 's cooking ? \\n▁ i 'd rather … '' avery started , i tensed and lucien 's and avery 's heads snapped toward the front door . \\n▁ ` ` company , '' avery muttered . \\n▁ reflexively , my hand lifted , fingers fisting in lucien 's shirt at his stomach as i looked up at him . \\n▁ this was xxunk behavior , i knew , but we had n't had a lot of luck with the front door . \\n▁ usually , someone at my front door meant a call to the handyman . \\n▁ lucien 's head was cocked and i knew he was listening . \\n▁ then he mumbled , ` ` fucking hell . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ his eyes caught mine . \\n▁ then he said , ` ` xxunk . '' \\n▁ he said this right before there was an imperative and constant knocking at the door , confirming lucien 's words . \\n▁ only aunt kate could knock on a door like that . \\n▁ it was her signature . \\n▁ even when she was coming over for a cup of coffee and a gab , she eschewed xxunk and knocked on the door like she was queen of the world and how dare the lowly commoner inside not anticipate her arrival , sweep open the door and throw rose petals at her feet . \\n▁ ` ` aunt kate , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` kate , '' lucien agreed . \\n▁ ` ` oh dear , oh dear , '' edwina fretted as she fluttered toward the hall . \\n▁ ` ` how many are there ? \\n▁ i do n't know if we have enough food . '' \\n▁ avery followed edwina but lucien curled me into his front . \\n▁ i looked up at him when he asked , ` ` if it seems your family will interrupt our plans for this evening , if i ' m forced to eject them bodily , how would you react ? '' \\n▁ he was teasing again . \\n▁ it was frustrated teasing but he still did it really , really well . \\n▁ i was seeing the benefits of having a kind of like boyfriend who was centuries old . \\n▁ he had a lot of good stuff down pat . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve decided i ' m mad at them . \\n▁ they ' ve been ignoring me , '' i admitted . \\n▁ ` ` but not sure about bodily ejection . \\n▁ could you , you know , mighty vampire lucien command them to leave ? '' \\n▁ i said the words ` ` mighty vampire lucien '' in a fake pompous voice which was why i think lucien yanked me in his arms and gave me a tight hug as he threw his head back and shouted with laughter . \\n▁ this was what my family saw when they filed into the room looking uppity and in dire need of a martini . \\n▁ i decided to glare . \\n▁ i mean , in my hour of need , they 'd ignored me and here they were when my hour of need was beyond me -lrb- not exactly , but in a way -rrb- and the good parts -lrb- one particular one i had in mind -rrb- were happening that very night . \\n▁ ` ` i need a drink , '' aunt kate announced grandly . \\n▁ ` ` leah , honey , are you okay ? '' \\n▁ mom asked worriedly . \\n▁ ` ` is that roast chicken i smell ? '' \\n▁ aunt millicent enquired , sniffing . \\n▁ ` ` ohmigod , i love your blouse ! '' \\n▁ aunt nadia screeched excitedly . \\n▁ ` ` well , hello to you too , '' i replied to them all . \\n▁ ` ` so , you remember i exist ? '' \\n▁ aunt kate 's eyes narrowed . \\n▁ mom looked guilty . \\n▁ aunt millicent glanced away . \\n▁ aunt nadia bit her lip . \\n▁ lucien gave me a shoulder squeeze and murmured , ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` sorry but i was expelled from vampire studies and i did happen to find myself living with a vampire and my family does happen to be the premier family of vampire concubines so forgive me for expecting a little guidance and support ! '' \\n▁ i fired off . \\n▁ the collective of buchanan women 's eyes moved to lucien . \\n▁ once they did , so did my own . \\n▁ lucien let me go and shrugged off his suit jacket . \\n▁ he dropped it on the arm of the couch and suggested , ` ` perhaps we should all have a drink . '' \\n▁ i did n't think this was good . \\n▁ aunt kate disagreed . \\n▁ ` ` capital idea ! '' \\n▁ she announced . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ i called . \\n▁ drink , he said in my head . \\n▁ i 'll explain in a minute . \\n▁ he 'll explain ? \\n▁ what did this have to do with lucien ? \\n▁ then it hit me . \\n▁ the aunties visit a month ago when i did n't get the chance to talk to them . \\n▁ i was right , this was n't good . \\n▁ i crossed my arms , jutted my hip , threw out a leg and tapped my toe . \\n▁ if any of my past boyfriends saw me in this stance , they would ask no questions . \\n▁ they would n't utter a noise . \\n▁ they would cut and run straight for the hills . \\n▁ lucien glanced at me as he headed for the drinks cabinet . \\n▁ when his eyes hit me , they traveled from chest - to - toe then straight to my face . \\n▁ then i saw him bite back a smile . \\n▁ big , fat , vampire jerk ! \\n▁ i immediately changed my mind regarding our later activities . \\n▁ if he thought we were ` ` joining '' tonight , he had another think coming . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll make more stuffing and potatoes and warm up more rolls . '' \\n▁ edwina was fussing in the kitchen . \\n▁ ` ` maybe whip up a pie . '' \\n▁ i was about to offer my help when i was interrupted . \\n▁ ` ` you were expelled from vampire studies ? '' \\n▁ avery asked , his amused stare locked on me . \\n▁ ` ` i was caught texting , passing notes , throwing xxunk and writing my last will and testament , '' i declared . \\n▁ avery burst out laughing . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk ? '' \\n▁ lucien voice came at me from behind . \\n▁ i turned and saw he had a bottle of vodka in his hand , his brows were up and he did n't look amused . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , '' i snapped rebelliously . \\n▁ ` ` oh , can we please not talk about that ? \\n▁ it took some palm greasing to get that instructor to keep his mouth shut , '' aunt kate lamented and sent me her look that since i was four and even now that i was forty never failed to pin me to the spot . \\n▁ ` ` anyone else learns of this and it 's sure to taint the buchanan name . '' \\n▁ ` ` i still think it 's kind of funny , katie , '' aunt nadia whispered , giving me a wink . \\n▁ ` ` um , excuse me , but does anyone want to talk about my daughter nearly dying from a bad dream last night ? \\n▁ anyone ? \\n▁ anyone ? \\n▁ or is it just me ? '' \\n▁ mom demanded xxunk . \\n▁ i stared at lucien 's back and stated , ` ` i 'd prefer to know why my family has been avoiding me for a month . '' \\n▁ do n't try me , lucien warned in my head . \\n▁ kiss my concubine ass , i returned to his . \\n▁ he did n't turn but i saw him shake his head in that way men do when they think women are entirely too ridiculous for words . \\n▁ but , seeing as this was lucien , he did it far better than any man of my acquaintance and there were lots of men of my acquaintance who would shake their heads like i was too ridiculous for words . \\n▁ it was then that i saw the drawbacks of having a kind of like boyfriend who was centuries old . \\n▁ he had a lot of bad stuff down pat , too . \\n▁ ` ` leah , i asked you a question when i came into this room . '' \\n▁ mom commanded my attention . \\n▁ ` ` are you all right ? '' \\n▁ i turned to my mother and told her , ` ` i ' m fine . '' \\n▁ ` ` what happened ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` oh , not much , except i woke up but my dream was n't quite done with me yet . \\n▁ i had the highly disturbing experience of being hanged , literally , but without actually being hanged . '' \\n▁ every single one of my aunties gasped and even avery winced . \\n▁ lucien 's sharp voice cut cleanly through the horror filling the room . \\n▁ ` ` leah , a word . '' \\n▁ then he handed the martini shaker to avery and walked out . \\n▁ after the last incident that happened when i defied him in front of my aunties , i felt it prudent to follow him . \\n▁ he turned into the study and i followed him there too . \\n▁ he shut the door behind me , grabbed my upper arm and pushed me against it . \\n▁ i looked up to see he was angry . \\n▁ he did n't delay . \\n▁ ` ` you 're mother 's concerned . \\n▁ so concerned she flew across four states to check on you . \\n▁ you just told her something grisly , terrifying and life threatening happened to the daughter she loves like you 'd relay the time of day . '' \\n▁ ` ` please , do not think to tell me how to handle my own mother . '' \\n▁ i tried to make it as nice as i could . \\n▁ he might be the mighty vampire lucien everywhere else but he was treading on thin ice if he thought he could get between me and my family . \\n▁ he crowded me , dropping my arm and putting his hand on the door by my head . \\n▁ ` ` i see you need to learn respect for more than just me , pet , '' he said in a low , dangerous voice , clearly thinking he could get between me and my family . \\n▁ ` ` you have brothers ? \\n▁ sisters ? \\n▁ cousins ? '' \\n▁ i shot back and his eyes narrowed . \\n▁ ` ` what the f * * k does that - ? '' \\n▁ i cut him off before he could finish , ` ` no ? \\n▁ well then , you do n't understand what it means to be the black sheep in very close - knit family . \\n▁ they love me and i love them , like , a lot , but mostly , except aunt nadia , lana , my cousin natalie and sometimes my mom , they put up with me . \\n▁ i did n't want to come here . \\n▁ they made me . \\n▁ then they left me to deal with it all by myself with only edwina , stephanie and you to help me out . \\n▁ i did n't know any of you and you i did n't even like . '' \\n▁ his face lost some of its anger , not all , but there was a hint of concern -lrb- and , dare i believe it ? -rrb- \\n▁ even regret in his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i curtailed their communication with you , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` i figured that out in there , lucien , '' i informed him with a toss of my head toward the other room . \\n▁ ` ` but do you think , for even a minute , i would listen even to you if my sister lana needed me ? \\n▁ or natalie ? \\n▁ or mom ? \\n▁ or even aunt kate ? \\n▁ hunh ? \\n▁ do you ? '' \\n▁ his hand left the door and came to my neck . \\n▁ then his forehead came to rest on mine . \\n▁ then he muttered , ` ` not even a minute . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , not even a minute . \\n▁ i was drowning , lucien . \\n▁ i called out to them and they gave me no lifeline , just floated on their merry way . '' \\n▁ his other arm slid around me and he pulled me from the door into his warm , big , solid body . \\n▁ ` ` sweetheart , '' he whispered . \\n▁ yep , definitely regret . \\n▁ it was time to let him off the hook . \\n▁ what he did was uncool but it was very lucien . \\n▁ what they did was just , plain wrong . \\n▁ i looked up at him and put my hands on his chest . \\n▁ ` ` so , seeing as you 're new to the buchanan family dynamic , let me clue you in . \\n▁ i ' m going to go out there and be sarcastic , bitchy and obnoxious . \\n▁ aunt kate 's going to be overbearing because she 's never wrong . \\n▁ mom 's going to be guilty , as she should be . \\n▁ aunt millicent is going to be mostly worried about when dinner will be served . \\n▁ and aunt nadia and i 'll probably talk a lot about the clothes you bought me and whatever new man is in her life . \\n▁ then all will be forgiven . \\n▁ we 'll eat . \\n▁ we 'll probably get drunk . \\n▁ and , except for aunt kate , who will find the best guest room and lay claim to it before any of the rest of them even think about getting their suitcases from the car , we might end up dancing to eighties pop music and doing the robot . \\n▁ just hope aunt nadia does n't try to xxunk . \\n▁ the last time she did that she threw her back out and was down for a week . '' \\n▁ the regret was gone , his hand was moving up my back and his eyes were smiling even though his mouth was n't . \\n▁ ` ` two problems with the evening 's festivities , pet . '' \\n▁ ` ` and those would be ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want you drunk and i do n't want a house full of xxunk when i finally have you . '' \\n▁ oh . \\n▁ i 'd semi - forgotten about that . \\n▁ ` ` definitely no xxunk , '' he went on and because he was funny , i laughed out loud . \\n▁ when i did , his gaze dropped to my mouth , the smile left his eyes and they went intense . \\n▁ his hand sifted into the hair at the back of my head and he kissed the laughter right off my lips . \\n▁ it was a good kiss . \\n▁ one of the best in a lineup of seriously top - notch kisses . \\n▁ my arms were wrapped around his neck and my body was plastered against his when he lifted his head . \\n▁ when my thoughts xxunk , i whispered , ` ` we have a wee problem then . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , we do n't . '' \\n▁ i tilted my head to the side . \\n▁ ` ` we do n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` leave it to me . '' \\n▁ for some reason , i got worried and my arms tightened . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , i ' m not sure you understand . \\n▁ the buchanan women can be kind of … '' i could n't believe i was saying this to him of all people but i had to warn him as i would have to warn anyone who went head - to - head with the aunties , ` ` daunting when they 're riled . \\n▁ whatever they did made my dad leave and never come back and - '' lucien interrupted me , ` ` first , they 're concubines . \\n▁ i ' m a vampire . \\n▁ your father was n't . \\n▁ they wo n't say a single word to me . '' \\n▁ oh yes . \\n▁ that was true . \\n▁ he went on , ` ` second , your father left because of your aunts but he never came back because of cosmo . '' \\n▁ my arms tightened again , this time spasmodically because at the same time i felt like i 'd been kicked in the gut . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` if concubines find a man after their arrangement and wish to stop their care , they can ask their vampire to stop it . \\n▁ most of them do . \\n▁ your mother did too . \\n▁ but your father could n't give her the life cosmo gave her or the ones her sisters had . \\n▁ this made him mean . \\n▁ mean turned to nasty . \\n▁ drink made him dangerous . \\n▁ your aunts got rid of him , kate told cosmo about his behavior and cosmo reinstated your mother 's care and made certain he stayed gone . '' \\n▁ i stared at him , uncertain what to do with this knowledge . \\n▁ ` ` did cosmo … did he … kill my father ? '' \\n▁ lucien 's brows knitted . \\n▁ ` ` of course not . '' \\n▁ ` ` what 'd he do ? '' \\n▁ ` ` he gave him a very large sum of money . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open . \\n▁ my father vanished from my life because cosmo gave him money ? \\n▁ ` ` he , cosmo , dad … '' i stuttered , composed myself and then went on , ` ` cosmo made it so my father did n't even send me a birthday card , a graduation gift , a - ? '' \\n▁ ` ` cosmo made no stipulations about you girls . \\n▁ only lydia . \\n▁ your father chose to disappear from your life . '' \\n▁ this rocked me and my eyes moved to stare unseeing over his shoulder . \\n▁ what a schmuck ! \\n▁ of course , i already knew this but to have it confirmed totally stunk ! \\n▁ lucien 's arms gave me a gentle squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what a schmuck , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ my gaze returned to him and i declared , ` ` men suck . '' \\n▁ his lips turned up at the ends . \\n▁ ` ` not all men . '' \\n▁ i wrinkled my nose and then stated , ` ` no , you 're right . \\n▁ avery seems relatively nice . '' \\n▁ his arms gave me an affectionate squeeze this time but i did n't feel in the mood for affection . \\n▁ ` ` do you know everything about me ? '' \\n▁ i asked xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` not everything , no . \\n▁ but most things , yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not fair , '' i declared . \\n▁ his small grin got bigger . \\n▁ ` ` why 's that , pet ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know hardly anything about you . '' \\n▁ his hand twisted in my hair then started playing like we had all night and my aunties and avery were n't in the other room and edwina was n't blustering around in the kitchen in a dither at how to feed twice as many people as expected . \\n▁ ` ` what would you like to know ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked . \\n▁ i looked over my shoulder at the door mumbling , ` ` the aunties - '' another arm squeeze and i looked back at him . \\n▁ ` ` what would you like to know ? '' \\n▁ i had a million questions . \\n▁ no , a billion . \\n▁ enough where the aunties would have to find ways to amuse themselves and xxunk would no doubt commence . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , we have company . '' \\n▁ ` ` two questions , '' he returned . \\n▁ ` ` sorry ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` later you can ask me whatever you want . \\n▁ now , you 'll ask two questions . '' \\n▁ i stared at him and curiosity , as it had a way of doing , got the best of me . \\n▁ i started with , ` ` how old are you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` eight hundred and twenty - two . '' \\n▁ i felt my lips part and my eyes grow wide . \\n▁ the instant he caught my look , his eyes went hooded . \\n▁ ` ` wow , '' i breathed , ` ` you 're old . '' \\n▁ his eyes stayed hooded and he smiled , making it the sexiest smile i 'd ever seen in my life except the first one i witnessed from him at my selection the minute i clapped eyes on him when he heard me verbally drooling over how handsome he was . \\n▁ this one , however , was up close so it was even better . \\n▁ ` ` second question , '' he prompted , taking me out of my sexy smile reverie . \\n▁ i tried to decide . \\n▁ there were too many . \\n▁ then it came to me . \\n▁ ` ` how do you stop from hurting me ? '' \\n▁ his head cocked sharply to the side and he asked , ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you can throw a car , lucien , '' i said softly . \\n▁ ` ` how do you hug me and not crush my bones ? '' \\n▁ his hand slid through my hair then twisted back in it and he explained , ` ` it 's like speaking two languages from birth . \\n▁ it 's second nature . \\n▁ you can think , speak , read and write in them both . \\n▁ you just learn from the minute you 're born how to be a vampire and how to live in the mortal 's world . \\n▁ it 's rare i 'll lose control or any vampire will and it only happens when emotions are high , '' he paused , ` ` or when it 's deliberate . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's like you speak two body languages ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` fluently ? '' \\n▁ ` ` exactly like that , yes . '' \\n▁ i thought that was kind of cool . \\n▁ then something occurred to me that was seriously not cool and my heart skipped a beat . \\n▁ he heard it and called , ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ before i could lose my courage , i blurted , ` ` emotions are high when you have sex . '' \\n▁ his hand fisted in my hair , his other arm growing tighter . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he agreed . \\n▁ my breath caught , my body tensed then automatically i tried to draw away . \\n▁ his arm got even tighter and his face dipped closer . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll not hurt you . '' \\n▁ ` ` have you ever hurt anyone else ? '' \\n▁ ` ` never . '' \\n▁ ` ` you said that about the feeding , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' ` ` maybe we should - '' his face got even closer . \\n▁ ` ` no you do n't , '' he warned . \\n▁ ` ` i was a week without food when i lost control at your first feeding and you were far more excited than i could imagine . \\n▁ not than i could desire , but definitely than i could imagine , especially at that point in our relationship . '' \\n▁ this was highly embarrassing and even more highly annoying so i tried to cut him off . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' i failed at cutting him off . \\n▁ ` ` i was n't prepared . \\n▁ it wo n't happen tonight . '' \\n▁ i stared at him . \\n▁ for three weeks i knew he did n't go to feasts . \\n▁ if he did , he was a glutton . \\n▁ he fed morning and night and even would come home some afternoons . \\n▁ and , on top of that , the last time i thought he had sex with someone else , he said he could n't even though she tempted him . \\n▁ as far as i knew , he 'd been without for three weeks or longer . \\n▁ i 'd had lucien - induced orgasms . \\n▁ he 'd had nothing . \\n▁ if that was n't a recipe for disaster , nothing was ! \\n▁ ` ` what 's working behind your eyes now , pet ? '' \\n▁ he demanded , watching me closely , too closely . \\n▁ i looked over his shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` nothing , '' i lied . \\n▁ he gave me a shake . \\n▁ i looked back at him . \\n▁ ` ` seriously ! \\n▁ nothing ! '' \\n▁ his hand in my hair pulled my head back and his face got close . \\n▁ ` ` waking up every day after sleeping next to you , smelling you , feeling you , i take care of myself in the shower . \\n▁ in the beginning , during your punishment , i 'd have to do it two or three times a day . '' \\n▁ i stared up at him in shock and wonder and maybe a little turned on at his frank honesty but he saved the best for last . \\n▁ ` ` it 's been a long time , too long . \\n▁ it 'll be good to come inside you , sweetling . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ yes , totally turned on . \\n▁ before my brain kicked in , i whispered , ` ` can we kick the aunties out right now ? '' \\n▁ i saw the flash of his smug smile before he buried his face in my neck and muttered , ` ` you 're adorable . '' \\n▁ i was n't trying to be adorable . \\n▁ i was trying to get laid . \\n▁ ` ` no , seriously . '' \\n▁ his head came up and he touched his lips to mine . \\n▁ then he promised , ` ` soon , leah . '' \\n▁ his eyes went all vampire sexy and he whispered , ` ` very soon . '' \\n▁ my female parts rippled . \\n▁ he smiled like he knew it . \\n▁ and he probably did . \\n▁ i rolled my eyes . \\n▁ he burst out laughing . \\n▁ then he walked me out so i could be sarcastic , bitchy and obnoxious to my family . \\n▁ * * * * * i was padding on bare feet down the hall when i heard them . \\n▁ lucien 's ` ` very soon '' did n't come about because stephanie showed up during dessert . \\n▁ then lucien , avery and stephanie went behind closed doors in his study . \\n▁ while they were plotting whatever it was they were plotting , i sat and talked with mom and the aunties for a while . \\n▁ since lucien was hogging the study and the desktop computer was in the study , i had to go to the laptop upstairs to search online for someplace for my family to stay . \\n▁ lucien might not have been right about the ` ` very soon '' but he was right about my mom and aunties not giving him any xxunk when he told them they had to stay somewhere else . \\n▁ not a single word was spoken except aunt millicent asking , ` ` could someone pass the potatoes ? '' \\n▁ luckily , dragon lake was a picturesque town so there were tons of posh bed and breakfasts . \\n▁ unfortunately , most of them were booked up . \\n▁ i lucked out on the seventh call when i found a place that not only was a bandb but also had a big guest house which had a cancellation . \\n▁ i booked them in and was heading toward the comfy seating area in the kitchen where they were all gabbing -lrb- seriously , that huge house and we used , like , four rooms , it was such a freaking waste -rrb- when i heard them . \\n▁ ` ` lifemates ? '' \\n▁ my mother cried in a weird strangled voice that sounded both thrilled beyond belief and scared stupid . \\n▁ at her words , i stopped dead . \\n▁ i thought they were talking about lucien and katrina and i felt like a knife had been plunged in my gut . \\n▁ i had n't exactly forgotten about her but i had also not let myself think about her . \\n▁ lucien had moved on from her that much was clear . \\n▁ what was n't clear was how i felt about how easily he could leave what amounted to his wife of fifty years and carry on with another woman , namely , me . \\n▁ ` ` what else could it be ? '' \\n▁ aunt nadia replied to my mother . \\n▁ ` ` there 's no such thing as lifemates . \\n▁ that 's romance novel balderdash , '' aunt kate proclaimed . \\n▁ ` ` sounds fishy to me too , '' aunt millicent agreed . \\n▁ ` ` well , it does n't sound fishy to me . \\n▁ she 's marking him and only lucien can do that . \\n▁ she can talk to him with her mind . \\n▁ that 's never happened , not from a mortal . \\n▁ and she 's dreaming about the sentence , '' aunt nadia said . \\n▁ the sentence ? \\n▁ what on earth was that ? \\n▁ i moved to the wall to better hide myself and decided to full on eavesdrop since they were n't talking about katrina , they were talking about me . \\n▁ me being lifemates with lucien . \\n▁ i read romance novels , loads of them , and lifemates were what some of those books called the unions between immortals or mortals and immortals . \\n▁ the concept was , there was one being on all the earth through all of time that belonged to the immortal . \\n▁ she was destined for him -lrb- it was usually a him -rrb- even so far as created for him . \\n▁ and of all the millions and billions of beings on the planet through time , he had to find her . \\n▁ through all his centuries and sometimes millennia of living , he had to search out his one true love , the other half of him and bind himself to her . \\n▁ of course , he found her . \\n▁ they usually had lots of hot sex . \\n▁ though how they got to the sex when all the rest of the time they were bickering or there was some huge misunderstanding or they had to fight against some grave evil or he 'd done her some wrong for which she hated him , i 'd never know . \\n▁ still , it worked . \\n▁ eventually she soothed his savage soul , he 'd find some way to make her immortal if she already was n't and they lived happily ever after for eternity . \\n▁ aunt kate was right . \\n▁ balderdash . \\n▁ ` ` what do you think , avery ? '' \\n▁ my mother asked and my eyes went to the study door which , i noticed belatedly , was open and no one was inside . \\n▁ where was lucien ? \\n▁ ` ` i think i 'll respectfully decline participation in this conversation , '' avery murmured . \\n▁ ` ` oh come on avery . \\n▁ you have to speak up , '' aunt nadia urged . \\n▁ ` ` mortals do n't have those powers . \\n▁ leah did n't even have those powers until she met lucien . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 'd had the dreams , '' aunt millicent pointed out . \\n▁ ` ` okay , she had the dreams , '' aunt nadia allowed . \\n▁ ` ` but the rest ? \\n▁ it 's crazy ! \\n▁ sounds total lifemate to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` can you imagine ? \\n▁ my leah , lifemate to the great lucien . \\n▁ she 's already famous but she 'll be a legend . '' \\n▁ mom sounded ecstatic . \\n▁ i was famous ? \\n▁ i did n't have time to ponder my celebrity , aunt kate spoke . \\n▁ ` ` i hope you jest , lydia . \\n▁ i hope to god you jest , '' aunt kate whispered but her whisper was strange . \\n▁ it was angry and it was afraid . \\n▁ ` ` katie - '' aunt nadia started . \\n▁ ` ` you 'd wish that on your daughter , to build a legend ? '' \\n▁ aunt kate hissed . \\n▁ there was silence . \\n▁ then mom replied , ` ` kate , i just want to see leah happy . '' \\n▁ ` ` happy for what ? \\n▁ a few years ? \\n▁ until they cotton on , they hunt them down , they torture them and they hand down the sentence ? '' \\n▁ ` ` kate - '' avery said gently . \\n▁ ` ` no , avery , no , '' aunt kate cut him off . \\n▁ ` ` if such a fool thing as lifemates exists and if leah is lucien 's lifemate , i hope she does n't figure it out . \\n▁ and i especially hope he does n't . \\n▁ there is no way the great lucien will denounce her . \\n▁ not ever . \\n▁ and leah 's so stubborn , she would n't denounce him either . \\n▁ he 'd burn and while he did he and the rest of us would watch her swing . '' \\n▁ my breath stuck in my throat , stars exploded in my eyes and i thought i might faint . \\n▁ my dream , the heat i felt , the noose around my neck , lucien telling me he was in it . \\n▁ was that what it was ? \\n▁ a premonition of this sentence thing ? \\n▁ lucien burning . \\n▁ me swinging ! \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ ` ` for a month , lydia , '' aunt kate went on , ` ` you and nadia , lana , natalie , kendra , melissa , you ' ve all been after me to let you speak to leah , to let you disobey the wishes of a vampire to make sure she 's all right . \\n▁ and now you want her life to be at risk ? '' \\n▁ they wanted to speak to me ? \\n▁ even kendra ? \\n▁ my cousin kendra and i fought before i left because she could n't find that kickass belt i loved so much that i wanted to bring with me but i 'd lent to her . \\n▁ she was always losing my stuff -lrb- like my kickass belt -rrb- . \\n▁ why i let her borrow it , i 'd never know . \\n▁ ` ` do you think lucien would let anything happen to leah ? '' \\n▁ mom asked , sounding uppity and taking me out of my thoughts about my belt . \\n▁ ` ` you saw them when we walked in . \\n▁ have you ever , once , seen lucien laugh ? '' \\n▁ more silence . \\n▁ i guess they had n't . \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ mom went on , ` ` we agreed to this because this is bigger than all of us . \\n▁ this is huge . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and this is about leah , '' aunt kate returned . \\n▁ ` ` the reason i did n't allow you to go against lucien was because i had every faith leah would have the exact effect on lucien that we witnessed when we walked in . \\n▁ she 's the best of the lot of us . \\n▁ she 's a true buchanan . \\n▁ she 's a buchanan of old . '' \\n▁ at those words , uttered by aunt kate no less -lrb- i always thought she thought i was a big , crazy loon -rrb- , i felt my chest get tight and i had to put my hand to the wall to hold myself standing . \\n▁ it was aunt millicent who spoke next and she did so softly . \\n▁ ` ` let her work her magic , lydia . \\n▁ she 's got the strength to see this through at lucien 's side to however it ends . \\n▁ no other concubine i know , living or dead , has that same strength . \\n▁ but lifemates , which is a ridiculous notion nadia , even for you , do n't even consider it . \\n▁ and definitely do n't put that idea in leah 's head . \\n▁ she 'd run and lucien would have no choice now he 's come this far , to hunt her . '' \\n▁ more silence . \\n▁ more swirling in my head . \\n▁ finally aunt nadia muttered , ` ` i still want them to be lifemates . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , for heaven 's sake , why ? '' \\n▁ aunt millicent snapped . \\n▁ ` ` because , you and katie are right , this is leah , '' aunt nadia snapped back . \\n▁ ` ` and she 's special . \\n▁ we ' ve always known that . \\n▁ and i 'd rather her have however long lucien can give her of something beautiful before the dominion puts a stop to it , if they can defeat lucien at all , then for her to be set aside like the rest of us . '' \\n▁ at that i backed away slowly , carefully , not making a noise . \\n▁ my heart was racing , my eyes were stinging , my stomach hurt and my head was filled with loads of junk none of which i could sort . \\n▁ i really , really , really needed to talk to stephanie . \\n▁ or maybe edwina because i had the sneaking suspicion she knew more about everything than she let on . \\n▁ or even , possibly , avery . \\n▁ i turned and walked up five steps , shutting out their murmurs while deep breathing . \\n▁ when i had myself under control , i bounded down , shouting , ` ` found you guys a guest house ! '' \\n▁ their murmurs stopped . \\n▁ i sauntered in like i 'd heard nothing . \\n▁ ` ` that 's great , honey , '' mom , sitting on the couch , said and since i was close to her , she grabbed my hand . \\n▁ she gave my hand a squeeze . \\n▁ i gave her a squeeze back . \\n▁ ` ` are you still xxunk me ? '' \\n▁ she asked , giving me a cheeky grin because she knew my answer . \\n▁ i had , of course , in my efforts at being sarcastic , bitchy and obnoxious , told my mother i disowned her . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't decided , '' i replied but she knew i was n't serious . \\n▁ she gave me another hand squeeze . \\n▁ i saw movement outside and looked out the windows . \\n▁ one wall of the kitchen was made of floor - to - ceiling windows making the indoors seem kind of outdoors , which was really cool . \\n▁ and i saw lucien and stephanie stroll out of the woods . \\n▁ so stephanie and lucien had gone for a stroll which was why he could n't hear my family 's mind - boggling , earth - shattering , leah 's place in the family and all her foundations and everything she ever thought about life herself and the world as she knew it rocking conversation . \\n▁ they were walking slowly even for mortals and i watched lucien 's body move . \\n▁ it was a sight to behold . \\n▁ even walking slowly across a yard , he looked imposing . \\n▁ not like he was walking across a yard but as if he was strolling broodingly across a battlefield , pre - battle . \\n▁ a battle he 'd eventually win , of course , soundly . \\n▁ as i had this thought , his head came up , and he looked right at me . \\n▁ i hoped he did n't hear my thoughts . \\n▁ then his lips tipped up in that sexy way of his . \\n▁ not smug or arrogant , just smiling at me . \\n▁ he did n't hear me . \\n▁ i smiled back . \\n▁ then i felt something strange and i looked toward its source and saw avery was watching me musingly . \\n▁ and somehow i knew that he knew i 'd heard every word of the earlier conversation . \\n▁ but it was something else . \\n▁ and that something else was somewhere i did not want to go . \\n▁ i wrinkled my nose at him and he grinned . \\n▁ lucien and stephanie walked in . \\n▁ i went to sit down on the arm of the couch next to aunt kate which , incidentally , had the added benefit of being closer to lucien . \\n▁ then , i could n't help myself , i bent and kissed the top of aunt kate 's head . \\n▁ ` ` what on earth ! '' \\n▁ she batted around her head , her hands getting nowhere near me . \\n▁ aunt kate , by the way , hated public displays of affection or affection at all for that matter . \\n▁ ` ` what 's the matter with you , leah buchanan ? '' \\n▁ she snapped . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m trying to find new and interesting ways to annoy you , '' i informed her . \\n▁ ` ` well , you found one , '' she retorted . \\n▁ ` ` good , '' i returned . \\n▁ ` ` next i ' m going to force you to cuddle with me and a tub of ice cream and tell me about all your secret crushes as a teenager , '' i hesitated and finished , ` ` in minute detail . '' \\n▁ aunt nadia , aunt millicent and mom giggled . \\n▁ stephanie out - and - out laughed and i heard avery 's chuckle . \\n▁ aunt kate stood and announced , ` ` we ' ve a guest house to check into . \\n▁ ladies , we 're going . '' \\n▁ the rest of my family and also avery and stephanie made their moves to leave . \\n▁ nicely done , pet , lucien said to my brain . \\n▁ i looked at him . \\n▁ he looked amused and hungry and very , very sexy . \\n▁ my heart skipped a beat . \\n▁ i had n't actually kissed aunt kate to piss her off enough to leave and drag everyone with her . \\n▁ but at that moment , i also was n't upset to see them go . \\n▁ chapter seventeen the joining three weeks ago , lucien came home and gave me a black - colored credit card , a checkbook and a bank card the credit card , he told me , was for my use whenever i wanted , whatever i wanted . \\n▁ the bills would go to him . \\n▁ the checking account , he told me , had its first deposit . \\n▁ the same amount would be deposited every month and that was for my use whenever i wanted , whatever i wanted when cash was required . \\n▁ when he left me , i looked and the amount of the deposit was a quarter of my yearly salary . \\n▁ it was the kind of thing dreams were made of , if you did n't hate the person who made that dream come true as , at the time , i hated lucien . \\n▁ two weeks ago , stephanie came over one morning and told me we were having a girlie day . \\n▁ then she whisked me off to a spa , we had facials and massages and then sat in a sauna where , incidentally , her super - vampire senses came in handy because all that steam made me blind . \\n▁ i tripped over the wooden mat by the door and she caught me before i took a header . \\n▁ then we had a gourmet lunch followed by manicures , pedicures , makeup and hair . \\n▁ then we went shopping and she took me to the place where she bought the outfit i admired so much . \\n▁ and she also took me to a place that sold lingerie that cost more than most people 's monthly mortgage payments . \\n▁ it was there that she made me -lrb- and she did make me , i did n't want to do it -rrb- buy the getup that i was wearing at that very moment . \\n▁ she heard my heart start racing when i eyed it in the shop , she forced me to try it on and then she vampire - talked me , as in no protesting allowed , into buying it . \\n▁ now i was standing in front of the three - way mirror in the dressing room and examining myself . \\n▁ i had to admit , i loved it . \\n▁ it was kind of naughty but it was also cute . \\n▁ the problem was i did n't know if lucien would like it . \\n▁ it was a camisole and panties in sheer baby pink . \\n▁ the camisole was xxunk from under the br * * sts , the cups had rows of tiny , black lace frills that ran at xxunk . \\n▁ the thin straps were made of baby pink satin and there was a little black frill around the hem . \\n▁ the panties were also sheer baby pink but they were covered in rows of tiny , black lace frills , like little girl panties . \\n▁ very sexy . \\n▁ very sweet . \\n▁ very cute . \\n▁ but definitely kind of naughty . \\n▁ i fancied i heard a noise , jumped like the scaredy - cat i was and ran to the black silk man 's tailored robe that came down to my knees that i also bought at that store . \\n▁ both purchases cost more than my food budget for six months when i was at home . \\n▁ lucien was going to have a conniption when he got the credit card bill . \\n▁ i covered up , tugged the belt tight on the robe and wondered if i should put on lip gloss . \\n▁ then i decided that was a supremely stupid idea since i was , essentially , going to bed . \\n▁ i took a deep , ragged breath , walked out of the dressing room through the bathroom and into the bedroom . \\n▁ lucien was laying in bed , back to the headboard , covers up to his waist , gorgeous chest bared . \\n▁ he was reading a book . \\n▁ i stopped and stared . \\n▁ his eyes came to me . \\n▁ i fought back the need to start panting . \\n▁ to hide my distress , i latched onto something else . \\n▁ that something else was the fact that he was lying in bed reading and he was xxunk blank eight hundred and twenty - two years old . \\n▁ ` ` after eight hundred years plus , have n't you already read every book ever published ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ his thumb holding his place , he dropped the book to his side . \\n▁ then he answered , ` ` no . '' \\n▁ hmm . \\n▁ next question . \\n▁ ` ` do vampires ever get so old they have to wear glasses ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` hearing aids ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` dentures ? '' \\n▁ i went on stupidly and , maybe , semi - hysterically . \\n▁ his lips turned up at the ends . \\n▁ ` ` no , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` do they ever have to walk with canes ? '' \\n▁ the lip - turn morphed into a sexy smile . \\n▁ ` ` come here , sweetheart , '' he ordered gently . \\n▁ seeing as , if i decided to make a run for it , he could be on me faster than i could blink , i thought it best to do as he ordered . \\n▁ as i walked toward him , he put his book on the nightstand . \\n▁ i stopped at the side of the bed . \\n▁ with vamp speed he twisted , grabbed me by the waist , slid down the bed and i was on top of him over the covers . \\n▁ i arched my back and rested a forearm on his chest , catching my breath at his sudden movements . \\n▁ he gathered all my hair in both of his hands at the back of my neck and his eyes caught mine . \\n▁ ` ` nervous ? '' \\n▁ he murmured . \\n▁ nervous ? \\n▁ no . \\n▁ about to have a cardiac arrest ? \\n▁ yes ! \\n▁ ` ` no , '' i lied to save face . \\n▁ he grinned and told me , ` ` i can hear your heart , pet . '' \\n▁ why was i always forgetting that ? \\n▁ i wrinkled my nose and informed him , ` ` you 're very annoying . '' \\n▁ he put pressure on my neck , enough for my arm to buckle and get trapped between us as he lifted his head and buried it in my neck . \\n▁ ` ` you 're very adorable , '' he replied against my skin . \\n▁ i was pretty certain my heart was accelerating past the point of cardiac arrest straight to cardiac explosion . \\n▁ regardless of this fact , since i was me , i retorted , ` ` that 's part of you being annoying . '' \\n▁ his lips slid up the side of my neck and i did a full body tremble . \\n▁ ` ` what is ? '' \\n▁ he asked the underside of my jaw . \\n▁ ` ` you calling me adorable , '' i answered , tilting my head back to give him better access . \\n▁ i felt his smile . \\n▁ then i felt the tip of his tongue move along my jaw and then down my throat . \\n▁ i held my breath while he did this and my female parts rippled . \\n▁ ` ` are you going to feed ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he answered . \\n▁ this surprised me . \\n▁ he had n't fed that night except on roast chicken , stuffing , potatoes , rolls and edwina 's whipped up at the last minute strawberry pie . \\n▁ ` ` you 're not ? '' \\n▁ one of his hands slid up to cup the back of my head , the other one glided down my back . \\n▁ he guided my mouth to his and touched his lips to mine . \\n▁ eyes holding mine captive , he replied , ` ` if i feed , the numbing agent will release . \\n▁ i do n't want any part of you numbed with what i do with my mouth tonight . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ another full body tremble , female parts ripple and goose bumps formed on my flesh . \\n▁ he felt it , he knew it , he grinned his smug grin and then he kissed me . \\n▁ it was n't a claiming onslaught . \\n▁ it was n't a wild , ravenous duel . \\n▁ it was sweet and soft , coaxing and discovering , a new kind of kiss that was quite like our first one but a whole lot better . \\n▁ my body melted into his and i kissed him back . \\n▁ his hand at my back slid over my bottom , down my thigh and then started to bunch the robe in his fist . \\n▁ from somewhere far away , my naughty - girl undies popped right into my head and i jerked straight up to straddling him . \\n▁ he allowed this , why , i did n't know . \\n▁ he just laid there looking up at me , his eyes alert but not angry , his hand now caught in the crease of my leg , his other hand coming to rest on my other thigh . \\n▁ i stared down at him thinking one thing . \\n▁ i needed to change clothes . \\n▁ like , now . \\n▁ ` ` there 's something i forgot , '' i muttered . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' i prepared to move and while i took the nanosecond to do this both his hands settled firmly on my hips . \\n▁ ` ` leah , you are n't going anywhere . '' \\n▁ i was mentally xxunk my lingerie drawer -lrb- he 'd filled it full himself , he had to like those things , he bought them ! -rrb- \\n▁ , when i replied , ` ` this wo n't take a second . '' \\n▁ his hands tensed , his face gentled , his eyes grew warm just as his voice dipped low , a killer combination . \\n▁ ` ` sweetling , there 's nothing on this planet you have to worry about right now . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' his hands slid up my sides at the same time putting on pressure to pull me toward him . \\n▁ ` ` just relax , '' he muttered . \\n▁ my mind searched wildly for ways to delay . \\n▁ ` ` can i. . . ? '' \\n▁ i muttered , coming up with nothing as his face got closer . \\n▁ ` ` can i. . . ? '' \\n▁ i repeated stupidly . \\n▁ then it came to me . \\n▁ ` ` will you let me … explore ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ the pressure stopped . \\n▁ thank god . \\n▁ his hands drifted down my sides , my waist , my h * ps to come to rest on the tops of my thighs . \\n▁ ` ` by all means , '' he murmured , my heart skipped , his eyes had gone hooded and now i was really in trouble . \\n▁ since i 'd been really in trouble before like , lots , as usual , i just winged it . \\n▁ and , anyway , his chest was right there . \\n▁ and i 'd never really touched him before . \\n▁ he touched me but i 'd never got the chance to have a go at him . \\n▁ i took my chance . \\n▁ i lifted up to straddling again and , using my fingertips , i explored . \\n▁ drifting softly as my eyes followed my movements , i touched all the planes and angles of his chest , his abdomen , brushing my fingers across the top of the bedclothes under his navel . \\n▁ i discovered he felt good . \\n▁ his skin was soft , his muscles hard . \\n▁ the angles fascinated me . \\n▁ the planes fascinated me more . \\n▁ i lost myself so much , it came as a surprise when he took in a sharp breath and his fingers tensed on my thighs as i ran the pad of my thumb across his nipple . \\n▁ my eyes flew to his and his were intense , so intense they were blazing . \\n▁ for the first time since i met him , i felt power . \\n▁ and i liked it . \\n▁ i liked it so much , i could n't stop my smile . \\n▁ totally forgetting my lingerie , i bent at the waist . \\n▁ i followed the trail my fingertips had made , this time with my mouth , often my tongue , tasting him . \\n▁ his skin tasted just as delicious as his kisses . \\n▁ my lips slid across his nipple then my tongue did the same then i swept the front edge of my teeth against it . \\n▁ suddenly , he knifed to sitting , his hands no longer at my thighs , they were yanking at the belt of my robe . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not done exploring , '' i protested . \\n▁ looking in my eyes , he tugged the robe off my shoulders and tossed it aside . \\n▁ then his hand fisted in my hair and he steered my mouth to his . \\n▁ ` ` you can explore all you want when we 're both naked . '' \\n▁ his voice was a low , sexy rumble . \\n▁ i had no chance to speak further . \\n▁ he kissed me , hungry , even needy , and demanding . \\n▁ so demanding it rocked me , my arms circled him for i had no choice but to hold on . \\n▁ i was dazed , trembling and feeling ripples everywhere when his mouth tore from mine , he leaned a bit back , his hands at my camisole and he stilled . \\n▁ then , eyes on my middle , in what could only be described as a raw groan , he growled , ` ` jesus leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i breathed then i remembered and i stilled too . \\n▁ damn ! \\n▁ he did n't like my naughty - girl undies . \\n▁ his hand went into my hair , twisting and fisting and he used it to bring my face close to his . \\n▁ his eyes were burning . \\n▁ i quit breathing . \\n▁ then he ground out , ` ` leave it to you to wear something i want to f * * k you in when i ' ve been fantasizing for twenty years of f * * king you wearing nothing at all . '' \\n▁ okay , maybe i was wrong . \\n▁ one could say he liked the lingerie . \\n▁ good to know . \\n▁ ` ` is this our only shot ? '' \\n▁ i asked , still dazed and now slightly confused . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` are we only ha * * ng s * x once ? '' \\n▁ ` ` fuck no , '' he clipped . \\n▁ ` ` then ca n't you do both … eventually ? '' \\n▁ i 'd barely uttered the ` ` ly '' in ` ` eventually '' when i was flying through the air , landing on my back . \\n▁ before his mouth took mine in another hungry , demanding kiss , i guessed i had my answer . \\n▁ i learned very quickly that lucien had n't only used his eight hundred plus years on this earth to become a master with his hands and mouth . \\n▁ lucien had used those years to become a master at everything . \\n▁ he also used the lingerie to his advantage . \\n▁ his mouth did the same on me as mine did on him but trailing the edge of the camisole at my br * * sts , pushing the xxunk up and gliding his lips and tongue across my midriff and belly , tracing the edge of my panties then up . \\n▁ over the frills , i felt his tongue dart aggressively against my rock hard nipple then again and again before he sucked it into his mouth over the fabric . \\n▁ when he did , it felt so freaking fantastic , i moaned for a very long time . \\n▁ not done , he tugged the fabric down so it dragged across my sensitive nipple in a sexy way that made me whimper before his mouth locked on my nipple and he drew it in sharply . \\n▁ vampires understood suction like no one else . \\n▁ it was sheer ecstasy . \\n▁ after a while , he did this to the other nipple too . \\n▁ i was paying attention , of course , lots of attention . \\n▁ but i was also busy moaning and writhing and gripping his hair to hold him to me . \\n▁ i was so turned on i thought i 'd have an orgasm just by what he did to my ni * * les . \\n▁ but i wanted more . \\n▁ i pushed off on a foot , rolling him to his back . \\n▁ he let me do this , his arms sliding around me , crushing me to him for another wet , hot , demanding kiss . \\n▁ ` ` my turn , '' i whispered against his lips when he ended the kiss . \\n▁ before he could say a word , my lips went down his throat , down his chest and down his stomach , pushing the bedclothes lower and exposing him . \\n▁ he was thick , rock hard and looked utterly delectable . \\n▁ i could not wait to explore . \\n▁ i wrapped my hand around him , thrilling when i heard him suck in a sharp breath . \\n▁ i no sooner twirled the tip of him with my tongue when he bent double . \\n▁ he wrapped an arm around my waist and yanked my body around so i was facing his lap but my knees were in the bed beside his shoulder as he lay back . \\n▁ i looked at him in question and his eyes were on me . \\n▁ ` ` enjoy , pet , '' he murmured his encouragement , his voice resonating deep and i did n't know how long my shot would last so i did n't hesitate further . \\n▁ i enjoyed . \\n▁ a couple minutes into my enjoyment , his hand went between my legs , stroking my inner thighs , gliding along the edges of my naughty - girl panties between my legs and over the swells of my bottom , his touch whisper soft . \\n▁ this felt really , really nice . \\n▁ so nice , i slid my legs wider to give him better access . \\n▁ and so nice i wanted to give lucien something really nice too . \\n▁ i stopped licking and stroking and slid the tip of him between my lips . \\n▁ when i did , his hand moved , delving into my panties , filling me with his finger just as his h * ps bucked , filling my mouth with him . \\n▁ it was divine . \\n▁ he tasted good there too . \\n▁ luscious . \\n▁ i groaned and immediately got greedy . \\n▁ he pulled my undies down to my thighs and he played with me while his h * ps jerked into my mouth as deep as he could go . \\n▁ it was unbelievably hot . \\n▁ too hot . \\n▁ i lost my concentration and drew back , wrapping a fist around him , thumb absently circling the tip . \\n▁ i arched my back which pressed my chest into his belly and threw my head back , my hair flying over my shoulders and drifting across his abs . \\n▁ all i could do was focus on what was happening between my legs . \\n▁ and what was happening between my legs was the makings of an orgasm so cataclysmic , i was n't certain i would survive it . \\n▁ whimpers of pleasure sounding from low in my throat , i spread my legs further , ground my h * ps into his hand and regardless of my uncertain survival , i sought more . \\n▁ his fingers stopped swirling and thrusting and disappeared . \\n▁ before i could react to this sudden loss , he swept an arm behind my knees and i was on my back , my panties were gone , his h * ps were between my thighs and his weight was pinning me to the bed . \\n▁ i felt the tip of him enter me . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i breathed , wrapping my arms around him . \\n▁ i closed my eyes , so freaking ready , i would have begged him without hesitation . \\n▁ his hands came down the backs of my thighs , he pulled them up at the knees and slid in a centimeter deeper . \\n▁ i arched my neck . \\n▁ ` ` look at me , sweetling . '' \\n▁ his voice was a deep , aroused rumble that moved across my skin like a touch . \\n▁ it took some effort but i looked at him . \\n▁ i thought i knew what he wanted and immediately i whispered , ` ` please , lucien . '' \\n▁ his eyes went dark , his face got close and he framed mine with his big hands . \\n▁ ` ` that 's beautiful , leah , but i do n't want you to beg . '' \\n▁ my body moving on its own , desperate for release , desperate for him , i pressed my h * ps into his but he withheld . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he gritted between his teeth , clearly seeking control , ` ` before the joining , you need to answer one question . '' \\n▁ i nodded , too far gone to do much else . \\n▁ his lips came to mine , his eyes still open , in his rumbly voice that now seemed even more intense , he asked , ` ` are you mine ? '' \\n▁ my body stilled . \\n▁ this was it . \\n▁ i had to make a choice and once i did there was no going back . \\n▁ the answer came to me , the only one there was . \\n▁ my arms held on tight just as my legs circled his h * ps and did the same . \\n▁ ` ` if you give me you , lucien , then i promise , i 'll give you me . '' \\n▁ i watched close up as his eyes flashed . \\n▁ then he drove in deep . \\n▁ i arched my neck in pleasure and cried out as it mingled with a hint of pain . \\n▁ seated to the hilt , he filled me completely . \\n▁ he was so big , i had no idea how i accommodated him . \\n▁ it did n't matter . \\n▁ it was so beautiful to be joined to him , connected to him , filled by him , i welcomed the pain . \\n▁ ` ` you have me , leah , '' he murmured in my ear and he was not wrong . \\n▁ i had him , all of him or , likely , all that i ever was really going to get . \\n▁ i knew this and at that moment i could n't bring myself to care . \\n▁ because all of lucien , what filled me , what pinned me to the bed and everything else that he 'd gifted me with this past month was far , far more than i 'd ever had from anyone else . \\n▁ i twisted my head to look at him , my arms and legs tightened and i whispered , ` ` then i ' m yours , lucien . '' \\n▁ at my words , his mouth took mine in a hungry , dueling kiss and he started moving . \\n▁ it was gorgeous . \\n▁ while driving deep , his thrusts opening me , widening me , filling me full again and again and again and again , the pressure built , excruciating and fantastic . \\n▁ cataclysmic was the word for it . \\n▁ i was rocking underneath him , lifting my knees , giving him more , taking more from him , insatiable , the pressure building , becoming unbearable , ripping through me . \\n▁ his lips released mine , his hand went into my hair , tugging my head back . \\n▁ then his mouth went to my neck and i felt his tongue . \\n▁ then i felt him feeding . \\n▁ i felt my blood flow into his mouth , pouring out with each deep , savage thrust . \\n▁ once , twice , three times , four . \\n▁ then suddenly i hit paradise and came . \\n▁ and i came hard , wrapping him as tight as i could in my convulsing limbs and forgetting everything but lucien , his heavy body , his scent , the feel of him , his mouth at my neck , my blood nourishing him while i felt him plunging deep inside . \\n▁ there had never been better and there never would be . \\n▁ maybe not only in my life but in the history of xxunk . \\n▁ i was sliding down the wave , my body still jolted by his thrusts , small , contented whimpers escaping my lips when his tongue swept my neck , his mouth claimed mine and his tongue drove inside so i could taste myself on him . \\n▁ the taste of me on his tongue enhanced the intimacy in an xxunk profound way that shattered my soul . \\n▁ then he slammed inside me until he was seated full to the root and i felt his body spasm powerfully , shaking me with him as his deep groan filled my mouth . \\n▁ his orgasm , and the depth of it , caused a sense of triumphant elation so powerful , it felt like it shredded me straight through to my core . \\n▁ shredded , shattered , sated and moved beyond anything i could imagine by the splendor of our joining , uncharacteristically of me i did n't fight the feeling . \\n▁ i drew it in , pulled it close , held it safe and i wrapped my limbs even tighter around my vampire . \\n▁ * * * * * my eyes opened when lucien set me in bed . \\n▁ i saw the sun peeking weakly through the curtains . \\n▁ it was nearly morning . \\n▁ i 'd been dozing or , more accurately , passed out . \\n▁ he slid in behind me , his arm curling around my waist , pulling me to his heat , holding me close . \\n▁ i settled against him . \\n▁ after the first time , we 'd done it four more times . \\n▁ four . \\n▁ more . \\n▁ times . \\n▁ that was five , in total . \\n▁ the first was by far and away the best but it was up for grabs which reigned supreme of the other four . \\n▁ i could likely argue in favor -lrb- for hours -rrb- for all of them . \\n▁ the last time was on the couch in the comfy seating area off the kitchen . \\n▁ we 'd gone down to raid the fridge . \\n▁ or i had , i was starved . \\n▁ lucien had been feeding a lot , he could n't be hungry . \\n▁ and we got sidetracked . \\n▁ it was the first time he let me be on top . \\n▁ after we were done , still joined , i rested my torso on his wide chest , burrowed my face into his neck and fell fast asleep . \\n▁ i did n't know how long ago that was . \\n▁ it could have been minutes or it could have been hours . \\n▁ now i was awake and , out of nowhere , it hit me . \\n▁ and it felt like i 'd been struck by lightning . \\n▁ lucien 's behavior was not about making me cow to him , to submit , to change , to be something he wanted to force me to be . \\n▁ he 'd said and demonstrated more than once that he always wanted me . \\n▁ just me . \\n▁ it was about me submitting to what he was . \\n▁ i had to accept him , in all his bossy , domineering vampire - ness and the other sweet or gentle or generous parts besides . \\n▁ he was n't taming me . \\n▁ he was taming that part in me that held me away from his xxunk . \\n▁ he was showing me who he was , what he was , how he behaved and i had to accept it , all of it , without him being anything but lucien . \\n▁ you live your day - to - day life hiding the essence of who you are ; you do n't want to let someone into that life who wo n't accept you for that same thing . \\n▁ even embrace it . \\n▁ even rejoice in the beauty of it . \\n▁ i felt tears fill my eyes . \\n▁ i was such a moron ! \\n▁ ` ` sweetheart ? '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ could he hear tears ? \\n▁ that would suck ! \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i asked and i was pleased my voice sounded normal . \\n▁ ` ` you are n't asleep . '' \\n▁ ` ` um … '' i could n't answer . \\n▁ i was busy trying to control my tears and i succeeded but just barely . \\n▁ ` ` is there something on your mind ? '' \\n▁ he queried gently . \\n▁ yes , many things were on my mind . \\n▁ weighty things . \\n▁ ayers rock style weight or at least it felt like it . \\n▁ ` ` not really , '' i lied . \\n▁ his arm grew tight . \\n▁ ` ` you can sleep , leah . \\n▁ what happened last night wo n't happen again . '' \\n▁ he thought i was worried about my dream . \\n▁ i was n't worried about my dream . \\n▁ though , now that he brought it up . \\n▁ ` ` how do you know ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m here , '' he answered . \\n▁ all right , so i pretty much believed that lucien was big enough , bad enough , fast enough and strong enough to kick anyone 's ass but a xxunk dream that mysteriously hangs its victim ? \\n▁ i was thinking even he could n't beat that . \\n▁ i made a decision . \\n▁ it was a scary decision but i made it and seeing as i was so freaking stubborn , once made i 'd see it through , no matter that it scared the heck out of me . \\n▁ ` ` are you tired ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , pet . '' \\n▁ i felt his face move into my hair before he muttered , all vampire sexy , ` ` i ' m very tired . '' \\n▁ oh . \\n▁ well then . \\n▁ maybe i could n't see it through . \\n▁ knowing i 'd tired out the mighty vampire lucien with all our sexual antics and thinking that was pretty cool thus being pretty pleased with myself , i decided i did n't care . \\n▁ he went on , ` ` but if you wish to talk … '' as was my way , instantly , i changed my mind -lrb- again -rrb- and took my shot . \\n▁ i turned in his arms so i was facing him . \\n▁ it was time to get some questions answered . \\n▁ i started with one that might not freak me out -lrb- much -rrb- . \\n▁ ` ` am i famous ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ he asked back , seeming surprised by my question . \\n▁ i explained , ` ` everyone i meet when i ' m with you seems to know me . \\n▁ even at the selection people were looking at me like they knew me or at least were curious about me so they knew of me . '' \\n▁ ` ` most members of a concubine family are known by vampires , leah . '' \\n▁ i studied him . \\n▁ he was so holding back . \\n▁ ` ` not like me , '' i whispered my challenge . \\n▁ he blew out a sigh then curled me closer . \\n▁ ` ` no , my pet , not like you . '' \\n▁ i knew it ! \\n▁ ` ` why not like me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because of me . '' \\n▁ i held my breath . \\n▁ i did n't know why , i just did . \\n▁ i heard his chuckle . \\n▁ ` ` you can breathe , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ i breathed . \\n▁ then i wrinkled my nose . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so glad i amuse you . '' \\n▁ his mouth touched mine before he murmured , ` ` always . '' \\n▁ i shivered in his arms . \\n▁ those arms grew tighter . \\n▁ even though this felt good , curiosity was killing me . \\n▁ ` ` well , are you going to explain ? '' \\n▁ he rolled to his back taking me with him so i was pressed mostly to his side but partially lying on top of him . \\n▁ he tucked my forehead in his neck and started to play with my hair before he began . \\n▁ ` ` during the revolution , i was a general . \\n▁ a very … '' he hesitated then went on , ` ` successful general . '' \\n▁ i shivered at his words but this time reading the meaning behind them it was in a different way . \\n▁ he stopped playing with my hair and wrapped his arm around me before continuing , ` ` after the revolution i was a hunter . '' \\n▁ his voice dipped low . \\n▁ ` ` and very successful at that as well . '' \\n▁ i 'd quit breathing again . \\n▁ i did not like this . \\n▁ at all . \\n▁ he hunted mortal and immortal mates ! \\n▁ oh . \\n▁ my . \\n▁ god . \\n▁ his arm gave me a squeeze and he whispered , ` ` not that kind of hunter , leah . \\n▁ never that . \\n▁ i 'd burn before doing that . '' \\n▁ i started breathing again . \\n▁ in fact my breath came out in an audible gush of relief . \\n▁ then i asked , ` ` what kind of hunter were you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i hunted the remainder of our enemy , my kind and those who allied with them . \\n▁ once warriors they 'd become renegades . \\n▁ they had to be found and stopped before they planned another revolution . \\n▁ i was the one who stopped them . '' \\n▁ i got up on an elbow and looked at his face in the weak light . \\n▁ i could tell something was not right . \\n▁ ` ` how many of you were there ? \\n▁ hunters , that is . '' \\n▁ ` ` just me . '' \\n▁ what ? \\n▁ this did n't make sense . \\n▁ ` ` really ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they only needed me . \\n▁ i was good at what i did . '' \\n▁ was he serious ? \\n▁ ` ` how many renegades were there ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` thousands . '' \\n▁ my mouth dropped open . \\n▁ he could n't be for real . \\n▁ if he was , this gave a whole new meaning to the words ` ` mighty vampire lucien '' ! \\n▁ ` ` were there … were there … '' i stammered , ` ` any other kind of hunters as good as you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you mean the hunters of mates ? '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ ` ` none ? '' \\n▁ ` ` there were at least twenty hunters , only hundreds of mates to be hunted . '' \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ ` ` why was it only you who hunted the renegades ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i was n't the only one at the beginning . \\n▁ the dominion recruited and dispatched other hunters . \\n▁ most of the others did n't survive . \\n▁ as i mentioned , i not only survived , i excelled . \\n▁ they pulled the others back and sent only me . '' \\n▁ this was crazy . \\n▁ lucien was super - vamp , singlehandedly crushing a possible rebellion ! \\n▁ this was remarkable , unbelievable and very , very cool . \\n▁ but that something that i sensed was wrong niggled at me , making me uncomfortable . \\n▁ i watched him for a moment , thinking of his magnificence , stephanie 's , cosmo 's , lucien 's obvious pride in his people and i said softly , ` ` you hunted your own . '' \\n▁ his hand came up , fingers curling around my neck and he explained as if i 'd made a gentle accusation which i had n't , ` ` they were also hunting , leah , and they were hunting mortals . \\n▁ feeding and killing . \\n▁ without thought or remorse . \\n▁ making a point , living their lives in the old ways . \\n▁ they were not only murdering innocents , they were putting everything we vampires fought for at risk . '' \\n▁ i stared at him . \\n▁ then i guessed , ` ` you did n't like doing it . '' \\n▁ he shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` regardless if i did n't believe in their way of life , enslaving your brethren and delivering them to their executions is not a fun job . '' \\n▁ he could say that again . \\n▁ i understood what that something wrong was and it made me incredibly sad . \\n▁ for lucien . \\n▁ something i never expected to be but there it was . \\n▁ i felt my body get soft and i pressed into him . \\n▁ lifting my hand to touch his face , i whispered , ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ when my palm rested against his cheek , i saw his eyes close slowly and the deep feeling so obvious in his handsome face made me catch my breath . \\n▁ he was immensely good - looking but looking at him in that moment , he 'd never been more striking . \\n▁ not ever . \\n▁ i felt my mouth part in awe and i desperately wanted to kiss him . \\n▁ and through my kiss i wanted to draw away his demons , absorb his emotion , take it away from him forever . \\n▁ before i got the chance to attempt this feat , his eyes opened and he murmured in a way that said he was trying to reassure me even though it was him i sensed reliving a nightmare , ` ` it was a long time ago , sweetling . '' \\n▁ ` ` it bothers you still . '' \\n▁ his hand went from my neck to my hand on his face . \\n▁ his long fingers curled around mine and he drew my knuckles to his lips , brushing them there . \\n▁ then his eyes locked on mine and he repeated , ` ` it bothers me still . '' \\n▁ i understood then why people acted the way they did around him and i shared , ` ` you 're a vampire hero . \\n▁ they admire you . '' \\n▁ ` ` they do , '' he agreed in a casual way that said it mattered very little to him and went on . \\n▁ ` ` they also fear me . '' \\n▁ i was thinking they probably should . \\n▁ he could hunt down thousands of vampires on his own , that was pretty freaking scary . \\n▁ ` ` what does this have to do with me ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ he rested his hand still holding mine on his chest . \\n▁ ` ` because of the status they ' ve placed on me , people take an interest in what i take an interest in . \\n▁ that , plus other annoying things , goes with the territory . \\n▁ however with you , i marked you twenty years ago and waited . \\n▁ this is n't my usual behavior . \\n▁ your behavior is n't the usual concubine behavior either . \\n▁ this intrigued my people and they started watching and waiting to see what would happen . \\n▁ now , i fear , they 're no less intrigued . '' \\n▁ ` ` so , in a way , we 're like the mortal and vampire elizabeth taylor and richard burton , without the weddings and such , of course , '' i muttered . \\n▁ i felt relief sweep through me when the air cleared , his face softened and his lips twitched . \\n▁ ` ` something like that . '' \\n▁ well , that was one question answered and , as usual , it made sense . \\n▁ now for the one that might freak me out , not that the last one did n't . \\n▁ ` ` why do you think you can make me safe from my dream ? '' \\n▁ he rolled us to our sides , pulling me up so i was face - to - face with him and gathering me close . \\n▁ ` ` you remember the conversation you overheard this morning ? '' \\n▁ he asked and i nodded . \\n▁ how could i forget ? \\n▁ he continued , ` ` i think you 're xxunk yourself to me . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , i remember you saying that . \\n▁ what does that have to do with - ? '' \\n▁ he interrupted me , saying , ` ` you 're dreaming of the sentence . '' \\n▁ i fell silent but my heart tripped . \\n▁ his eyes grew contemplative . \\n▁ ` ` has your mother or one of your aunts explained the sentence ? '' \\n▁ they had n't , as such . \\n▁ i shook my head deciding not to lie out loud . \\n▁ ` ` edwina ? \\n▁ stephanie ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ i shook my head again , this time not xxunk lying . \\n▁ when he spoke again , it sounded like he was speaking aloud to himself , not to me . \\n▁ ` ` then you must have somehow sensed it from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` sensed what from you ? \\n▁ what 's the sentence ? '' \\n▁ his eyes refocused and he murmured , ` ` it 's not pretty , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ ` ` i could guess that , '' i replied . \\n▁ his lips turned up before he began to explain , ` ` the dominion created the sentence for mortal and immortal mates who would not denounce each other . \\n▁ they did it in hopes that the others being tortured or yet to be caught would spare their partners from this by quickly denouncing them . \\n▁ what they understood , and i reminded them , as did cosmo , stephanie and other advisors at the time , was that a vampire 's vow is his or her bond . \\n▁ he , or she , will never denounce any vow , no matter what might befall them . '' \\n▁ he took in a breath then continued , ` ` in many cases , when vampires mate , their xxunk are a promise , not a vow . \\n▁ there is a nuance of difference but it 's there and for a vampire that nuance is crucial . \\n▁ the understanding being that eternal life with another may not work out after centuries . \\n▁ to promise forever opens the relationship to severance . \\n▁ to vow forever , never . \\n▁ however , in most cases when a vampire took a mortal as a mate , during the claiming they vowed to be with their mortal forever . \\n▁ this , a vampire would never denounce . \\n▁ the dominion was , however , with some experience of the behavior of mortals , counting on the mortal being less devoted . \\n▁ unfortunately , they were wrong and dozens of sentences were carried out . '' \\n▁ ` ` let me guess , '' i whispered , ` ` the mortal was hanged , the vampire burned . '' \\n▁ he gave me a squeeze and nodded , but said , ` ` worse . '' \\n▁ what was worse than that ? \\n▁ he answered my unasked question , ` ` it happened simultaneously . \\n▁ the fire was lit so the mortal could watch the burning commence . \\n▁ then the hanging proceeded so the vampire could watch his beloved swing before he died . '' \\n▁ i knew that too but i still gasped when lucien confirmed it . \\n▁ ` ` the dominion enjoyed one success from this , '' he informed me . \\n▁ ` ` it proved a healthy deterrent from any such future xxunk . '' \\n▁ i dropped my head , looked at his throat and muttered , ` ` not surprising . '' \\n▁ he kissed my forehead and i tilted my head back to face him . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't remember my dream but that 's what it felt like , '' i told him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no doubt that 's what it is , '' he replied . \\n▁ ` ` why am i dreaming about that when i did n't even know it existed ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no idea . '' \\n▁ ` ` can you explain what happened last night ? '' \\n▁ he shook his head but said , ` ` i have a theory . '' \\n▁ when he did n't continue , i prompted , ` ` and that would be ? '' \\n▁ he pulled me closer and whispered , ` ` you 're connected to me , my pet , in a way i ' ve never experienced before . '' \\n▁ he was n't wrong about that . \\n▁ and it made me a tad bit uncomfortable at the same time i found it made me a lot more than a tad bit safe . \\n▁ more contradictory emotions . \\n▁ great . \\n▁ when i made no reply , he continued , ` ` and you have a strength of will that 's astonishing . \\n▁ this most likely means your subconscious strength of will is indestructible . \\n▁ when you dreamed the dream when i was n't here to soothe you , hold you , me there , living and breathing and not burning , something that would prove your dream false , your subconscious carried forward the dream . '' \\n▁ ` ` that sounds crazy , '' i told him because it xxunk - blank did ! \\n▁ ` ` yes , you 're correct . \\n▁ it does , '' lucien agreed . \\n▁ ` ` even so you ca n't deny that the dream carried on , you felt it physically and it continued until you linked to me on the phone . '' \\n▁ this was even crazier . \\n▁ but it was also true . \\n▁ i stayed silent . \\n▁ lucien went on , ` ` and your mind shut down , you descended into xxunk until you connected with my physically and only then did you reanimate . '' \\n▁ after saying this , his face got closer , only a breath from mine and his voice went soft . \\n▁ ` ` sweetling , this tells me i ' m the catalyst to stop your dream . \\n▁ it tells me that i can keep you safe . '' \\n▁ his words and the way he said them , softly but with confidence and more than a hint of satisfaction , made me tremble . \\n▁ nevertheless , although his explanation was logical and plausible , as lucien tended to be , i still did n't buy it . \\n▁ something else was at work here . \\n▁ there might be no paranormal , supernatural , black or any other kind of magic happening in the world of vampires and other creatures but what i was experiencing with my dreams was something different . \\n▁ i did n't know if it was magic but it was something , something otherworldly , i just knew it . \\n▁ and it frightened me to bits . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ lucien called . \\n▁ ` ` mm ? '' \\n▁ i replied , deep in thought . \\n▁ ` ` listen to me , '' he ordered and when i focused on him , he continued , ` ` and i want you to listen closely , pet . '' \\n▁ he was being serious , deadly serious and i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't want you sleeping when i ' m not close . \\n▁ until these dreams subside , you sleep only when i ' m in the house preferably when you 're in bed with me . '' \\n▁ i nodded my head again not because i was submitting to his order but because i guessed he was right . \\n▁ he was the catalyst that stopped the dream and seeing as i did n't want to be hanged by an invisible rope while sensing lucien burned at the stake , i was willing to give in this time . \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ i felt his big body relax against mine and i had n't noticed he 'd grown so tense . \\n▁ i tucked my face in his throat and slid my arm around him , burrowing even closer . \\n▁ ` ` are we done talking ? '' \\n▁ he asked the top of my head . \\n▁ ` ` i have a million more questions , '' i answered his throat . \\n▁ ` ` will they wait until tomorrow ? '' \\n▁ considering it already was tomorrow and for other reasons besides the answer was , not really . \\n▁ now that i was on a roll , no matter that it freaked me out , i still wanted to know as much as i could so i could know what i was up against . \\n▁ however , much of what i wanted to know i needed to ask stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i told him . \\n▁ he kissed the top of my head and tangled his legs with mine . \\n▁ in his lucien way , something which i realized was now endearingly familiar , he was settling in for sleep . \\n▁ i settled with him . \\n▁ and i allowed myself to feel what i had n't allowed myself to feel the many times he 'd done this before . \\n▁ content . \\n▁ my throat clogged as my mind protested but my heart , for once , refused to be denied . \\n▁ aunt nadia was right . \\n▁ many people never had something beautiful not even for a short while . \\n▁ lucien was giving me something beautiful and even though it was temporary , it was a gift my heart knew it was imperative to accept . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ his voice was husky and sleepy when he called my name and my heart accepted that too . \\n▁ ` ` hmm ? '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , my pet . '' \\n▁ his voice was still husky but there was a depth of meaning to those four words that made my heart stutter . \\n▁ i was n't entirely certain what he was thanking me for but i could guess . \\n▁ he was thanking me for giving him me . \\n▁ another gift . \\n▁ i closed my eyes and burrowed deeper while my heart accepted that too . \\n▁ chapter eighteen the nightmare stephanie , cosmo , avery , rafe , fiona , edwina , his children , his mother and leah 's entire family attended the ancient claiming ceremony . \\n▁ a ceremony that was performed for all vampire unions . \\n▁ a ceremony that had n't been conducted between a mortal and immortal in over five hundred years . \\n▁ xxunk the traditional blood red , she wore a sophisticated ivory satin gown , a nod to her culture . \\n▁ he 'd given her diamonds for her ears and wrists and dozens nestled in her upswept hair . \\n▁ a black diamond already adorned her left ring finger , its matching bands , another nod to her culture , would be placed at its base . \\n▁ but her exquisite throat was bare . \\n▁ he took of her blood . \\n▁ she took of his . \\n▁ when she did this , her nose wrinkled before her lips locked to the wound he tore into his own flesh at his wrist . \\n▁ however , when she suckled , her eyes lifted to his and grew wide with wonder . \\n▁ lucien laughed . \\n▁ he swept his tongue against his wound and drew her close in the circle of his arms . \\n▁ his voice resonating through the small assemblage , he declared the words of claiming , words he 'd said twice before , to maggie then , five hundred years later , to katrina . \\n▁ regardless of what happened with both of his earlier unions , they were not bitter . \\n▁ they were only sweet . \\n▁ and this time , he did not speak them as promise . \\n▁ he spoke them as vow . \\n▁ ` ` until the sun falls from the sky . '' \\n▁ tears filled her eyes and she pressed deep into his body . \\n▁ unlike his commanding declaration , when she spoke she spoke only to him . \\n▁ in a soft voice , leah repeated , ` ` until the sun falls from the sky . '' \\n▁ cheers went up all around them along with happy sobs but lucien processed none of it . \\n▁ the only thing in his universe was the woman in his arms . \\n▁ * * * * * lucien was running , leah 's hand in his , he could hear her panting even though she had uncommon speed for a mortal , something else she 'd picked up from him . \\n▁ even so , she was nowhere near as swift as him and he could hear them getting closer . \\n▁ he wasted precious time , stopped and flung her over his shoulder . \\n▁ then he ran . \\n▁ their hunting meant that stephanie had failed . \\n▁ as had cosmo , avery , rafe , hamish , jordan , duncan , hermes , orlando and scores of others . \\n▁ his army . \\n▁ his and leah 's personal guard . \\n▁ he would never have guessed their defeat . \\n▁ their loss , which surely meant their deaths , caused a searing pain to slice through his gut but his legs did n't falter . \\n▁ ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ leah 's voice was harsh , his name broken with his strides . \\n▁ he did n't reply . \\n▁ his focus was distance , escape . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , let me down . '' \\n▁ ` ` quiet , '' he grunted , his own breath coming fast and short , not from the effort , but from his dread . \\n▁ ` ` let them get me . '' \\n▁ silence , he commanded . \\n▁ let them have me , darling . \\n▁ you go . \\n▁ of course , being leah , she would n't leave it be . \\n▁ we 're not discussing this . \\n▁ he sensed their pursuers losing ground but he did n't slow . \\n▁ let me go . \\n▁ you need to live to fight so other vampires can be free , she urged , her voice thick with emotion . \\n▁ so my people can stay free . \\n▁ not without you , never without you . \\n▁ they 're counting on you . \\n▁ i do n't give a f * * k . \\n▁ they want it ; they can fight for it on their own . \\n▁ silence . \\n▁ then , so xxunk ! \\n▁ she snapped to his brain . \\n▁ he kept running . \\n▁ * * * * * the drug coursing through his system making him weak , he watched leah walk up the scaffold . \\n▁ lydia cried out , the sound the definition of agony . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes never left his mate . \\n▁ denounce me , lucien ordered . \\n▁ never , leah shot back , a tremble betraying the strength behind her tone . \\n▁ he thrilled at her word even as it tore at his heart . \\n▁ this time , when he spoke , it was a plea , denounce me , my pet . \\n▁ i 'd rather die with you than live without you . \\n▁ he nearly smiled . \\n▁ drama , he muttered into her mind . \\n▁ this is n't funny . \\n▁ she was absolutely correct . \\n▁ using what strength he had , his next words were a command he knew she could n't defy . \\n▁ denounce me . \\n▁ her body jerked , her pale , worn face going all the more ashen . \\n▁ but her eyes were defiant . \\n▁ never . \\n▁ he was stunned and horrified and now unbelievably frightened . \\n▁ he 'd not had to control her mind for years and in those years she 'd obviously built up an immunity . \\n▁ they stopped her under the noose and put it around her neck . \\n▁ she stood , arms tied behind her back , wearing her ivory claiming gown . \\n▁ another defiance , not of him , of the dominion . \\n▁ even facing certain death , she was magnificent . \\n▁ that vile feeling he 'd felt so long ago when he thought he 'd broken her , a feeling he had n't had in years , ripped through him . \\n▁ without delay , they touched the torch to the kindling around his feet . \\n▁ another scream of agony , this piercing the air and coming from katrina . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes never left leah . \\n▁ i love you , she whispered to his mind . \\n▁ he closed his eyes . \\n▁ he sensed the heat but nothing could slice through the altogether different , far more powerful pain . \\n▁ i love you too , sweetling . \\n▁ he opened his eyes to see her smile , radiant and beautiful . \\n▁ then the trapdoor opened and she fell . \\n▁ * * * * * with a jerk lucien came awake . \\n▁ the sun was blazing around the curtains but the room was still dark . \\n▁ he felt a tightness in his gut , his skin dampened with sweat , leah curled into the curve of his body , her heartbeat and breathing steady . \\n▁ asleep . \\n▁ ` ` holy christ , '' he whispered . \\n▁ he remembered every vivid , horrifying second of his dream . \\n▁ every excruciating second . \\n▁ he could actually feel the smooth satin of her claiming gown under his hands , the weight of her body over his shoulder as he ran , the touch of the flame . \\n▁ ` ` holy christ , '' he repeated . \\n▁ was this what she was dreaming ? \\n▁ was this what sent her fleeing the bed , terrified and sobbing ? \\n▁ it had to be . \\n▁ ` ` holy christ , '' he gritted between his teeth . \\n▁ she stirred . \\n▁ he moved , turning her still sleeping body into his arms , he put his mouth to her , tasting her , his hands stroking at the same time . \\n▁ down his mouth went to her breast , he rolled his tongue around a nipple . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ her sleepy voice sounded , her hands came to his shoulders . \\n▁ he moved south . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she breathed , the fingers of one hand sliding into his hair . \\n▁ he spread her legs , shifted her calves over his shoulders and put his mouth to her . \\n▁ relentlessly , he feasted on her as she gasped and panted , her fingers clenched in his hair , her h * ps bucking . \\n▁ voracious , always voracious , his leah , this time , demanding more of his mouth . \\n▁ her muscles tensed , heels digging into his back and she cried out his name when she came . \\n▁ he surged over her , controlling his heart , calling out to hers , making them beat as one while slamming into her lush wetness savagely in one , long , smooth , brutal thrust as she panted out his name again still in the throes of her cl * * ax . \\n▁ he nearly forgot to sweep his tongue along her neck before he extended his razor - sharp fangs and tore through her flesh . \\n▁ then he was thrusting , her body jerking , her blood pumping into his mouth with each deep , violent plunge , every beat of their hearts throbbing in tandem . \\n▁ he 'd been correct . \\n▁ fucking rapture . \\n▁ she wrapped herself tightly around him and came again , harder , nails digging into his skin , breath catching and halting , heart tripping . \\n▁ he felt the pressure building in his own body , sharp and fierce , his c * * k aching to release . \\n▁ he closed her wound with his tongue and used her hair to force her to face him . \\n▁ her eyes half - closed , somnolent , sated , he shook her head with his fist in her hair , trying to be gentle and fearing he 'd failed when her eyes snapped open . \\n▁ ` ` you 're mine , '' he growled , surging into her . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' she panted without delay . \\n▁ ` ` say it , '' he demanded . \\n▁ she acquiesced , again immediately , ` ` i ' m yours . '' \\n▁ ` ` always . '' \\n▁ as he thrust into her , faster , harder , the pressure building , her body jolting under him , he felt her limbs tense and watched as her face paled . \\n▁ she did n't speak . \\n▁ ` ` say it , leah . \\n▁ always , '' he ground out . \\n▁ ` ` lucien … '' he thrust into her , deeper , harder and she whimpered in pleasure . \\n▁ ` ` say it ! '' \\n▁ he commanded . \\n▁ her eyes locked with his . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m yours , lucien , '' she whispered , ` ` always . '' \\n▁ it was at that moment he came , long and hard , an orgasm unparalleled in eight hundred years . \\n▁ it was even better than the one she 'd given him last night during their first joining which he would have thought impossible . \\n▁ after , he allowed his weight to collapse on her for long moments before he heard her breath turn heavy from taking his burden . \\n▁ then he rolled them , careful to keep them joined , so he was on his back , she was straddling him , her torso to his , her face in his neck , breath still coming fast and brushing lightly against his skin . \\n▁ moments passed , lucien matching his heart to the pulsing rhythm of leah 's as he tried to shut down his mind . \\n▁ to shut out the images burned there from his dream . \\n▁ the traces of satin on his hands . \\n▁ the dread tearing through his soul as he sought to escape the hunt . \\n▁ none of this reconciled with leah in his arms , her sweet wetness still tight around his cock , her br * * sts crushed against his chest , her heartbeat thumping rapidly . \\n▁ belatedly , he smelled her fear . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ her heart skipped and his skipped with it . \\n▁ then she whispered , ` ` what was that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' she started to lift up but his arms held her captive . \\n▁ ` ` do n't move , '' he ordered , ` ` we 'll disconnect . '' \\n▁ she stilled . \\n▁ then she asked , ` ` lucien , what just happened ? '' \\n▁ he had no earthly idea . \\n▁ he 'd never behaved with such a driven even desperate need before . \\n▁ this was n't true . \\n▁ when he discovered the enemy had tortured and murdered his mate , he 'd behaved with a driven , desperate need for fifty years . \\n▁ first fighting then hunting anyone who had anything to do with those who brought about maggie 's death . \\n▁ why he felt that need now , outside a reaction to the nightmare , he did n't know . \\n▁ what he did know was that he was n't going to tell leah that he 'd shared her dream . \\n▁ this would likely alarm her and until he understood what was happening he intended to shelter her from that . \\n▁ so in an effort to shield her , lucien lied . \\n▁ he moved his h * ps and her muscles contracted deliciously around his still - hard cock . \\n▁ ` ` i think the answer to that is fairly obvious , pet . '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ you … we , '' she stammered , ` ` it 's never been like that . '' \\n▁ his fingers sifted in her hair and he murmured , ` ` we ' ve only been lovers one night , leah . '' \\n▁ her body jerked and he caught her again before her movements could break their joining , something which he was compelled to prolong , again for reasons unknown . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't mean it 's never been like that between you and me . \\n▁ i mean it 's never been like that for me ever . \\n▁ maybe for any woman in the history of time . '' \\n▁ drama , he thought in a moment of amusement before his gut clenched in memory . \\n▁ i ' m not being dramatic ! \\n▁ she retorted and his body jolted in shock . \\n▁ he had n't been speaking to her . \\n▁ or , more accurately , he had n't meant for her to hear . \\n▁ ` ` did you hear me ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , you were talking to me . \\n▁ or , i should say , making fun of me . '' \\n▁ she tried to move again but he kept her pinned to him . \\n▁ ` ` let me up , '' she demanded . \\n▁ his arms grew tight before he responded , ` ` i want to feel you around me for a little while longer . '' \\n▁ she pressed against him . \\n▁ ` ` let … me … up ! '' \\n▁ he let her up but only her torso . \\n▁ he kept her h * ps fixed to his with an arm about her waist . \\n▁ she glared down at him , her hair falling about her face in waves . \\n▁ looking at her , finally he felt the clutch of the nightmare release . \\n▁ this was leah , his leah , now fully his , all of her . \\n▁ not running , not hiding , not climbing a scaffold , she was alive and , apparently , angry . \\n▁ this made him smile which made her glare turn to a scowl which , in turn , made his smile deepen . \\n▁ ` ` you seem in an immensely foul mood for someone who just came twice , '' he remarked . \\n▁ her eyes widened , her anger accelerated , he knew because her heart did as well taking his with it . \\n▁ she opened her mouth to speak and then suddenly shook her head and looked to the side . \\n▁ then she muttered , ` ` why could n't i be some other immortal 's concubine ? \\n▁ a werewolf . \\n▁ or frankenstein , i could escape frankenstein . \\n▁ he does n't move very fast . \\n▁ a wraith would be good , they 're ethereal . \\n▁ i could probably slip … '' she had n't noticed his body freeze but she stopped talking when he whipped her to her back . \\n▁ disconnecting their joining , he settled on top of her , pinning her to the bed . \\n▁ she stared up at him in surprise . \\n▁ ` ` what do you know of other immortals ? '' \\n▁ he demanded , savage fury tingeing his voice primarily because he was savagely furious . \\n▁ she reacted to the fury . \\n▁ he smelled it and he heard it and he did n't give a f * * k. ` ` wh … what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` what do you know of other immortals ? \\n▁ werewolves ? \\n▁ wraiths ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' she whispered . \\n▁ lucien shook her and he did n't do it gently . \\n▁ ` ` tell me , damn it ! '' \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know ! '' \\n▁ she gasped . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , avery … '' she stopped speaking , her eyes dropping to his jaw as it went rigid . \\n▁ between clenched teeth , he gritted , ` ` i ' m going to f * * king kill him . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ her tone was uncertain and very frightened . \\n▁ he gaze bore into hers . \\n▁ ` ` do n't tell anyone you know of the existence of other immortals , leah . \\n▁ not a single soul . \\n▁ not your family , not stephanie , not edwina - '' ` ` edwina knows , '' she admitted softly . \\n▁ ` ` she was there when avery - '' he closed his eyes and ground out , ` ` fucking hell . '' \\n▁ ` ` he did n't say anything , lucien . \\n▁ not anything , '' leah defended hurriedly and he opened his eyes to glare at her . \\n▁ ` ` he just said he was immortal but he was n't a vampire . \\n▁ he did n't tell me what he was . \\n▁ he did n't tell me what other immortals there were . \\n▁ he said if he said anything it would mean his death . \\n▁ earlier i was just guessing . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll wager , my pet , he did n't tell you that if anyone found out you knew then you 'd face certain death . '' \\n▁ she pulled in a sharp breath . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' lucien clipped . \\n▁ ` ` so no one is in on this secret . \\n▁ no one . \\n▁ i 'll have a word with edwina and i 'll have several with avery . '' \\n▁ her hand came to his neck , fingers curling there and he could feel the slight tremor . \\n▁ ` ` please do n't be angry with him . \\n▁ he was trying to be kind , '' leah whispered . \\n▁ ` ` putting your life in danger is far from kind , '' lucien returned , his anger not abating , the nightmare too fresh as was this new danger . \\n▁ pain slashed through her face before she went on , her voice gentle , ` ` maybe he 's tired of hiding , lucien . \\n▁ maybe he felt he was among friends . \\n▁ maybe he knew i 'd accept him . \\n▁ maybe he trusted me . \\n▁ that is n't something to be angry about . \\n▁ that 's an honor he bestowed on me . '' \\n▁ ` ` letting me break you one day does n't make you friend and protector of all immortals the next , leah . '' \\n▁ his tone was sharp and derisive because her words had no effect . \\n▁ he was still angry . \\n▁ and troubled . \\n▁ the council was considering his request . \\n▁ they owed him and he had friends on the council , friends who he had no doubt would become allies if things did n't go his way . \\n▁ therefore friends who would do all in their considerable power to make things go his way . \\n▁ no one wanted war . \\n▁ those who were not friends , those who wished to defy change because they feared it or because they hated him were using rafe 's behavior as grounds to deny lucien 's request . \\n▁ rafe had not yet taken lana as a lover but he 'd told lucien he wanted to and he was now spending the night with her , this being the reason why the council finally called him in . \\n▁ rafe had not joined with her because he feared for her safety . \\n▁ lucien approved of rafe 's intentions and when speaking to him encouraged them . \\n▁ as he would encourage any vampire who wished to bloody well behave like a f * * king vampire . \\n▁ if this was known , this would not sway the council in his favor , even his friends might demur . \\n▁ allowing lucien a boon was one thing , allowing rampant and widespread change to centuries of tradition was another . \\n▁ however , if it was known that leah held the knowledge that other cultures existed , he 'd not get his request granted for she 'd be executed . \\n▁ no , she 'd be hunted then she 'd be executed . \\n▁ they had enough to worry about , most of it she did n't even know , they did n't f * * king need this . \\n▁ he caught her flinch at his mocking words . \\n▁ it wounded him but he ignored it . \\n▁ he 'd make it up to her and she 'd forgive him . \\n▁ at that moment he had to make her understand . \\n▁ ` ` that was n't nice , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` no , it was n't . \\n▁ i was n't trying to be nice , pet . \\n▁ i was trying to get it through that thick , stubborn head of yours that this is serious . '' \\n▁ her eyes flashed . \\n▁ ` ` i may be stubborn , lucien … '' she hesitated , looking strangely but also hilariously confused for a second then repeated , ` ` lucien whatever - your - last - name - is , but i ' m not stupid . \\n▁ i think i get it . \\n▁ certain death is a pretty big motivator to keep a secret . '' \\n▁ when she stopped speaking , she glared at him . \\n▁ he returned her glare . \\n▁ he felt her discomfort well before he was ready to back down . \\n▁ finally and xxunk she demanded to know , ` ` what is your last name anyway ? '' \\n▁ lucien relaxed , partially because he believed she understood his concern , mostly because she was amusing . \\n▁ ` ` vampires do n't have last names . '' \\n▁ her anger dissipated , her eyes grew wide and she replied , ` ` so , you 're like cher ? \\n▁ madonna ? \\n▁ you 're just lucien ? '' \\n▁ ` ` cher and madonna were born with surnames , they simply do n't use them . \\n▁ but i am ` just lucien ' . '' \\n▁ her eyes slid to his shoulder and she mumbled , ` ` how weird . '' \\n▁ gently , lucien reminded her , ` ` it 's far from weird . '' \\n▁ her gaze shot back to his , it went soft and her body became pliant underneath him . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't mean that in a bad way , '' she whispered , each word clearly heartfelt . \\n▁ christ , she was sweet . \\n▁ twenty years of watching her and hearing of her , he 'd had a good idea of what he 'd get when he finally had her . \\n▁ at that moment , he realized he 'd had no idea . \\n▁ and this added blessing settled warmly in his gut . \\n▁ his weight eased into her soft body and she automatically accommodated it . \\n▁ he touched his lips to hers and rested their foreheads together . \\n▁ ` ` i know you did n't , sweetling . '' \\n▁ her hand slid up to rest on his chest before she asked softly , ` ` are you going to stop being scary lucien now ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m never scary lucien , '' he replied and she gave him a look so disbelieving it was comical . \\n▁ therefore he shoved his face in her neck and burst out laughing . \\n▁ he rolled them yet again , positioning her against his side partially on top and she raised her head to look at him as his laughter died down to a chuckle . \\n▁ he lifted his hand to touch her eyebrow with a finger and he smoothed it across the arched line . \\n▁ with his movement , as he 'd intended , her face gentled and his finger drifted down her cheek where he touched her lips with his middle three fingertips . \\n▁ ` ` you never have to be scared of me , sweetheart , '' he told her quietly but firmly as his hand dropped away . \\n▁ she surprised him by asking , ` ` what about when your anger fills the room like a physical thing ? '' \\n▁ he wound his arms around her and gathered her closer . \\n▁ ` ` if that happens , leah , then it happens . \\n▁ there are times when i 'll get angry but no matter how angry i get , you never have anything to fear . '' \\n▁ regardless of his words and the feeling behind them she persevered . \\n▁ ` ` what about when your body goes all funny ? '' \\n▁ he blinked slowly before repeating , ` ` my body goes all funny ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yeah , it gets stiff , the muscles all tense , stand out . \\n▁ i ca n't explain it , but - '' lucien was appalled . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve done that to you ? '' \\n▁ she studied him , her look wary then she nodded before saying , ` ` just now and when , um … that time katrina came over . '' \\n▁ ` ` christ , '' he muttered , stunned and disgusted with himself . \\n▁ he had n't even felt it . \\n▁ ` ` i 'd said some awful things … '' she defended him and his arms gave her a gentle shake to stop her xxunk . \\n▁ ` ` that wo n't happen again , '' he declared . \\n▁ leah watched him , her eyes wide , lips parted and this time he did n't revel in a look that made her adorable . \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ she whispered . \\n▁ his reply was swift and terse . \\n▁ ` ` preparing for battle . '' \\n▁ ` ` wow , '' she breathed . \\n▁ ` ` against an immortal , leah , '' he went on , tone still curt . \\n▁ ` ` my strength is twenty times yours . \\n▁ when i ' m in a fight or flight situation , my adrenalin releases just as yours does , but it makes me twice as strong as i was before , twice as fast . \\n▁ if i were to - '' ` ` you did n't , '' she cut him off . \\n▁ ` ` and i would n't , '' he stated . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll repeat , my pet , when you 're with me , you never have anything to fear . '' \\n▁ at that , she replied , ` ` that part i know . '' \\n▁ after she spoke , he watched as her face stilled then horror filled it and she grew pale . \\n▁ her heart started racing . \\n▁ in his anger , he 'd ceased xxunk his to hers and his remained steady . \\n▁ but she 'd given something away and it was n't that she trusted he 'd never harm her . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ she looked toward the door and she quickly changed the subject , ` ` maybe we should call my family to come and have breakfast . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' ` ` i 'll make breakfast today . \\n▁ crepes suzette . '' \\n▁ the idea of leah attempting crepes suzette , which she 'd fail to do -lrb- not to mention it was dessert -rrb- , was infinitely amusing , especially considering xxunk was key to the dish 's success . \\n▁ he mentally located the fire extinguisher , just in case . \\n▁ at the thought of witnessing this endeavor and her reaction at her inevitable failure , lucien was tempted to let her off the hook . \\n▁ however , he did n't . \\n▁ ` ` look at me , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ her gaze flitted to his eyebrow . \\n▁ his arms tightened and his tone was a warning . \\n▁ ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ she sighed and her eyes caught his . \\n▁ ` ` what did you mean ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked . \\n▁ ` ` what did i mean what ? '' \\n▁ leah asked back . \\n▁ his eyes narrowed . \\n▁ she wrinkled her nose . \\n▁ ` ` tell me , leah , '' he ordered . \\n▁ ` ` oh all right , '' she snapped and frowned at him before admitting something astonishing and tremendously gratifying but doing so with extreme ill - humor . \\n▁ ` ` you make me feel safe . '' \\n▁ again , lucien was stunned . \\n▁ this time in a much better way . \\n▁ ` ` i make you feel safe , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` yes . \\n▁ you , '' she poked him in the chest , ` ` make me , '' she pointed to herself then her hand fluttered in the air , ` ` feel safe . '' \\n▁ she dropped her hand and stared at him . \\n▁ ` ` you 're big and fast and you can throw a xxunk blank car , for heaven 's sake . \\n▁ you make me feel tiny and sheltered and … well , safe ! '' \\n▁ that warmth in his gut started spreading . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' he began , his hand inching up her back , sifting into her hair . \\n▁ but she was n't quite through . \\n▁ glowering at him , she admitted irritably , ` ` my father left me , which was enough to twist me in a way that i 'd never feel safe . \\n▁ we were girls on our own . \\n▁ mom 's strong but , you know , sometimes … '' she trailed off , losing track of her theme then she found it and kept going , ` ` then every guy i ' ve ever been with has hit the top bell on the jerk - o - meter . \\n▁ you can be a jerk but , get this ! '' \\n▁ she fairly shouted . \\n▁ ` ` one of my boyfriends sat in the car while i changed the tire . \\n▁ another one did n't do a freaking thing when some guy was pawing me at a bar . \\n▁ after i got away i asked him why he sat there and watched and did not … one … thing and he said he did n't want to get ` into it ' with some ` moron ' and it was obvious i could ` sort myself out ' . '' \\n▁ she lifted her hands and used two fingers to put quotation emphasis on her words before dropping them again and finishing , ` ` can you believe ? '' \\n▁ he could n't . \\n▁ in fact the very idea infuriated him . \\n▁ he did n't get a chance to share this , she kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` you would n't make me change the tire and you would n't let some guy paw me and you have n't told me i have a fat ass and perhaps i should lay off the fried chicken . \\n▁ you 're big and heavy and strong and cart me around like i weigh as much as a kitten and you 're tall and i have to look up at you even when i ' m wearing heels , '' she uttered this last like it was a total impossibility for her to look up at anyone and to look up at him was akin to a miracle . \\n▁ however , she was n't quite finished . \\n▁ ` ` and you could probably change a tire just by glaring at it . '' \\n▁ lucien bit back laughter as he rolled her to her back and decided they were n't having crepes suzette . \\n▁ and definitely her family was n't coming over . \\n▁ his mouth went to her throat and he muttered , ` ` i ' m sorry to say i ca n't change a tire by glaring at it . '' \\n▁ her voice was no longer loud but breathy when she replied , ` ` you know what i mean . '' \\n▁ his mouth moved up and over her jaw to meet hers . \\n▁ looking into her eyes , he murmured his understatement , ` ` i ' m glad you feel safe with me , sweetling . '' \\n▁ she tried to make light of it by announcing , ` ` anyone would feel safe with you . \\n▁ i 'll repeat , you can throw a car . '' \\n▁ ` ` maybe , '' he allowed , ` ` but i ' m thrilled that you do . '' \\n▁ before she could speak again , he rewarded her admission with a kiss . \\n▁ without hesitating , her arms stole around him and she kissed him back , her mouth sweet , her tongue sweeter . \\n▁ his hand moved to her breast and cupped it , his thumb stroking its peak , feeling it harden instantly . \\n▁ his c * * k responded in kind . \\n▁ she gasped into his mouth . \\n▁ he lifted his head to watch her face as his thumb stroked back and as he did he liked what he saw . \\n▁ her cheeks warmed and she bit her lip . \\n▁ then she said , ` ` i ' m hungry . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll feed you , '' he assured her , executing another nipple swipe before he finished , ` ` later . '' \\n▁ her eyelids fluttered lower , desire evident in her face , he felt a further tightening in his groin but even so , she whispered , ` ` my family - '' he added a finger to his thumb and rolled . \\n▁ he was rewarded at once . \\n▁ her breath caught , her heart started hammering and he smelled the rush of heat between her restless legs . \\n▁ magnificent . \\n▁ ` ` later , '' he repeated , his head descending and his mouth was on hers when he heard it . \\n▁ her body froze beneath his as his head jerked up . \\n▁ his two fingers stopped rolling but all of them curled possessively around the swell of her breast . \\n▁ he listened and he could n't believe what he heard . \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ leah asked , a tremor of fear in her voice . \\n▁ his eyes caught hers . \\n▁ the doorbell rang . \\n▁ her body went solid and her fear permeated the air . \\n▁ lucien 's temper spiked . \\n▁ ` ` what is it ? '' \\n▁ she asked again , the fear stronger . \\n▁ ` ` it 's my f * * king family , '' he growled . \\n▁ he watched as her eyes grew wide , her lips parted and yet again he found no pleasure in her endearing expression . \\n▁ this was mainly because , instead of being able to do something about it , something they 'd both like very much , he had to go answer the f * * king door . \\n▁ chapter nineteen the family lucien walked the small pier to the end where he stopped and examined the lake . \\n▁ his children followed . \\n▁ he did n't speak for long moments and julian and isobel astutely left him to his silent contemplation of the serene water . \\n▁ then , quietly and menacingly , lucien spoke to the water . \\n▁ ` ` explain . '' \\n▁ ` ` he came to see me , father , '' isobel replied swiftly . \\n▁ ` ` and ? '' \\n▁ lucien prompted . \\n▁ ` ` i thought - '' isobel started but stopped when lucien 's head turned and his eyes sliced to his daughter . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he said softly , ` ` you did n't . '' \\n▁ her eyes slid to her brother . \\n▁ julian 's gaze locked with hers a moment before he looked to his boots . \\n▁ julian had his father 's build , his father 's hair but he had his mother 's startling blue eyes . \\n▁ they were clear sky blue . \\n▁ in all his years , lucien had never seen eyes that color except in the face of his ex - partner and his son . \\n▁ isobel had her mother 's curves and delicate bone structure but she had her father 's dark hair and eyes . \\n▁ she was petite for a vampire , an inch shorter than leah , her mother 's height . \\n▁ lucien was close with his children . \\n▁ he visited them when time allowed . \\n▁ they visited him the same . \\n▁ and he spoke to them regularly . \\n▁ at that moment , however , he 'd gladly throttle the both of them . \\n▁ starting with isobel . \\n▁ this was because she brought lucien 's father , etienne . \\n▁ it was safe to say lucien was not close to his father . \\n▁ this was because etienne was not a vampire you could get close to . \\n▁ he was cold , unfeeling and superior . \\n▁ this was also because etienne was not a vampire you 'd want to get close to because he was cold , unfeeling and superior but also because he was xxunk , sly , duplicitous and cruel . \\n▁ and lastly this was because of maggie . \\n▁ etienne had little to do with mortals except partaking of them as food and , at the feasts he liked to attend , partaking of them in other ways . \\n▁ some of them , in the cold , unfeeling , superior and savage ways he did it , not entirely welcomed by the mortals who attended the feasts and usually those mortals were up for everything . \\n▁ he 'd been called on this by the dominion on more than one occasion and therefore had learned to hide these proclivities but lucien , as did many , knew he had not ceased this behavior . \\n▁ etienne held no regard for mortals , never had . \\n▁ therefore he had hated lucien 's union with maggie . \\n▁ and lastly he had not kept this feeling a secret from lucien or from maggie . \\n▁ this was not something lucien had forgiven nor would he ever forgive . \\n▁ further , lucien was not brimming with excitement to have his ex - partner , julian 's mother , cressida , in the home he shared with leah . \\n▁ this was not because he did n't enjoy an amicable relationship with cressida . \\n▁ he enjoyed a lot of things about and with cressida , things he no longer intended to enjoy . \\n▁ this was because cressida was like a cat and cats liked to play with their prey and she would see leah as prey , no doubt about it . \\n▁ although leah would need to show respect to cressida as vampire , cressida would not offer that same respect to leah as concubine regardless if this was leah 's due and lucien 's demand . \\n▁ it would amuse cressida to play with leah and to defy lucien 's demands . \\n▁ she had , since he 'd known her , liked her challenges . \\n▁ she did it often with him and others . \\n▁ with lucien , even after they 'd ended their relationship , these challenges always ended physical , first as vampire combat then as something altogether more pleasant . \\n▁ this had carried on for centuries until lucien had tied himself to katrina . \\n▁ and this would be what she would take delight in throwing in leah 's face . \\n▁ luckily , they 'd also brought lucien 's mother , magdalene . \\n▁ now lucien was close with his mother . \\n▁ it was a mystery lucien had never solved how magdalene and etienne had coupled . \\n▁ magdalene was the opposite of lucien 's father . \\n▁ after years of contemplating this enigma , the only answers lucien could come up with were that they were both very young vampires when they started their union and it lasted less than twenty years which was clearly all magdalene could take . \\n▁ unlike lucien and cressida , their relationship was not amicable . \\n▁ therefore , upon sensing who his company was , he 'd ordered leah to shower and get ready and fortunately she 'd obeyed . \\n▁ he 'd gone down to greet his family and then he 'd called leah 's family and taken her himself to their guest house where he 'd left her . \\n▁ leah had not even glimpsed his family on her way out of the house nor , unusually quiet and docile , had she questioned his actions . \\n▁ on his way home , he 'd called avery to ask him to go to the guest house to guard her . \\n▁ then he 'd come home and left his father , mother and ex in the house in order to speak to his children privately . \\n▁ which brought him to now . \\n▁ lucien looked to his son . \\n▁ ` ` and you ? '' \\n▁ julian 's head came up as did his brows . \\n▁ ` ` me ? '' \\n▁ ` ` cressida , '' lucien answered , striving for patience for julian was being purposefully obtuse , something he did more than occasionally . \\n▁ ` ` cressida was curious , '' julian answered and lucien decided this was likely the truth . \\n▁ he also knew his son shared a close bond with his mother . \\n▁ it was a rare occurrence when julian did n't give into her every whim . \\n▁ it was a rare occurrence when anyone did n't give into her every whim . \\n▁ the only person who did n't was lucien . \\n▁ lucien 's voice was low with meaning when he reminded them , ` ` i think i spoke to you both about this . '' \\n▁ ` ` you did , father , but - '' isobel started . \\n▁ ` ` but nothing , '' lucien cut her off , ` ` not only was your judgment poor your decisions were dangerous . '' \\n▁ julian spoke quickly . \\n▁ ` ` cressida would never - '' lucien interrupted , ` ` etienne would . '' \\n▁ julian sighed and nodded his agreement for , indeed , etienne would . \\n▁ ` ` people are talking , '' isobel put in , ` ` quite a bit . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m aware of that , '' lucien informed her . \\n▁ ` ` you had to know the talk would reach etienne 's ears , '' she went on . \\n▁ ` ` yes , i knew that as well , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` therefore , '' she continued , ` ` when he approached me , i thought about it and decided that it would be better for him to think he was in the family fold rather than for him to maneuver outside of it . '' \\n▁ ` ` keep your enemies close , '' julian muttered , his eyes on his father . \\n▁ this was , lucien had to admit , sound logic . \\n▁ regardless , it did n't explain why they 'd perpetrated a surprise visit . \\n▁ ` ` and he 'll maneuver , we all know that , '' isobel continued . \\n▁ ` ` he does n't agree with what you 're doing even though he 's told me he does and he only wants to offer you his support and allegiance . '' \\n▁ ` ` he might even be a mole , '' julian added . \\n▁ ` ` absolutely , '' lucien agreed , turning to face his children , ` ` which is why i understand your logic but your judgment is still in question as to why you 'd bring him here . '' \\n▁ ` ` we thought - '' julian began but lucien again interrupted . \\n▁ ` ` we ' ve established that you did n't . '' \\n▁ on his last word , he leaned slightly toward his son and saw a muscle in julian 's cheek twitch . \\n▁ ` ` that vampire should be nowhere near leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` father , '' isobel whispered , ` ` it was my idea . \\n▁ etienne wanted to take you off guard . \\n▁ he said it was because he knew you would not wish his visit so he did n't want to xxunk you of it but i know it was so he could take you and your concubine by surprise . \\n▁ i decided if i did n't agree to come with him , he 'd do it himself . \\n▁ so i talked xxunk and magdalene into coming with us and cressida is , well … cressida so she 's here too . \\n▁ now your mortal is protected . \\n▁ even cressida would n't allow etienne to harm your concubine if he should do the impossible and get past you . '' \\n▁ ` ` there are a number of ways to harm leah , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` many of which you ca n't know . \\n▁ however , if you 'd phoned and warned me of this visit , i could have explained them to you . '' \\n▁ julian was openly curious . \\n▁ isobel 's face went blank which meant she was equally curious . \\n▁ julian had the brute strength of his father and thus did n't play his cards close to his vest . \\n▁ he could best practically anyone -lrb- save lucien -rrb- and , if challenged , did n't hesitate to do so . \\n▁ lucien 's son was hot - headed and acted on his emotions therefore he was lucky he was a strong , capable , intuitive fighter . \\n▁ isobel , being petite , had to rely more on her cunning for most vampires were stronger than her and almost all were bigger . \\n▁ her focus , craftiness and endurance were the most dangerous weapons in her arsenal and she used them well . \\n▁ also like her father . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve already tamed her , '' julian guessed . \\n▁ ` ` indeed , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' isobel breathed . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve taken her as lover ? \\n▁ before the council agreed ? '' \\n▁ lucien 's response was to lift his chin in the affirmative . \\n▁ ` ` brilliant , '' julian muttered failing at fighting his grin . \\n▁ isobel 's body jerked to face her brother . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk ! \\n▁ are you nuts ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he was still grinning but now it was directed at his sister . \\n▁ ` ` there are a couple tasty mortal morsels i would n't mind having . \\n▁ it 'll be nice to have that door opened . '' \\n▁ isobel 's body jerked back to face her father . \\n▁ ` ` father ! '' \\n▁ she snapped . \\n▁ ` ` listen to him ! \\n▁ this could mean - '' ` ` i know what it means , '' lucien cut her off , ` ` and i do n't give a f * * k. '' ` ` ca n't wait to meet this leah , '' julian murmured , still grinning . \\n▁ isobel ignored her brother and spoke to her father . \\n▁ ` ` i understand what you 're doing , why and you know you have my loyalty , no matter what , '' she paused then repeated in a voice that vibrated , ` ` no matter what , father . \\n▁ but this is too fast . \\n▁ vampires everywhere are having the same thoughts as you and xxunk and we 're not prepared . '' \\n▁ ` ` it took me ten minutes to talk the council into considering my request , bel , '' lucien replied quietly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sensing they understand that they may need to reconsider things not just for me and leah but for all vampires . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , perhaps , '' isobel allowed . \\n▁ ` ` but this is going beyond you and your mortal and rafe and her sister and even julian wanting to get himself some . \\n▁ orlando was seen at a feast with his concubine and they were embracing . \\n▁ and hermes selected his new concubine only a week ago and , just like you , he moved in with her the night of her bloodletting . '' \\n▁ lucien knew this as avery had told him just that morning . \\n▁ he could n't say it was unwelcome news . \\n▁ orlando was vicious in battle and hermes equally xxunk . \\n▁ both , like lucien , cosmo and stephanie , were roundly feared . \\n▁ it was surprising news that they 'd acted so swiftly but it was n't xxunk . \\n▁ if it came to it , his army was clearly amassing and their ranks were such others would avoid challenging . \\n▁ isobel kept speaking . \\n▁ ` ` so now it seems the council 's hand is being forced . \\n▁ they do n't like that . \\n▁ they so much do n't like that , even if they were to find in your and your concubine 's favor , they 'd find against it just to retain a vestige of control . '' \\n▁ lucien 's jaw got hard before he said , ` ` leah . '' \\n▁ isobel 's head twitched to the side before she asked , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you call her my concubine , my mortal but her name , bel , is leah , '' lucien returned and julian looked to his boots again but lucien kept his eyes locked on his daughter . \\n▁ her face went hard before she replied , ` ` i ' m not like etienne . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , i know . \\n▁ i know your words are said out of concern for me . \\n▁ but that does n't change the fact that she is not my concubine , my mortal , she 's leah , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ he watched his daughter 's face pale . \\n▁ ` ` but she is , father . \\n▁ regardless of the taming , of what you 're doing , she 's still your concubine . '' \\n▁ she hesitated before asking , ` ` is n't she ? '' \\n▁ ` ` she is . \\n▁ she 's also leah , '' lucien stated . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't get it , '' julian put in . \\n▁ lucien crossed his arms on his chest and he looked between his son and daughter before saying , ` ` then i 'll give it to you . \\n▁ as you know , i ' ve been waiting to have her for twenty years and i can tell you now that wait could have been a hundred years and i would not have been disappointed . '' \\n▁ isobel pulled in a sharp breath . \\n▁ julian 's gaze grew intense . \\n▁ lucien continued , ` ` there is more to her , much more than i expected . \\n▁ just leah being leah and more . '' \\n▁ he studied his children and then shared , ` ` she can mark me , with practice she may even be able to track me , tune me to her . \\n▁ i sense when she 's trying and it takes some effort to stop her from doing it . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' isobel breathed . \\n▁ ` ` you 're kidding , '' julian whispered . \\n▁ lucien did n't answer his son , he went on , ` ` she senses danger either on her own or through me . \\n▁ she can speak to me with her mind not only when i ' m reading hers but when she wishes to do so . '' \\n▁ neither of his children responded , they both simply stared at him in shock . \\n▁ lucien continued , ` ` and she and i are sharing dreams of the sentence . '' \\n▁ ` ` christ , '' julian muttered on a wince but isobel 's face went even paler . \\n▁ lucien carried on , ` ` leah 's dreams are vastly more powerful to the point where , if i ' m not with her , even awake the dream does n't leave her . \\n▁ indeed , the other night she nearly died by hanging such is the power of her mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh father , '' isobel whispered . \\n▁ ` ` she 's special , '' lucien stated . \\n▁ ` ` it will be intriguing to watch and see if these abilities form more fully and how . \\n▁ but i need to guard her , protect her in ways i did n't fathom when i began this . \\n▁ i need to protect her from those who would harm her because of what she means to their way of life , concubines who wish to halt a change or vampires who wish the same . \\n▁ i need to keep her abilities a secret . \\n▁ and i also need to protect her from these dreams . \\n▁ i shared her dream just last night . \\n▁ it 's hideous . \\n▁ simply her having them is bad enough . \\n▁ her physically experiencing them , i will not abide . \\n▁ her dying from one , i will not tolerate . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course not , '' isobel said softly . \\n▁ ` ` that 's terrible . '' \\n▁ ` ` it is , '' lucien agreed . \\n▁ ` ` now , we need to be certain etienne does n't discover these things . \\n▁ we also need to be certain that cressida nor even magdalene learn about what leah can do . \\n▁ and we need to be certain that leah does not learn from any of them about maggie or the fact that the additional component to the physical nature of our relationship is not commonplace with concubines . '' \\n▁ isobel lost her ability to hide her reactions and her mouth dropped open . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ julian asked . \\n▁ ` ` she does n't know ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , she does n't know , '' lucien answered , his children glanced at each other but wisely did not question this and lucien went on . \\n▁ ` ` also , julian , you need to keep a tight rein on your mother . \\n▁ leah is not like other concubines . \\n▁ she 's not even like other mortals . \\n▁ she 's spirited and unused to obedience . \\n▁ if cressida presses for a reaction , leah will likely give it to her and if that should happen , i will side with leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 'll side with leah ? '' \\n▁ julian asked . \\n▁ ` ` against a vampire ? '' \\n▁ ` ` absolutely , '' lucien answered . \\n▁ suddenly , isobel 's eyes narrowed and she queried , ` ` why are you both dreaming of the sentence ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no idea , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ isobel instantly shot her next question at him . \\n▁ ` ` do you intend to take her as your mate ? '' \\n▁ lucien felt his body go solid as he heard julian take in a sharp breath and he spoke low and slow when he answered , ` ` no , isobel , i do not . '' \\n▁ ` ` then why would you both be dreaming of the sentence ? '' \\n▁ she pushed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve answered that question , bel , '' lucien returned . \\n▁ isobel kept pushing . \\n▁ ` ` you obviously hold her in deep regard . \\n▁ you marked her twenty years ago . \\n▁ you ' ve stated you 'd back her even if she disrespected one of your own kind . \\n▁ and you 're putting yourself , your family , your friends and our way of life in danger and you 're saying all of that is just so you can f * * k her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` bel , '' julian hissed . \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ isobel snapped back , her eyes cutting to her brother . \\n▁ ` ` i want to know . \\n▁ i want to know what he 'd risk burning for . \\n▁ i heard she 's not hard on the eyes and she smells divine but no mortal blood and definitely no mortal pu * * y is worth burning . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , but you do n't have to be a bitch about it , '' julian bit out . \\n▁ but lucien had had enough . \\n▁ silence ! \\n▁ lucien commanded . \\n▁ both his children 's mouths clamped shut and when they turned to face him , he continued . \\n▁ be still , and their bodies locked . \\n▁ ` ` do not , '' he spoke aloud , his gaze on his daughter , ` ` ever speak that way in regards to leah . \\n▁ what i have with her and why i 'd risk what i 'd risk for her , if you do n't understand it when you see it , is none of your f * * king business . \\n▁ if you know nothing , you know me better than to think i 'd take this risk if it did n't mean something to me and that should be enough for the both of you . \\n▁ am i understood ? '' \\n▁ he freed their minds and isobel clenched her teeth but nodded . \\n▁ julian tipped up his chin . \\n▁ ` ` there will be no more talk of mates , '' lucien declared . \\n▁ julian tipped up his chin again but isobel pulled in a deep breath . \\n▁ then her face changed . \\n▁ it melted and it so reminded him of her mother who was the most gentle vampire he 'd ever known , much like maggie , that some of lucien 's temper fled . \\n▁ ` ` you 're loved , '' she said quietly . \\n▁ the rest of lucien 's temper fled and he replied , ` ` i know that , darling . '' \\n▁ she shook her head and looked to the water before she went on , ` ` i ' m just worried about you . \\n▁ i was n't around when vampires could take mortal mates but , '' her eyes came back to him , ` ` i heard that was what it was like . \\n▁ that they did n't respect vampires . \\n▁ that they were treated as equals . \\n▁ that - '' ` ` you 're wrong and you 're right , '' lucien interrupted her . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve never experienced a taming . \\n▁ it 's about respect and equality . \\n▁ but , bel , when you see leah with me , you 'll understand . '' \\n▁ he closed the distance between them , lifted his hand and put it to his daughter 's neck , his thumb moving to stroke her delicate jaw , also just like her mother 's before he murmured , ` ` i promise , my darling , you 'll understand . '' \\n▁ her black eyes hit his and it took a moment before her eyes grew warm and she nodded . \\n▁ lucien smiled at her and he received a hesitant smile in return . \\n▁ then he felt julian get close to them and both he and isobel looked to their sides to see julian grinning . \\n▁ ` ` seriously , '' he said through his grin , ` ` i ca n't wait to meet leah . '' \\n▁ * * * * * lucien strode into the guest house on the annoying errand of claiming his concubine to take her back to meet his family . \\n▁ the annoying part of this errand was the last part . \\n▁ the minute he entered , he saw her through the windows at the back of the house , sitting out on the deck in the sun , drinking coffee with her mother , aunts and avery . \\n▁ seeing her sitting there , smiling , the sun kissing her skin , glinting in her long , thick hair , he wondered if he would ever grow accustomed to her beauty . \\n▁ drinking it in , he decided he would not . \\n▁ he stopped only steps into the unit 's living room because he caught a familiar scent and heard a heart beating . \\n▁ he turned his head to the side and waited . \\n▁ it took only a moment for kate to walk into the living room from the small kitchen . \\n▁ she 'd been waiting for him . \\n▁ he knew this by the way she held her body and the expectant look on her face . \\n▁ ` ` kate , '' he greeted and he heard her heartbeat escalate as he smelled her fear . \\n▁ she had something to say . \\n▁ something she did n't want to say . \\n▁ something that was important enough for her to power through her fears to say it . \\n▁ and lastly , something that would take time . \\n▁ this was a nuisance . \\n▁ all of it . \\n▁ leah 's family being there , his as well . \\n▁ he 'd been waiting for leah for twenty years . \\n▁ and he 'd had one day , the length of which he was away , and one night of her being tamed . \\n▁ being his . \\n▁ and it was far better than he expected it would be . \\n▁ he wanted their families gone and his attention focused on nothing but leah with hers on nothing but him . \\n▁ and he did n't want this for the day . \\n▁ he did n't even want it for the next week . \\n▁ he wanted it for as long as he could keep hold of it . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , if you would n't mind , i 'd like a word , '' kate spoke quietly . \\n▁ he minded . \\n▁ but seeing as this was kate buchanan , the matriarch of the buchanan concubines , and leah 's aunt , lucien did what he did not wish to do . \\n▁ he lifted his chin to indicate assent . \\n▁ then he watched the indomitable kate buchanan press her lips together . \\n▁ fucking hell , she was nervous . \\n▁ he did n't have time for this . \\n▁ ` ` kate , please begin , '' he ordered . \\n▁ ` ` leah is in fine spirits this morning , '' kate noted and lucien 's head turned to the windows . \\n▁ through them he saw leah smiling at nadia , her manner relaxed , her beautiful face aglow , warmth emanating from her . \\n▁ even if their family dynamic was strange , it was clear she adored them and he liked that . \\n▁ but more , the taming was complete . \\n▁ she was not holding back , not hiding , not on guard . \\n▁ she was just leah . \\n▁ his leah . \\n▁ finally . \\n▁ ` ` she 's told us your family is at her house , '' kate went on and lucien 's eyes went to her . \\n▁ ` ` they are indeed , '' he confirmed and her head tilted to the side . \\n▁ ` ` etienne ? '' \\n▁ she asked quietly and lucien sighed with irritation . \\n▁ ` ` you have nothing to fear , kate . \\n▁ she 's safe under my protection , '' he assured her of something which she should not need assurances . \\n▁ even if leah was not who she was to him , she was his concubine and he was lucien . \\n▁ he 'd never allow anything to harm her . \\n▁ ` ` she feels that way , '' kate bizarrely replied . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked . \\n▁ ` ` she feels that way . \\n▁ safe . \\n▁ your family is at her home , there 's a possibility she 'll be meeting them and she 's not anxious in the slightest , '' kate explained . \\n▁ ` ` in fact , she 's quite content and even … '' she paused , ` ` cheery . '' \\n▁ lucien thought that was excellent . \\n▁ mainly he thought this because he knew it was he who made her that way . \\n▁ but leah in a relaxed , cheerful mood feeling safe under his care would aid greatly in her impending meeting with his family . \\n▁ kate kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` she has no idea she should be nervous with etienne there . \\n▁ even so , they are your family and you two have a. . . '' \\n▁ she hesitated then finished , ` ` special relationship . \\n▁ in normal circumstances , that is to say , amongst mortals who are starting a relationship , meeting each other 's families is a significant thing . '' \\n▁ lucien turned fully to her and crossed his arms on his chest . \\n▁ ` ` please , '' he invited , ` ` stop beating around the bush and explain what 's on your mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` my grandmother knew sasha , '' kate said softly and swiftly . \\n▁ lucien tensed . \\n▁ kate continued , ` ` this is , as you undoubtedly know , a story passed through the concubines now for decades . \\n▁ only cautionary , of course , but nevertheless it is well - known . \\n▁ but we xxunk , as my grandmother was confidant to sasha , know even more . \\n▁ except leah who , for obvious reasons , we kept this from . \\n▁ and leah feels safe with you , as she would . '' \\n▁ she hurried to say the last . \\n▁ ` ` but etienne , he 's … she 's … well , we both know leah and - '' he knew what she was saying . \\n▁ sasha , his father 's concubine some decades ago , was a legend and not in a good way . \\n▁ she was one of the rare concubines who had demanded to be released from her contract . \\n▁ and she was one of the very few who did so on the grounds of extreme cruelty . \\n▁ it was investigated and the dominion found that etienne regularly and often fed from his concubine without xxunk her , getting off on the agonizing pain he inflicted . \\n▁ obviously , she was released . \\n▁ she was also endowed with a fortune , this commanded by the dominion to be provided upon her by etienne . \\n▁ he was infuriated but he did it . \\n▁ he also never again treated a concubine in this manner . \\n▁ however he often engaged in this pastime elsewhere . \\n▁ it was the first such occurrence for over two hundred years and the last of its kind since then . \\n▁ it was not a secret the vampire etienne held no regard for mortals and this was only one incidence of proof of that fact . \\n▁ it was also not lost on kate that leah was spirited and rarely showed him the respect he was due . \\n▁ if pushed , she could earn etienne 's ire and his attention neither of which would be advantageous . \\n▁ especially not now . \\n▁ however , with his children and mother in attendance and leah tamed , he had matters in hand . \\n▁ therefore , lucien interrupted her . \\n▁ ` ` do not concern yourself with this . '' \\n▁ she leaned into him and whispered , ` ` lucien , you know i say this respectfully , but there is no way i can not concern myself with this . \\n▁ what you 're doing with leah … what you ' ve already done . \\n▁ etienne - '' ` ` kate , '' lucien cut her off , ` ` i 'll repeat this only once . \\n▁ this is not your concern . \\n▁ it 's mine . \\n▁ i am aware of it and i 'll keep leah safe . '' \\n▁ ` ` she 's dreaming of the sentence , '' kate reminded him . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m more aware of the meaning of that than you , '' lucien clipped , losing patience . \\n▁ ` ` okay then why ? \\n▁ and how ? '' \\n▁ kate pressed , her heartbeat escalating further , her breath coming faster . \\n▁ she was pushing him , she knew it . \\n▁ but she loved her niece and was concerned . \\n▁ for that reason , lucien sought patience . \\n▁ ` ` this i do n't know , '' lucien admitted through his teeth . \\n▁ ` ` then etienne being involved at this juncture , with so many unknowns , so many dangers - '' ` ` i will keep her safe , '' lucien repeated impatiently . \\n▁ ` ` she 's falling in love with you , '' kate blurted and lucien 's entire body went tense . \\n▁ kate saw it and leaned back then took a small step away from him . \\n▁ still , even as she moved away , her eyes studied him closely . \\n▁ then , quietly and with some surprise , she whispered , ` ` that eventuality had not occurred to you . '' \\n▁ she was wrong . \\n▁ stephanie had warned him of this possibility . \\n▁ cosmo had concerns of it . \\n▁ his children . \\n▁ but it could not happen . \\n▁ ` ` she is concubine , i ' m vampire . \\n▁ she 's mortal , i ' m immortal . \\n▁ she 's dreaming of the sentence and after i explained it to her , she knows what it means . \\n▁ it would be beyond foolhardy for her to fall in love with me . \\n▁ even before she knew of the sentence , she knew vampires did not mate with mortals . \\n▁ she knew this , '' lucien replied , feeling something in his gut . \\n▁ something new . \\n▁ something he had n't felt in centuries . \\n▁ something he only felt once in his very long life . \\n▁ something he felt with maggie . \\n▁ i love you . \\n▁ christ , he 'd heard it through her dreams . \\n▁ he 'd even heard it in his . \\n▁ christ ! \\n▁ could these dreams be xxunk ? \\n▁ no . \\n▁ it simply could not happen . \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve spent much time watching leah , hearing of her and now , being with her . \\n▁ but you still have much to learn about her , '' kate said softly , taking his attention back to her . \\n▁ lucien held kate 's eyes before he sighed . \\n▁ it was time to do something about this , for their families , those who cared about them and , especially , for leah . \\n▁ therefore he announced , ` ` i 'll speak to her . '' \\n▁ kate 's brows shot up . \\n▁ ` ` you mean , to tell her not to fall in love with you ? '' \\n▁ she asked incredulously . \\n▁ ` ` no , to remind her of things she should keep in the forefront of her mind through our time together . \\n▁ once i remind her of these things , she 'll stop herself from being controlled by these types of emotions . '' \\n▁ kate shook her head . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , this is leah we 're talking about . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , and she is far from stupid . \\n▁ i can see as our relationship has progressed , the intensity of feelings we ' ve shared , matters could cloud better judgment . \\n▁ i 'll simply call her attention to what she should bear in mind . '' \\n▁ ` ` you can do that , of course , and leah is clever . \\n▁ but lucien , i warn you if you have n't already noted this , my niece follows her heart . \\n▁ she 's ruled by emotion . \\n▁ she can understand something logically in her head but her feelings guide her , especially if they 're intense . \\n▁ her head has absolutely no sway over her emotions . '' \\n▁ ` ` then i 'll explain things fully , '' lucien returned and kate fell silent . \\n▁ when this lasted several moments , lucien enquired , ` ` are we finished ? '' \\n▁ ` ` one more thing , '' she answered quietly . \\n▁ ` ` one more , kate , '' lucien allowed , ` ` but make it fast . '' \\n▁ ` ` if you intend to have this talk with leah , please , i implore you , do it quickly . '' \\n▁ ` ` unfortunately , at this time there are a variety of other matters - '' lucien started and was surprised when kate cut him off . \\n▁ and she did this to whisper , ` ` make this a priority , please , for my niece . '' \\n▁ ` ` kate - '' ` ` she 's falling in love with you . '' \\n▁ ` ` and i will speak with her . '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , but you must do it soon … '' she hesitated and concern washed through her features as she finished , ` ` before she lands . '' \\n▁ lucien drew in breath . \\n▁ then he acquiesced , ` ` i 'll make it a priority . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' she whispered . \\n▁ lucien was done . \\n▁ he communicated this by tipping up his chin and moving toward the backdoor of the house . \\n▁ as he moved he noted avery sense his approach and lucien watched through the windows as avery rose and moved to the door . \\n▁ his eyes went to leah to see she 'd noticed avery 's departure . \\n▁ her gaze then came to the window , caught his and she smiled and waved . \\n▁ hello , my pet , he called to her . \\n▁ hello , darling , she replied . \\n▁ she meant it , calling him darling . \\n▁ he smiled back . \\n▁ avery came through the door . \\n▁ ` ` a moment , lucien . '' \\n▁ lucien stopped , his eyes going to avery , his control on his patience slipping . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll just head outside , '' kate murmured , slid past avery and lucien and out the door , closing it behind her . \\n▁ lucien leveled his gaze on avery , warning , ` ` i have very little time and less patience . '' \\n▁ ` ` only a moment , '' avery replied quickly . \\n▁ ` ` then take your moment , '' lucien allowed . \\n▁ ` ` gregor requests a meeting . '' \\n▁ lucien held his eyes but did n't expose his reaction . \\n▁ gregor was a member of the council . \\n▁ lucien had known him for years but , even so , he did n't know him at all . \\n▁ he could be ally , he could be enemy . \\n▁ centuries ago , gregor had shocked all vampires by denouncing his mortal mate during the hunt . \\n▁ he was the only vampire to do this . \\n▁ many did n't understand gregor 's actions , however lucien did . \\n▁ if maggie had lived , for her , he would have considered it . \\n▁ it was fortunately unfortunate that this decision never needed to be made . \\n▁ lucien , having had a mortal mate himself , could believe gregor denounced his mate to give her a longer mortal life , even if they had to live the sudden brevity without each other . \\n▁ this could mean that all these years , gregor was holding resentment about the loss of his mate . \\n▁ this meaning he desired vampires to have their freedoms restored , to have what he lost , if only the taming . \\n▁ it could also mean that , having lost his , that resentment could have turned bitter and he wished no other vampire to mate with mortals , not even for a taming . \\n▁ the only thing lucien had to go on with gregor was that he 'd taken a young mortal into his care after her parents were assassinated . \\n▁ lucien had never met the girl who now was a woman . \\n▁ however he had heard talk that gregor was devoted to her in his way . \\n▁ the vampire was cold but lucien sensed he was n't unfeeling . \\n▁ further , gregor 's son , yuri was attached to his father 's ward , perhaps xxunk . \\n▁ or at least the dominion would feel that way . \\n▁ this could work in his favor if gregor wished his son to be free to claim the mortal child he raised not only to keep her in the family but also to keep her alive for eternity . \\n▁ ` ` arrange it , '' he ordered avery . \\n▁ ` ` with stephanie and cosmo , '' avery added and lucien 's gaze sharpened on his face . \\n▁ ` ` why would he wish xxunk and cosmo to be there ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve no idea . \\n▁ he just does . '' \\n▁ lucien was silent a moment . \\n▁ he did n't like that gregor wished to speak with him and his two closest friends who would be his two chief lieutenants should hostilities escalate . \\n▁ further , having all of them there would mean he would be forced to leave leah unprotected as , at that juncture , he did not feel he could trust another vampire enough to add to her security detail . \\n▁ this could be a plot . \\n▁ it could also bode bad tidings . \\n▁ or it could mean further inroads into the council . \\n▁ he would n't know unless he took the chance and took the meeting . \\n▁ his protection of leah primarily involved his control of information shared with her , her interaction with vampires who might wish to frighten her into distrusting their culture , including lucien , thus driving her emotionally away from him and , most importantly , her sleep . \\n▁ edwina and leah herself would see to it that she did not slumber while he was absent . \\n▁ leah was not immune to fear but she 'd demonstrated more than once that she trusted him and she further admitted , xxunk , that she felt safe with him . \\n▁ if vampires were to approach with the intent to scare her , she might get frightened but she 'd await him to explain and make her feel safe . \\n▁ lucien did not fear for her experiencing bodily harm . \\n▁ being lucien , no vampire alive would be foolish enough to harm her physically . \\n▁ except katrina and his ex - mate only had the courage to act when pushed by emotion she was too weak in the heat of the moment to control . \\n▁ further , katrina had made it clear through copious communications with anyone who would listen that her emotion had shifted from anger irrationally directed at leah to anger at lucien . \\n▁ she was no longer a threat . \\n▁ but it would be lucien who told her , eventually , of the differences of their arrangement . \\n▁ it would be he , perhaps , who would share with her about maggie . \\n▁ and it was unlikely she would be approached by another vampire who wished to drive a wedge between them in the time it would take to have this meeting . \\n▁ making his decision , he repeated , ` ` arrange it . '' \\n▁ avery nodded . \\n▁ lucien dismissed him by moving his gaze to leah . \\n▁ he wanted no further delays . \\n▁ the sooner the meeting with his family was conducted , the sooner he could get them on their way . \\n▁ therefore , he called , tell your family good - bye , sweetling , and come to me . \\n▁ it was an order but not mind control . \\n▁ and he was pleased to see leah turn her head to look at him , tip it to the side then give him a small smile . \\n▁ then he watched as she did as she was told . \\n▁ lucien returned avery 's farewell and leah passed avery on her way in , stopping to get up on her toes to brush her lips to his cheek . \\n▁ then she came through the door , the small smile still on her face . \\n▁ ` ` is everything okay ? '' \\n▁ she asked as she arrived at him . \\n▁ not even close , he thought , studying her . \\n▁ she was beautiful . \\n▁ even more beautiful than maggie . \\n▁ and like maggie , leah 's beauty had depth . \\n▁ it was in the inquisitiveness of her eyes that did n't hide the warmth , a warmth she felt upon seeing him . \\n▁ it was in the hint of concern she also did n't hide . \\n▁ concern because she knew he was not pleased his family had arrived unannounced but further he 'd also taken her away without explanation before she could encounter a single one of them . \\n▁ it was in her bearing . \\n▁ the way she wore her clothes . \\n▁ the way she felt about her family . \\n▁ it was his knowledge that she could and would say or do practically anything and most of it he would find interesting or amusing . \\n▁ and none of it he would ever find boring . \\n▁ until the sun falls from the sky . \\n▁ the words of the ancient claiming ceremony hit his brain . \\n▁ any immortal would seek these things in his mate . \\n▁ beauty , depth , warmth , concern but more . \\n▁ eternity was just that and that was a very long time . \\n▁ any man would wish his mate to surprise him , amuse him , interest him and never , ever bore him . \\n▁ if they had five years or five hundred , leah would never bore him . \\n▁ he knew this in that instant right to the depths of his soul . \\n▁ until the sun falls from the sky . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ she called softly , her voice warm too , inquisitive , concerned . \\n▁ she moved into him and laid a hand light on his chest . \\n▁ ` ` is everything okay ? '' \\n▁ until the sun falls from the sky . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ kate was correct . \\n▁ he needed to discuss things with leah as a priority . \\n▁ finally , he answered , ` ` they will be , pet . \\n▁ we 're going home now to have lunch with my family . \\n▁ however , i need to speak with you before we return . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ she was still talking softly and getting closer . \\n▁ when she did , his arms slid around her . \\n▁ she relaxed into him . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ he had her . \\n▁ all of her . \\n▁ his . \\n▁ finally . \\n▁ until the sun falls from the sky . \\n▁ ` ` so , uh … '' she broke into his thoughts when he did n't speak , ` ` are we actually going to speak ? \\n▁ or are we going to stand here staring at each other ? '' \\n▁ lucien relaxed then grinned and told her , ` ` i could stand here and stare at you for some time , sweetling , but i suppose we should speak . '' \\n▁ at his grin , she relaxed deeper into him . \\n▁ at his words , even deeper and her face went soft . \\n▁ he liked that . \\n▁ all of it . \\n▁ and all of it was his . \\n▁ only his . \\n▁ until the sun falls from the sky . \\n▁ he drew in breath and addressed the matter at hand . \\n▁ ` ` at home are my children , julian and isobel . \\n▁ my mother , magdalene . \\n▁ my father , etienne . \\n▁ and julian 's mother , cressida . '' \\n▁ she looked into his eyes with interest until the last . \\n▁ when he mentioned cressida he saw something cut through her features before she wiped her face blank . \\n▁ and what he saw cutting through features he did not like . \\n▁ he did not like that she felt it and he did not like that her feeling it meant he felt it as well . \\n▁ ` ` leah , sweetheart , what we had was a very long time ago , '' he assured her and this was true , for mortals . \\n▁ for vampires , seeing as he ended the physical side of his relationship with cressida only fifty years ago , it was not . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she said quietly . \\n▁ ` ` there is nothing there , '' he told her . \\n▁ ` ` then why is she at our house ? '' \\n▁ our house . \\n▁ until the sun falls from the sky . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , um … '' leah went on , ` ` i do n't know how vampires roll but the ex is n't normally in on surprise family visits unless that family is a little bit weird . '' \\n▁ lucien again grinned . \\n▁ ` ` vampires are the same way . '' \\n▁ ` ` well then ? '' \\n▁ she prompted . \\n▁ ` ` cressida is … '' he searched for a word , ` ` unusual . '' \\n▁ her eyes slid away and she muttered , ` ` great . '' \\n▁ his arms gave her a squeeze and he regained her gaze . \\n▁ ` ` it is your home , leah , '' he dipped his face closer to hers and stated , ` ` our home . \\n▁ she will respect me in it and i will make certain she respects you . '' \\n▁ he watched her brows draw together . \\n▁ ` ` she would n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` cressida is unpredictable . '' \\n▁ ` ` great part two , '' she again muttered . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll need you to have patience with her , my pet . \\n▁ and i 'll need you be cautious around her . \\n▁ she will attempt to goad you . \\n▁ take the high road . '' \\n▁ leah stared up at him . \\n▁ then she whispered , ` ` uh … something to know about me . \\n▁ i ' m not very familiar with the high road . '' \\n▁ this time lucien smiled . \\n▁ ` ` i am aware of that but this time , you 'll need to embark on an adventure and discover it . '' \\n▁ she smiled back , humor lighting her eyes , making them luminescent , as she whispered , ` ` embark on an adventure . '' \\n▁ lucien very much wanted to savor the amusement he gave to leah but he did n't have the time . \\n▁ so he continued , ` ` cressida will be irritating . \\n▁ she will say things , perhaps even do things that might be maddening or even hurtful . \\n▁ do your best to ignore her . \\n▁ i 'll deal with her and i promise to talk through with you anything you may have questions about after she leaves . '' \\n▁ he waited for her nod , received it and went on , ` ` my father is another matter . '' \\n▁ her head tipped to the side . \\n▁ ` ` your father ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we do not share a close relationship , '' he disclosed . \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` not even slightly , '' he went on . \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' she repeated on a whisper . \\n▁ ` ` i do not like him . \\n▁ i do not respect him . \\n▁ and i do not trust him . \\n▁ he has reached out to isobel and therefore she brought him to our home . \\n▁ i ' ve had words with bel . \\n▁ but i can not know his intentions . \\n▁ he may be charming . \\n▁ he may be condescending . \\n▁ either way , you must treat him with respect no matter what . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay . '' \\n▁ she was still whispering . \\n▁ lucien 's arms gave her another squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` no matter what , leah . \\n▁ i 'll do my best to control him but , like cressida , he 's uncontrollable and unpredictable . \\n▁ the only thing i can ask is that you control your reactions . '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll control my reactions , lucien . '' \\n▁ after her immediate response , he studied her again . \\n▁ the inquisitiveness was gone . \\n▁ the warmth muted . \\n▁ the concern evident . \\n▁ he did not like this but he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i also ask you not to share anything about you and me , '' he went on . \\n▁ leah blinked . \\n▁ then she asked , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` nothing about us , leah . \\n▁ they know i live with you . \\n▁ they know you are my concubine . \\n▁ they know i hold deep regard for you . \\n▁ any personal information is not theirs to have . \\n▁ not your nightmares . \\n▁ none of your abilities . \\n▁ not what you are to me . '' \\n▁ he felt her body stiffen and she asked quietly , ` ` what i am to you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that we 're lovers . '' \\n▁ understandable confusion suffused her face and she started , ` ` but - '' ` ` it is none of their concern . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course not , '' she replied . \\n▁ ` ` but wo n't they know that already ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they would make that assumption , '' he lied . \\n▁ ` ` i simply wish you to avoid any discussion about it . \\n▁ any at all . '' \\n▁ her head tipped to the side again and the confusion in her features increased . \\n▁ ` ` why would they discuss it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` again , cressida and my father are uncontrollable and unpredictable . \\n▁ they may bring it up to provoke you . \\n▁ do n't be drawn in and if i ask you to leave the room , you do it . \\n▁ immediately . '' \\n▁ she stared at him a moment before she admitted , ` ` this is kind of freaking me out , lucien . '' \\n▁ his arms gave her another squeeze and his neck bent so he could touch his mouth too briefly to hers . \\n▁ when he lifted his head , he held her eyes . \\n▁ ` ` you feel safe with me , '' he reminded her , her lids lowered slowly for a languid blink he liked very much then she nodded . \\n▁ ` ` then you must trust me because i promise you , my pet , i will keep you safe . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she whispered . \\n▁ lucien sighed . \\n▁ then he stated , ` ` let 's go home . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' she repeated . \\n▁ he touched his mouth to hers again then let her go only to take her hand and draw her to the front door . \\n▁ he knew she turned back to the windows to wave to her family and avery . \\n▁ he did not . \\n▁ he took her out to his porsche and took her home . \\n▁ chapter twenty the lunch ` ` mother , '' lucien 's son hissed , ` ` stop it . '' \\n▁ she would n't . \\n▁ i knew this . \\n▁ i 'd been in cressida 's presence for an hour and i knew this . \\n▁ lucien 's ex was a total bitch . \\n▁ i hated her . \\n▁ i tried not to be a hater but she was the kind of woman that even mother theresa would consider bitch - slapping . \\n▁ but cressida was n't my concern . \\n▁ i was a woman . \\n▁ i 'd encountered bitches . \\n▁ it was lucien 's father etienne who gave me the creeps . \\n▁ and he did this because he enjoyed cressida playing with me . \\n▁ every catty comment out of her mouth , his eyes flashed with a sick happy light and they moved to me to assess my response . \\n▁ i did n't know how i knew it but i knew he was waiting for me to break no matter what way that was . \\n▁ to be hurt . \\n▁ to get angry . \\n▁ just as long as it was negative or damaging . \\n▁ vampires were human - ish . \\n▁ this meant that lucien shared this man 's dna which i found impossible to believe . \\n▁ lucien could be a jerk but he was a hot jerk who could be funny , sweet and gentle . \\n▁ etienne was none of these -lrb- except , damnably i had to admit , the hot part -rrb- and proud of it . \\n▁ if magdalene was n't sweet and openly loving , i would think she stepped out on etienne . \\n▁ there was nothing in lucien that was like his father . \\n▁ they did n't even look alike , etienne being blond and blue - eyed , tall but lean for a vampire . \\n▁ lucien looked like his mother . \\n▁ in fact , he was the uber - masculine image of her classically beautiful femininity . \\n▁ cressida turned her -lrb- damnably i had to admit , gorgeous -rrb- sky blue eyes to her son and asked with fake innocence , ` ` stop what ? '' \\n▁ julian glared at her then ordered , ` ` we need to talk in the study . '' \\n▁ she threw out an elegant hand to the dining table at which edwina was currently serving us dessert . \\n▁ ` ` but , we have n't finished lunch . '' \\n▁ julian pushed his chair back , declaring , ` ` you have . '' \\n▁ ` ` julian , do n't be rude , '' cressida returned . \\n▁ i looked to my lap and smiled because that was hilarious coming from her . \\n▁ she 'd been rude from the get - go when she took my hand , squeezed it and murmured , ` ` mm … tasty . '' \\n▁ ` ` study , mother , now , '' julian growled and i looked to lucien 's son . \\n▁ it was bizarre how lucien , who i knew was over eight hundred years old but this did n't penetrate considering his looks and vitality , had two grown children . \\n▁ it was also bizarre that his parents looked like his contemporaries . \\n▁ and it was equally bizarre how both his children clearly got the best selections in the gene pool they were offered . \\n▁ julian was gorgeous in his father 's raw , manly way . \\n▁ isobel was beautiful in what had to have been her mother 's delicate way but lucien was still stamped all over her . \\n▁ i liked them both . \\n▁ they were obviously close and affectionate with each other , their father and their grandmother and , until now , patient with cressida . \\n▁ they also were cautious and watchful with their grandfather which meant they were far from stupid . \\n▁ and they were kind and welcoming to me which was nice . \\n▁ on this thought , i heard lucien command , ` ` go with julian . '' \\n▁ my head came up and i looked down the table to the head where lucien was sitting . \\n▁ i was at the foot . \\n▁ lucien seated me where i was and i did n't think anything was amiss with this , considering it was my house . \\n▁ but when he did this , the rest exchanged looks and i jotted this down on my mental list of what to talk to lucien about later . \\n▁ he was also glaring at cressida and it was clear he did not find anything amusing . \\n▁ cressida looked to lucien and grinned xxunk , ` ` i do n't want to miss edwina 's dessert . '' \\n▁ her head then turned to me and she finished . \\n▁ ` ` i ' ve known edwina for years . \\n▁ she 's the best cook . \\n▁ do n't you agree ? '' \\n▁ her meaning was clear . \\n▁ see ? \\n▁ total bitch . \\n▁ ` ` you can go or i can carry you , '' lucien bit out , cressida looked to him and i pressed my lips together . \\n▁ ` ` oh , '' she purred , her eyes flaring with a sultry light , her face softening seductively . \\n▁ neither of which i liked . \\n▁ neither of which i could do a thing about . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll take the second option . '' \\n▁ bitch . \\n▁ lucien opened his mouth to speak but i took my chances and got there before him . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , really , cressida 's right . \\n▁ no one should miss edwina 's dessert , '' i stated . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes cut to me but i looked to cressida . \\n▁ ` ` as you can see , '' i pointed to the bowl edwina had set in front of me , ` ` it looks delicious . \\n▁ of course , if you wish to chat with julian and not tax yourself after that rich lunch , lucien can carry you to the study . '' \\n▁ i shrugged and smiled at her . \\n▁ ` ` anything goes in casa leah . \\n▁ so , whatever you wish . '' \\n▁ cressida 's eyes narrowed on me . \\n▁ my smile got bigger . \\n▁ i heard isobel chuckle . \\n▁ cressida 's eyes narrowed further . \\n▁ i forced myself to quit smiling . \\n▁ ` ` the buchanan smell . '' \\n▁ this came from etienne and i looked to him to see he was studying me in a way that made my flesh crawl . \\n▁ ` ` i have , of course , smelled it at selections over the years but have n't partaken . \\n▁ you , my dear , have changed that . \\n▁ i believe you have cousins who 'll be attending their selections soon ? '' \\n▁ he asked but did n't wait for me to answer . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be certain to arrange it so i ' m free of concubine and i 'll act quickly at their selections to declare my intentions . '' \\n▁ oh yes , my flesh was crawling and i tasted bile considering it suddenly crept up my throat . \\n▁ i did n't want my cousins to service this man and my eyes flew to lucien to communicate this fact . \\n▁ the instant they caught his , his locked on mine and they were intense . \\n▁ i knew what that meant and i swallowed the bile , deciding i disliked etienne even more considering he put me off edwina 's dessert . \\n▁ i did n't know what it was but by the looks of it she 'd used a heavy hand with whipped cream so i also did n't care . \\n▁ now i knew i 'd have to force it down . \\n▁ i pulled in a breath , looked back at etienne and lied quietly , ` ` i ' m sure they 'd be honored . '' \\n▁ actually , what i was sure of was that i 'd warn my aunties about this and prepare my cousins for this eventuality . \\n▁ they could refuse him and would have to wait for another selection but it would be worth it . \\n▁ ` ` and how do you find serving your master ? '' \\n▁ etienne asked what i considered a rude question . \\n▁ i had n't sat down to lunch with vampires , except , of course , lucien and stephanie , but what i did for and with lucien was personal , not a topic for luncheon conversation . \\n▁ and i did n't like the way he put it . \\n▁ lucien had called himself my master in the beginning so i guessed this was accepted language in their culture . \\n▁ but i still did n't think the way etienne phrased this was nice . \\n▁ my gaze again went to lucien to see his jaw was hard and his eyes were still intent . \\n▁ i was right , it might be accepted language but etienne was n't being nice . \\n▁ i forced myself to smile a small smile at lucien , take in the elegant dining room where we were seated and i looked back at etienne . \\n▁ ` ` i believe i ' ve done well , '' i replied . \\n▁ ` ` at least for my part . \\n▁ you 'd have to ask lucien if he agrees . '' \\n▁ ` ` oh , lucien always enjoys his meals to their fullest , '' cressida put in . \\n▁ i fought against my back going straight even as i felt the air in the room get thick but she was n't done . \\n▁ ` ` of course , considering all that is you , he 's enjoying it even more . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's enough . '' \\n▁ this was said quietly and surprisingly by magdalene and all eyes went to her to see she was looking at cressida . \\n▁ ` ` you are at leah 's table in leah 's home eating leah 's food . \\n▁ she is concubine . \\n▁ she is buchanan . \\n▁ and you have repeatedly disrespected her , '' magdalene went on , again quietly , her voice soft and if it was n't for the sharp look in her eyes , you would n't know she was angry . \\n▁ but that sharp look in her eyes , so sharp it was piercing , you could n't mistake it . \\n▁ magdalene was n't done . \\n▁ ` ` i know for a fact that if lucien referred to your xxunk as your ` meal ' , you 'd challenge him without hesitation . \\n▁ and yet here you sit , at his concubine 's table in her presence and his and treat them both to your insolence . \\n▁ i ' ve shown you patience , cressida , until now . \\n▁ one more demonstration of your lack of regard for this family , it will be me who challenges you . '' \\n▁ cressida 's brows went up . \\n▁ ` ` this family ? '' \\n▁ magdalene sat back . \\n▁ ` ` are you not seated at a table with your son , his sister , their grandparents ? '' \\n▁ ` ` are you not xxunk that leah is family ? '' \\n▁ cressida shot back . \\n▁ ` ` if that is what you wish to read into my statement , be my guest . \\n▁ i , for one , '' her eyes intriguingly slid to etienne before going back to cressida , ` ` hold my concubines in deep regard so i have no issue with that . '' \\n▁ cressida had no retort . \\n▁ it was clear she did n't like this because her face went hard and her nose scrunched . \\n▁ magdalene dismissed her and looked at me . \\n▁ ` ` my apologies , leah . \\n▁ i ' m deeply sorry we ' ve intruded on you and my son only for you to be treated to this behavior . '' \\n▁ ` ` good christ , '' etienne muttered in clear contempt . \\n▁ ` ` apologies to a concubine ? '' \\n▁ i so did not like lucien 's father . \\n▁ but with effort i ignored him , held magdalene 's eyes and said quietly , ` ` thank you . '' \\n▁ she nodded to me and her face went soft . \\n▁ i so did like lucien 's mother . \\n▁ i smiled at her , picked up my spoon and forced myself to take a bite of dessert . \\n▁ i was right . \\n▁ lots of whipped cream with a hint of strawberries and chunks of moist , rich yellow cake . \\n▁ i was also wrong . \\n▁ even the antics of lucien 's crazy family did n't make me not enjoy edwina 's scrumptious dessert . \\n▁ edwina was a genius . \\n▁ i was scooping up more dessert when i heard in my head , i ' m proud of you , pet . \\n▁ i kept my attention on my bowl when i replied , thank you , darling . \\n▁ only when i swallowed my next bite did i look to lucien . \\n▁ his eyes were on me . \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ he grinned back . \\n▁ i liked that . \\n▁ therefore my grin got bigger and i gave him a smile i had no idea was dazzling . \\n▁ not even when lucien 's eyes warmed and his face got soft upon witnessing it . \\n▁ then i turned my attention back to my bowl and thus missed his family again exchanging glances . \\n▁ some were relieved . \\n▁ some were hard . \\n▁ all were knowing . \\n▁ * * * * * it was after dessert and coffee . \\n▁ lucien had come down to my end of the table to pull out my chair , help me up and guide me out of the room with his hand at the small of my back . \\n▁ we were walking through the double doors when i saw magdalene and isobel were hovering . \\n▁ as was cressida , if further away . \\n▁ julian and etienne were moving to the formal living room which i found a relief . \\n▁ no lounging in the comfy seating area off the kitchen for etienne . \\n▁ no way . \\n▁ i was wondering if i could tell them i needed to powder my nose and lucien had to help me whereupon i would barricade us in our bathroom until they all went away when magdalene came forward and wrapped her fingers around my elbow . \\n▁ ` ` girl talk , '' she said on a smile tipped up to her son . \\n▁ i felt lucien 's body get tight even as mine did the same . \\n▁ ` ` oh goodie ! '' \\n▁ cressida exclaimed . \\n▁ my body got tighter and lucien 's hand pressed into the small of my back ` ` magdalene said ` girl talk ' , cressida , not cat talk , '' isobel stated instantly , cressida sliced her a look but lucien relaxed and i did too . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll behave , '' cressida declared , i knew lying through her teeth . \\n▁ ` ` no you wo n't , '' isobel returned , knowing , better than me , cressida was full of it . \\n▁ ` ` reap what you sow , '' magdalene stated in her quiet voice . \\n▁ ` ` you came here full of curiosity , like a cat , and recklessly indulged yourself in that curiosity , like a cat . \\n▁ now you bear the consequences . '' \\n▁ not giving cressida the opportunity to reply , but i got a funny feeling i did n't like all that much when her angry eyes cut through me , magdalene drew me away . \\n▁ then i saw lucien give his daughter a look and felt his hand slide around my waist to curl at its side . \\n▁ i stopped and looked up at him just in time for his mouth to touch mine . \\n▁ when his head lifted slightly , he said gently but i still knew it was an order , ` ` do n't be long . '' \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ i could do not long . \\n▁ i could definitely do not long . \\n▁ i had to say , it freaked me out he was so cautious about me being with his family . \\n▁ sure , they were strange and he 'd forewarned me about cressida and etienne but i sensed there was more . \\n▁ i needed to ask him , edwina or stephanie about this . \\n▁ i did n't know if i missed this when i missed my studies . \\n▁ perhaps concubines did n't socialize with a vampire 's family and his was just weird or weirdly nosy . \\n▁ i did know , whatever was happening , lucien did n't like it . \\n▁ he let me go and magdalene drew me away . \\n▁ i followed as did isobel . \\n▁ neither woman talked even after we moved outside . \\n▁ and they continued their silence as they moved me to the trail that led to the pier . \\n▁ i knew what this meant . \\n▁ they did n't want their family 's vampire hearing to catch our conversation . \\n▁ i was n't certain this was good . \\n▁ i was so uncertain , we walked in silence to the pier and when we arrived i was a bundle of nerves . \\n▁ ` ` you can relax , leah , we 're all friends here , '' magdalene assured me softly as we moved onto the wooden slats , the serenity of the lake all around us . \\n▁ a serenity that did nothing to calm me . \\n▁ she could hear my heart , i knew , and read me . \\n▁ ` ` we just wanted to apologize personally for showing up out - of - the blue and bringing etienne and cressida , '' isobel added when we stopped . \\n▁ ` ` i hope you see they both need to be handled with care . '' \\n▁ oh , i saw that all right . \\n▁ ` ` of course , '' i murmured . \\n▁ ` ` when we return to the house , we 'll do our best to conclude the visit swiftly , '' magdalene told me . \\n▁ ` ` no , that 's unnecessary , '' i semi - lied seeing as i liked them . \\n▁ i just did n't like etienne and cressida . \\n▁ ` ` stay as long as you like . \\n▁ lucien is enjoying his time with you . '' \\n▁ that last was also a semi - lie . \\n▁ they 'd both known lucien for a long time -lrb- and that long for them was long -rrb- therefore they both burst into laughter . \\n▁ slightly sobering , magdalene 's hand came up and squeezed my bicep before she dropped it and said , ` ` i appreciate the sacrifice you 'd make for my son but as gracious as that is , we 'll do our best to conclude the visit . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i whispered then rallied , ` ` but , just so you know , '' i emphasized the ` ` you '' so they 'd understand exactly which ` ` yous '' i was talking about , ` ` you 're welcome anytime . \\n▁ edwina likes company , so do i and lucien has shared with me his fondness for the both of you . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's very kind , leah , '' isobel replied softly . \\n▁ ` ` and to return the kindness , '' magdalene pulled a business card shaped piece of paper out of the pocket of her awesome , tailored , loose - legged slacks and offered it to me , ` ` this is our contact information . \\n▁ bel 's and mine . \\n▁ if you should need anything , '' her eyes held mine , hers communicating something i did n't get but something i was n't sure i liked , ` ` anything , leah , call on us . '' \\n▁ what was this all about ? \\n▁ taking the card from her , cautiously i asked , ` ` are you talking about the trouble lucien is in ? '' \\n▁ magdalene 's head tilted slightly to the side but her face gave away nothing . \\n▁ ` ` trouble ? '' \\n▁ uh - oh . \\n▁ maybe she did n't know lucien was hauled away in the middle of the night by the council . \\n▁ she might look like his sister but she was his mom and that probably would n't be stellar news . \\n▁ ` ` uh … '' i mumbled to cover . \\n▁ it was lame but i did n't know where else to go . \\n▁ ` ` do you know of father 's troubles with the council ? '' \\n▁ isobel asked , clearly knowing herself and not afraid to mention it in front of magdalene which meant she knew too so i relaxed . \\n▁ ` ` not , um … exactly . \\n▁ i know he had an , uh … visit from them but he has n't shared more , '' i answered . \\n▁ ` ` actually , '' magdalene cut in , ` ` that card is for you to use whenever you feel you need it , my dear . \\n▁ whatever concerns you have . \\n▁ whatever you wish to discuss . \\n▁ my son endures an interest amongst our people that can be trying . \\n▁ not only for him but for those with whom he shares his time . \\n▁ we just wished you to know , regardless of how cressida and etienne behaved at lunch , that you have his family 's support , a listening ear , whatever you need . '' \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ that was super nice . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i replied quietly . \\n▁ ` ` whatever you need , '' magdalene repeated , getting slightly closer to me in a way i found xxunk both reassuring and a little scary . \\n▁ great , now lucien 's mother was causing me to have bizarre , conflicting emotions . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i was still talking quietly , ` ` thank you . '' \\n▁ her hand came up and she again gave my arm another squeeze . \\n▁ i smiled then looked to the path and then back to the women . \\n▁ ` ` i really should get back to lucien , '' i told them . \\n▁ ` ` as you know , he 's not a big fan of his father , cressida worked his nerves at lunch and he can sometimes have a temper . \\n▁ i do n't know you all very well but i ' m thinking julian working on his own ca n't keep the beast at bay . \\n▁ and anyway , lucien would much rather spend time with you so maybe we should return . '' \\n▁ ` ` i see you have grown to know my son well , '' magdalene noted in her soft voice . \\n▁ ` ` he 's an immensely xxunk guy , '' i replied and heard isobel chuckle . \\n▁ ` ` i mean , he 's a guy you 'd want to know , uh … immensely , '' i clarified stupidly . \\n▁ ` ` a guy , '' isobel murmured , amusement vibrating in her voice . \\n▁ ` ` it 's refreshing , my dear , '' magdalene started and my attention went to her , ` ` to see my son with someone , anyone , who enjoys his company , his company , without veneration . '' \\n▁ well , i worshipped her son but not in a way i 'd share with her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m pleased you find that refreshing , '' i told her and she moved into me again , this time to slide an arm around my waist and turn me back to the path . \\n▁ ` ` let 's get to know each other better , you and i , '' she stated as she started us on our way , isobel following . \\n▁ ` ` use that card to call on me just to chat . '' \\n▁ ` ` me too , '' isobel called from behind us . \\n▁ wow , totally nice . \\n▁ they completely made up for cressida being a bitch and etienne being super - creepy . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i agreed . \\n▁ ` ` and perhaps we 'll return . \\n▁ take you to lunch , just girls . \\n▁ maybe shopping , '' magdalene went on . \\n▁ i would love that . \\n▁ i did n't share that . \\n▁ i just said , ` ` that 'd be great . \\n▁ maybe we can invite stephanie . '' \\n▁ ` ` excellent idea , '' magdalene stated on a waist squeeze . \\n▁ we were on the path , woods surrounding us when it hit me and i found my feet suddenly stopping . \\n▁ thus i stopped magdalene with me and isobel was forced to halt behind us . \\n▁ i turned to them , moving out of the curve of magdalene 's arm and that was when i found my mouth moving . \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ lucien … he 's shared with me a variety of things and i. . . \\n▁ well , being me , being mortal , i mean , it 's very hard to wrap my mind around them . \\n▁ but at lunch , i was worried … um , i mean to say … '' damn ! \\n▁ i was screwing this up ! \\n▁ i took in a deep breath and forged on , ` ` what i mean is , he 's very strong but still , i sense he 's suffered . \\n▁ that will happen to everyone at times in their lives , i know . \\n▁ it would just suck if it happened to you and you did n't have good people , family , friends , at your back . \\n▁ at lunch i worried that he did n't . '' \\n▁ my eyes took them both in and i finished quietly , ` ` i ' m glad to know that he does . '' \\n▁ magdalene 's normally soft , friendly face got softer and friendlier . \\n▁ isobel , who played her cards closer to her vest , smiled a genuine , heartfelt smile . \\n▁ i kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` lucien would never thank you and it is n't my place to do it but i ' m going to do it anyway . \\n▁ so , uh … thank you . '' \\n▁ magdalene looked at isobel , isobel looked at magdalene then magdalene again moved into me and wrapped her hand around my elbow . \\n▁ she turned us and moved us forward but she did this walking close and saying softly , ` ` and thank you , my dear . \\n▁ it 's lovely to know my son spends his time with a woman who cares . '' \\n▁ ` ` i do , '' i said softly back and , actually -lrb- shocker -rrb- i did . \\n▁ her fingers gave my elbow a squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` good , '' she murmured and i looked to the side to see her facing forward , her expression thoughtful but content . \\n▁ then i threw a look behind me and caught lucien 's beautiful daughter 's smile . \\n▁ totally weird . \\n▁ either one of them could be his sister . \\n▁ still , i smiled back . \\n▁ then i concentrated on walking close to lucien 's mother as we made our way back to her son . \\n▁ * * * * * wearing a raspberry satin nightie with a deep edge of black lace at the bottom , i wandered out of the dressing room , through the bathroom and into the bedroom . \\n▁ although magdalene and isobel had been true to their promise to conclude the visit from lucien 's family shortly after we returned , five minutes after they left , my family descended . \\n▁ this did not make lucien happy and his frustration was apparent . \\n▁ he only put a clamp on it when aunt kate explained their plane left early the next morning and that evening was the last opportunity they had to visit with me . \\n▁ therefore , they stayed for dinner and beyond , leaving only fifteen minutes ago . \\n▁ however , during their visit they were all watchful of lucien and me . \\n▁ i did n't get the opportunity to ask them to explain though it felt weirdly like they were taking our pulse after the visit from lucien 's family . \\n▁ the second we walked back from me giving them hugs and kisses at their rental car and lucien closed the front door of the house , he turned , looked down at me and growled , ` ` bed . '' \\n▁ i felt his growl in secret , happy places and this feeling was so strong , i totally forgot i wanted to ask him about his family and my family seemingly worried about my visit with them . \\n▁ so i called my goodnight to edwina and xxunk up the stairs to peruse my lingerie drawer for lucien 's next treat . \\n▁ as i changed , i heard him in the bathroom brushing his teeth . \\n▁ then i heard him leave the bathroom . \\n▁ now i was walking through the bedroom to see he was as he was last night . \\n▁ reclined against the headboard , chest bared , book in hand but eyes on me . \\n▁ he immediately flipped his book shut and set it on his nightstand . \\n▁ i immediately walked to him , put a knee in the bed , threw my other leg around and settled astride his hips . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't use a bookmark , '' i noted , moving my hands to rest them lightly on his upper gut . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he answered shortly as i felt his stomach muscles tighten even with my light touch . \\n▁ power . \\n▁ my power over the mighty vampire lucien . \\n▁ i liked that . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ i tipped my head to the side . \\n▁ ` ` do you memorize the page number or something ? '' \\n▁ ` ` do you really care ? '' \\n▁ he shot back . \\n▁ i smiled at him . \\n▁ ` ` no . '' \\n▁ his hands came to my hips . \\n▁ i felt the pads of his fingers press in and just with that , my body heated . \\n▁ ` ` i like your kids , '' i whispered , sliding my hands up slightly , my torso moving down a smidgeon as i did . \\n▁ ` ` good , '' he muttered , sliding his hands up too , pulling me down a smidgeon more . \\n▁ ` ` and your mom is lovely , '' i told him , my hands sliding up more as i bent just a touch closer . \\n▁ ` ` she is , '' he agreed , his hands doing the same , pulling me closer . \\n▁ that was when i moved down . \\n▁ folding one of my arms between us , the other hand slid up to curve around his strong jaw as my thumb slid out to glide along his beautiful lips . \\n▁ ` ` i like that for you , '' i whispered and he blinked . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're mighty vampire lucien , '' i told him and felt his lips twitch . \\n▁ ` ` but even superheroes need good folks at their backs . \\n▁ batman has robin and that butler guy . \\n▁ iron man has that dude in the military and pepper potts . \\n▁ spiderman has aunt may . \\n▁ the fantastic four are , well … four . \\n▁ and - '' ` ` you do n't have to recite your knowledge of all things superhero , sweetling , '' lucien said against my thumb , his voice vibrating with humor . \\n▁ ` ` i think i ' ve got it . '' \\n▁ my thumb swept his cheekbone and i repeated softly , ` ` i like that for you . '' \\n▁ ` ` there 's a problem with this scenario , '' lucien noted and my head tilted . \\n▁ ` ` what problem ? '' \\n▁ suddenly i found myself on my back with lucien 's weight on top of me and his lips brushing mine . \\n▁ ` ` superheroes do n't often get the girl , '' he murmured against my lips and that made my body heat more . \\n▁ ` ` okay , then you 're a new , better , real kind of superhero who gets laid regularly , '' i murmured back , my hands traveling light on his skin . \\n▁ ` ` better ? '' \\n▁ he whispered , his hands traveling light on the satin of my nightie . \\n▁ ` ` oh yeah , '' i whispered back . \\n▁ his mouth grinned against mine and i watched up close as his eyes got smug . \\n▁ that used to annoy me . \\n▁ now i thought it was hot . \\n▁ i wrapped my legs around his h * ps as his lips trailed down my cheek to my ear . \\n▁ one of his hands pushed between me and the bed so his arm could wrap around me tight . \\n▁ his tongue touched the skin under my ear then his lips moved against it . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m going to feed from you , my pet . '' \\n▁ my whole body trembled . \\n▁ lucien was n't done . \\n▁ ` ` and i ' m going to do it everywhere . '' \\n▁ oh yes . \\n▁ that sounded nice . \\n▁ he kept going . \\n▁ ` ` there will be places you 'll be numb . '' \\n▁ hmm . \\n▁ that did n't sound nice . \\n▁ he went on . \\n▁ ` ` but there 'll be other , better places where you absolutely will not . '' \\n▁ goodie ! \\n▁ ` ` are you ready ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ was he crazy ? \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i breathed . \\n▁ he lifted his head so his burning eyes caught mine and my entire body felt the burn . \\n▁ then in a blur of motion he was between my legs . \\n▁ i felt his tongue run along the inside of my thigh as his finger ran feather - light along the outside edge of my panties between my legs . \\n▁ another full body shiver . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ i was right . \\n▁ this was nice . \\n▁ he repeated , his tongue running up my thigh , his finger running over my panties between my legs . \\n▁ my womb spasmed and i whimpered . \\n▁ then i felt him feed from my thigh as his finger pressed in at the perfect spot over my panties and my h * ps surged up as my neck arched and my eyes closed . \\n▁ definitely right . \\n▁ nice . \\n▁ * * * * * god , god . \\n▁ i thought i had the best the night before , the excruciatingly beautiful intensity of that morning . \\n▁ but now , lucien crouched back on his calves , me straddling him , his h * ps powering up , his c * * k ramming into me , his mouth at my neck feeding from me , his big hand curled at my cheek , his thumb in my mouth and i was sucking , i knew this was the best . \\n▁ my h * ps jerked , it was almost on me and he sensed it . \\n▁ his thumb slid out of my mouth but only to glide along my lips before it happened . \\n▁ then his thumb slid back in sideways and my teeth automatically clamped down on it as my h * ps bucked . \\n▁ a moan stuck in my throat , my arms clenched him tight and my back arched , pressing my torso into his hard body . \\n▁ through my overpowering orgasm i vaguely felt his tongue lash the wound at my neck . \\n▁ his thumb moved from between my teeth so his fist could clench in my hair to position my head where he wanted it . \\n▁ then his mouth was on mine as his c * * k kept driving up inside me , filling me so full it felt like he was an essential part of me . \\n▁ ` ` when you come , the world stops , '' he growled against my lips as i kept trembling through my orgasm . \\n▁ ` ` the whole world becomes nothing but you , your pu * * y , your pu * * y taking my c * * k and me . '' \\n▁ oh god , just his words and tone were going to make me come again . \\n▁ ` ` darling , '' i whispered , holding tighter as my body jolted with his thrusts . \\n▁ ` ` eight hundred , twenty - two years , i ' ve never felt anything this beautiful , '' he whispered , still driving and my eyes , half - closed , shot open . \\n▁ oh god . \\n▁ i loved that he thought that . \\n▁ he was n't done . \\n▁ his gaze held mine . \\n▁ ` ` eight hundred , twenty - two years , i ' ve never seen anything this beautiful . '' \\n▁ oh god . \\n▁ god ! \\n▁ ` ` i could f * * k you for eternity , '' he whispered . \\n▁ my hands slid up and fisted in his hair as my h * ps bucked again . \\n▁ ` ` lucien . '' \\n▁ ` ` eternity , '' he murmured against my lips then his head slanted , his mouth claimed mine , our tongues dueled and his thrusts became savage . \\n▁ then i was on my back in the bed taking the force of him between my legs and it was pure brutal beauty . \\n▁ his mouth broke from mine , he buried his face in my neck as he buried his c * * k in me and i listened to the power of his groan . \\n▁ i gave him that . \\n▁ me . \\n▁ just who i was . \\n▁ all that i was . \\n▁ i gave him that . \\n▁ i made him feel that beauty . \\n▁ my beauty was what he saw . \\n▁ i loved that . \\n▁ he barely finished before he rolled to his back , taking me with him , keeping himself a part of me . \\n▁ when he settled , one strong arm held me tight around my back and his other hand in my hair pressed my face in my throat . \\n▁ ` ` christ , i ' m sorry , leah . '' \\n▁ i blinked at his throat . \\n▁ these were words i did n't expect to hear . \\n▁ i lifted my head to look down at him . \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ he even looked sorry . \\n▁ ` ` you 're sorry ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sweetling , '' he replied gently , his black eyes filled with remorse , his hand sliding out of my hair to cup my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` for what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` for taking you that hard . '' \\n▁ was he serious ? '' \\n▁ ` ` uh , darling , it seems you might have missed this but i liked it , '' i informed him . \\n▁ his thumb slid along my cheek as his eyes moved over my face . \\n▁ then his eyes came back to mine and he murmured , ` ` you are n't lying . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would i lie about that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because that would be what i wanted to hear . '' \\n▁ it was my turn for my eyes to move over his face . \\n▁ cautiously , i asked , ` ` do people tell you what you want to hear often ? '' \\n▁ ` ` except for cosmo , xxunk and occasionally others , always . '' \\n▁ i felt my lips part and my eyes grow wide . \\n▁ whoa . \\n▁ i did n't know what to do with that . \\n▁ ` ` seriously ? '' \\n▁ i asked in amazement , the shadow moved out of his handsome face and he grinned . \\n▁ ` ` seriously , '' he answered . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't know if that 's cool or if that would suck , '' i shared . \\n▁ ` ` the latter , '' lucien clarified . \\n▁ i tipped my head to the side even as i dipped it closer to his and i grinned before saying , ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ i think it would be cool to have everyone tell me what i want to hear . \\n▁ like , ` leah , your butt absolutely does not look big in that . ' \\n▁ and , ` oh no , this xxunk sauce is n't runny and disgusting . \\n▁ it tastes great . ' \\n▁ stuff like that . '' \\n▁ lucien 's hand left my face so that arm could also wrap tight around me and his h * ps adjusted slightly so he slid out of me as he grinned . \\n▁ then he stated , ` ` for the record , your ass never looks big in anything . '' \\n▁ ` ` good to know , '' i said through my smile . \\n▁ ` ` but please , do n't attempt xxunk sauce . '' \\n▁ i burst out laughing and as i was doing it , lucien rolled me to my back . \\n▁ we ended with his torso on mine but most of his weight on a forearm in the bed beside me . \\n▁ i was still giggling and although lucien was smiling a beautiful smile , he was n't laughing . \\n▁ he was watching and he was doing it like he liked what he saw . \\n▁ and i liked that . \\n▁ ` ` all right , darling , '' i replied . \\n▁ ` ` i wo n't attempt xxunk sauce . \\n▁ but i 'll inform you that this is mostly because i already have about seven thousand times . \\n▁ i ' ve always ruined it so i know that 's a road i should n't go down . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is good , '' he muttered , his eyes holding humor . \\n▁ ` ` but i make no such assurances about xxunk sauce . \\n▁ i think i could kick some xxunk ass . '' \\n▁ lucien kept muttering as his eyes kept dancing when he said , ` ` heaven help me . '' \\n▁ ` ` just saying , '' i muttered back . \\n▁ he held my eyes , his still lit with amusement then i watched the amusement die and he said quietly , ` ` we must talk . '' \\n▁ i sighed . \\n▁ then i replied , ` ` i know , '' and finished , ` ` cressida . '' \\n▁ his head jerked slightly and he asked , ` ` cressida ? '' \\n▁ ` ` darling , i have to say , and please , no offense but i ' m concerned you 're into me considering the two other women that have been in your life that i ' ve met . \\n▁ am i like them ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not in any way , '' he stated firmly . \\n▁ interesting . \\n▁ ` ` then why did you pick them ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not certain you want to know . '' \\n▁ i totally did . \\n▁ ` ` call me crazy but i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` then i 'll amend my response , '' lucien returned . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m not certain i want to tell you because , having you , i ' m no longer certain why i chose them . '' \\n▁ oh my god . \\n▁ that was sweet . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' i whispered . \\n▁ lucien changed the subject . \\n▁ ` ` but that is n't what we need to talk about . '' \\n▁ i nodded and said , ` ` the table thing . '' \\n▁ lucien 's brows drew together . \\n▁ ` ` pardon ? '' \\n▁ i fluttered my hand in the air and explained , ` ` the table thing . \\n▁ i saw it . \\n▁ when you seated me at the foot everyone went kind of weird . \\n▁ what was that ? '' \\n▁ ` ` tradition , '' lucien answered . \\n▁ ` ` you 're a mortal and you were amongst vampires . \\n▁ my mother would normally take the foot . '' \\n▁ i did n't think that was good . \\n▁ ` ` then why 'd you seat me there ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because it 's your house , your place and my seating you there was my way of telling them they should respect you in it . \\n▁ unfortunately , even this did not deter cressida and my father from behaving badly . '' \\n▁ he was right about that . \\n▁ still . \\n▁ ` ` i hope your mother was n't offended , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` she understood why i did it and therefore she was n't . '' \\n▁ well , that was good . \\n▁ lucien went on , ` ` that also is n't what we need to talk about . '' \\n▁ again i nodded and stated , ` ` the council . '' \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' he started but i interrupted him . \\n▁ ` ` you still have n't told me about what happened and i 'd like to know . '' \\n▁ his eyes moved over my face again and he noted , ` ` you 're worried . '' \\n▁ ` ` i told you i was but that was then , only the morning after . \\n▁ now i ' ve had two days of inexplicably being under guard at your demand , something else you have n't explained . \\n▁ and , i should tell you , i kind of figured it out that i do n't have a guard to stop me from sleeping without you close . \\n▁ then there was both our families descending unexpectedly . \\n▁ not to mention lots of hot sex . \\n▁ but bottom line , time has passed . \\n▁ so before i was worried . \\n▁ now i ' m worried . '' \\n▁ his eyes warmed and his head dropped so he could rest his forehead to mine . \\n▁ what he did n't do was answer . \\n▁ therefore , i prompted , ` ` so can you either tell me everything is all right or tell me what 's wrong so i can pinpoint my freak out rather than making shit up in my head ? '' \\n▁ lucien lifted his forehead from mine and caught my eyes but i kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` because you should know , i have this thing i do . \\n▁ so i can prepare for the worst , i worry about the worst . \\n▁ then i find out what 's happening or what 's going to happen happens and it 's never the worst and i ' m relieved . \\n▁ and , seriously darling , the shit i make up is really not good so give me something to go on here . '' \\n▁ when i shut up , instantly he stated , ` ` i broke a rule . \\n▁ not an insignificant one . \\n▁ however , it is one that was created a long time ago for reasons that might have been sound then although that 's debatable . \\n▁ what is n't debatable is that they no longer are . \\n▁ it 's antiquated and confining . \\n▁ i ' ve explained my reasoning to the council and they 're considering it . \\n▁ they 'll find in my favor and all will be well . '' \\n▁ i studied his face then asked , ` ` you 're sure ? '' \\n▁ he held my eyes and i had no idea that he lied when he replied softly , ` ` i ' m sure . '' \\n▁ ` ` and , say , just for the sake of discussion , they do n't find in your favor . \\n▁ what happens to you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they 'll find in my favor . '' \\n▁ ` ` what if they do n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` leah , they 'll find in my favor . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , lucien , but what if they do n't ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they will . '' \\n▁ i pressed both hands to his chest not to push him away but to communicate my need to know and repeated , ` ` what if they do n't ? \\n▁ will they punish you ? \\n▁ vampire torture ? \\n▁ vampire prison ? \\n▁ what are we talking about here ? '' \\n▁ lucien grinned . \\n▁ ` ` there is no vampire torture or vampire prison . '' \\n▁ ` ` so what if someone does something wrong ? '' \\n▁ ` ` if their transgressions are discovered , they 're told to stop doing it and pay compensation , if the council deems it necessary . '' \\n▁ my eyes got wide . \\n▁ ` ` that 's it ? '' \\n▁ ` ` often the compensation is significant . '' \\n▁ i could n't believe this . \\n▁ ` ` so all forms of vampire punishment are paid through fines ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ if a vampire breaks a very significant rule or continues to break a rule they ' ve been penalized for before , they 'd pay with their life . '' \\n▁ i sucked in breath and my body went solid . \\n▁ lucien 's big hand framed my face . \\n▁ ` ` the rule i broke was n't that significant . '' \\n▁ ` ` holy heck , '' i breathed . \\n▁ his hand pressed gently into my head even as he gave me some of the weight of his torso . \\n▁ ` ` leah , listen to me . \\n▁ the rule i broke was not that significant . '' \\n▁ ` ` there are n't any crazy , redneck vampires on the council who pass down insanely ridiculous sentences for minor infractions are there ? '' \\n▁ i asked , lucien stared at me a second then threw his head back and burst out laughing . \\n▁ i slapped his chest and snapped , ` ` i ' m not being funny . '' \\n▁ he visibly struggled to quell his laughter and looked back at me . \\n▁ ` ` sweetheart , there are no crazy , redneck vampires at all . \\n▁ so no , there definitely are n't any on the council . '' \\n▁ that was a relief . \\n▁ ` ` so , they rule against you , they 'll make you pay a fine ? '' \\n▁ the laughter moved out of his face but he held my eyes and i did n't know he lied again when he stated , ` ` yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` and you 're a xxunk , '' i remarked . \\n▁ humor hit his features again when he murmured , ` ` i might fall short of that . '' \\n▁ ` ` a billionaire then , '' i stated and lucien did n't answer which meant yes . \\n▁ i powered through understanding this insane , totally unbelievable but still true tidbit of lucien 's life and carried on , ` ` so , essentially , it 's water off your back . '' \\n▁ something drifted through his eyes , it was n't fast and it did n't seem pleasant but i still could n't read it . \\n▁ then it was gone like it had never been there . \\n▁ then he replied , ` ` essentially , yes . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay then , '' i mumbled . \\n▁ ` ` feel better now ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked gently . \\n▁ ` ` yes but you 're a billionaire so we can probably access arms dealers . \\n▁ therefore we 're buying a flamethrower and i ' m manning it should someone on the council get a wild hair , do something stupid and they come after you . '' \\n▁ at that , a statement i made in jest -lrb- partially -rrb- , lucien 's entire face changed and i felt his body get tight . \\n▁ i also could n't read this change but i knew to my bones it was significant . \\n▁ ` ` lucien ? '' \\n▁ i called when he did n't speak . \\n▁ he blinked , his body relaxed and his hand slid into my hair on the pillow where he started to twirl a lock around his finger . \\n▁ ` ` a flamethrower is unnecessary , '' he whispered , his eyes warm , his face soft and even the air around us in our bed felt snug and safe . \\n▁ ` ` of course , '' i whispered back , sliding into his mood , the look on his face , in his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` you could probably take on the lot . '' \\n▁ ` ` without a doubt . '' \\n▁ ` ` so i have nothing to worry about . '' \\n▁ that thing drifted through his eyes again even as he murmured , ` ` no , my pet , you have nothing to worry about . '' \\n▁ i did n't like whatever was drifting through his features but , even so , i decided to trust him . \\n▁ ` ` good , '' i whispered . \\n▁ his gaze moved over my face then his head dipped and even as his fingers kept twisting my hair , his lips moved on my neck . \\n▁ lazy . \\n▁ sweet . \\n▁ nice . \\n▁ my arms circled him . \\n▁ ` ` are we done talking ? '' \\n▁ ` ` absolutely . '' \\n▁ ` ` are we going to sleep ? '' \\n▁ ` ` absolutely not . '' \\n▁ i grinned . \\n▁ then i twisted my neck , his head came up and our mouths met . \\n▁ and we absolutely did n't sleep . \\n▁ not for a long time . \\n▁ and when we did , we did it close . \\n▁ our bodies snug . \\n▁ and , for my part , i did it feeling safe . \\n▁ chapter twenty - one the attack i turned the faucet off , wrung out the washcloth , smoothed it over the edge of the basin and looked into the mirror as i grabbed a towel to dry my hands . \\n▁ lucien and i had just made love and he 'd fed . \\n▁ it was beautiful . \\n▁ as good as always . \\n▁ ecstasy . \\n▁ i 'd cleaned up and was wearing nothing but a short , ivory silk nightie . \\n▁ in the mirror , i could see the angry pink wound at my neck morphing , fading , healing . \\n▁ it did n't take long now , less than half an hour , then it would be gone . \\n▁ i watched the wound grow fainter for long moments thinking that was wild and totally freaking cool . \\n▁ i folded and returned the towel to its loop and looked back at my reflection the mirror . \\n▁ it had been a week and a half since we had the visits from our families . \\n▁ i was surprised but definitely not displeased that lucien spent that entire time with me . \\n▁ we made love . \\n▁ he fed . \\n▁ we cooked together . \\n▁ we ate together . \\n▁ we walked to the lake and swam together . \\n▁ ditto in the pool . \\n▁ we lay in bed or on the couch in the comfy seating area off the kitchen and whispered to each other or napped , doing both holding each other close . \\n▁ lucien took me out to dinner twice . \\n▁ he took me shopping once . \\n▁ i made him watch a movie with me snuggled on the couch . \\n▁ i learned about his life , his family and vampires . \\n▁ i also learned he knew most everything about me but still , he liked hearing me tell my stories anyway . \\n▁ the outside world intruded , of course . \\n▁ edwina was there , quietly taking care of the house , stocking the fridge , sometimes clucking around us like a mother hen but usually making herself scarce because she felt the mood . \\n▁ my mother called , aunt nadia too , stephanie , my sister and a couple of my cousins . \\n▁ they were worried about the nightmares i assured them -lrb- truthfully -rrb- i was no longer having . \\n▁ but i made short work of xxunk their fears so i could get back to lucien . \\n▁ he also received calls , mostly business which he would take with me close . \\n▁ sometimes they were about other things . \\n▁ those he would take elsewhere . \\n▁ i was curious and wanted to ask because i sensed they were about me . \\n▁ but i did n't because if it was bad , i did n't want to know . \\n▁ not then . \\n▁ not in that golden time i fell in love with a vampire . \\n▁ i stared at myself in the mirror , smiling . \\n▁ there it was . \\n▁ proof . \\n▁ i was demented . \\n▁ totally . \\n▁ i was in love with lucien . \\n▁ i could n't have him , not like i could one of my own , to take vows with , make children with and grow old with . \\n▁ i also could n't have him like in the time before the revolution , to take vows with , not make children with but to spend eternity together . \\n▁ and i did n't care . \\n▁ i had him now . \\n▁ i loved him now . \\n▁ and i knew it was in a way that i would love him for my forever . \\n▁ to put it simply , there were not many girls who got the chance to fall in love with a vampire . \\n▁ to have his attention , his protection , his body , his humor , his generosity , his gentleness . \\n▁ he could be bossy and annoying but that was just him and he was hot doing it so although we exchanged words because he was who he was and i was too , it never amounted to much . \\n▁ i had been right , as crazy as it sounded . \\n▁ he had all the good stuff down pat and was the best boyfriend ever . \\n▁ i did n't know how long it would last , what we had . \\n▁ and i no longer cared . \\n▁ because i had it now and i would have it for a while and even when it was gone , i 'd always have the memories we were making . \\n▁ and the moments we shared that would make the memories of years to come were so much better than anything i 'd ever experienced , anything any woman would ever experience , were enough for me . \\n▁ i knew it down to my bones . \\n▁ the mighty vampire lucien was mine … for now . \\n▁ so i was going to do whatever i had to do to make really f * * king great memories . \\n▁ but even more important , i was his . \\n▁ and , just as he promised , me giving him me meant something to him . \\n▁ not something small , something huge . \\n▁ something meaningful . \\n▁ something sweet . \\n▁ i knew that down to my bones too . \\n▁ he loved me . \\n▁ he could n't be the way he was with me and not feel what i was feeling . \\n▁ it was impossible . \\n▁ the strictures of his culture meant we could n't have forever . \\n▁ but he was just as intent as me to take what he could from the now and make it sweet . \\n▁ i knew it . \\n▁ i knew it . \\n▁ right to the heart of me . \\n▁ and he had been right . \\n▁ what he could give me when i gave him myself was beautiful . \\n▁ i looked away from the mirror still smiling and wandered into the bedroom . \\n▁ today was the end of our long , romantic interlude . \\n▁ he had an important meeting to attend that morning . \\n▁ to spend time with me , he 'd postponed it twice which , he told me , was two times too many . \\n▁ however , he assured me , once it was done , he 'd be back . \\n▁ therefore , i was a little surprised when i hit the bedroom that he was still in bed since i knew he needed to leave soon . \\n▁ but there he was . \\n▁ the covers down to his waist , chest exposed , arms lifted , his head resting on his hands and he was staring at the ceiling . \\n▁ the urge came over me and i did n't even try to suppress it . \\n▁ i had memories to make . \\n▁ so i took off running across the large room . \\n▁ i saw his head come up and i launched myself on the bed , my body landing full - length on his large one . \\n▁ he grunted , his body cocking at the h * ps but his arms locking around me as we bounced . \\n▁ ` ` jesus , leah , '' he muttered when we settled , his lips twitching . \\n▁ i planted my hands on his shoulders and smiled into his beautiful face . \\n▁ ` ` right , so , something to take with you to your meeting that we 'll celebrate when you get back with fillet mignon smothered in homemade xxunk sauce , '' i started . \\n▁ his lip twitch became a grin and my smile got bigger before i did what i needed to do to make one , huge , beautiful f * * king memory and without further ado announced , ` ` i ' m in love with you , mighty vampire lucien . '' \\n▁ his grin died instantly even as his arms spasmed around me . \\n▁ i felt my stomach clench . \\n▁ oh god . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he whispered , his deep voice sounding funny , rough , tortured . \\n▁ exactly like it did the morning after the first time he fed when he nearly killed me . \\n▁ oh god ! \\n▁ i thought he felt the same or , if not the same , then something . \\n▁ he had to . \\n▁ with how hard he worked to get it , everything we shared , he had to . \\n▁ but looking at his face i knew he did n't . \\n▁ oh god ! \\n▁ he did n't . \\n▁ i did n't expect this . \\n▁ i never dreamed he did n't feel the same as me . \\n▁ i could rejoice in the time we had , albeit short , if he returned my feelings . \\n▁ i could n't bear it if he did not . \\n▁ i did n't know what to do . \\n▁ but my body knew what to do and it prepared for escape . \\n▁ lucien felt it and in a nanosecond i was on my back with lucien on top of me . \\n▁ i knew i had no shot at getting away from him so i did the only thing i could do . \\n▁ i turned my head away and closed my eyes tight . \\n▁ god . \\n▁ god . \\n▁ my vampire did n't love me . \\n▁ ` ` sweetling , look at me , '' lucien urged softly . \\n▁ ` ` please , get off me , '' i whispered and my voice sounded funny too . \\n▁ rough . \\n▁ tortured . \\n▁ his big hand slid between my cheek and the pillow and he whispered , ` ` leah , sweetheart , please , look at me . '' \\n▁ i did n't look at him but i said quietly , ` ` i should n't have said it . \\n▁ forget i said it . '' \\n▁ ` ` look at me . '' \\n▁ ` ` it did n't happen . \\n▁ just wipe it from your mind . \\n▁ go to your meeting . \\n▁ we 'll both forget it and everything will be okay , '' i whispered desperately . \\n▁ ` ` leah , please look at me . '' \\n▁ it was then it occurred to me that his hand was cupping my face but he was n't forcing me to do what he wished . \\n▁ and it was then i opened my eyes , turned my head and looked at him . \\n▁ i should n't have done it . \\n▁ his handsome face was gentle and god , god , more beautiful than ever . \\n▁ his eyes were warm and openly troubled and that looked good on him too . \\n▁ ` ` i must attend this meeting , '' he said gently . \\n▁ ` ` it 's important or i would n't leave you . \\n▁ not now . \\n▁ not when it 's essential we talk about a variety of things . '' \\n▁ i did n't want to talk about a variety of things . \\n▁ i wanted to curl up in a ball somewhere and remind myself to stop being my … fucking … self . \\n▁ doing stupid shit . \\n▁ getting myself in trouble . \\n▁ breaking my own f * * king heart . \\n▁ ` ` leah , did you hear me ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll make this meeting short . \\n▁ i 'll get home as soon as i can and we 'll talk . '' \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i agreed knowing i 'd take the time he was gone trying to figure out how i could get out of that talk even knowing i 'd never get out of that talk . \\n▁ ` ` we should have talked before , '' he told me , his thumb sweeping the apple of my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` i knew that . \\n▁ we did n't because i was enjoying you and i did n't want that to interfere . '' \\n▁ he was enjoying me . \\n▁ god , how could i forget ? \\n▁ i was his meal . \\n▁ his f * * k buddy . \\n▁ his pet . \\n▁ god ! \\n▁ how could i forget ? \\n▁ i should have remembered . \\n▁ i should never have f * * king forgot . \\n▁ it took everything i had , everything , but i fought back the sting of tears in my eyes and the ball of fire burning in my throat . \\n▁ when i accomplished this herculean task , i whispered , ` ` go to your meeting . \\n▁ we 'll talk when you get back . '' \\n▁ ` ` back home , '' he returned immediately and i blinked . \\n▁ ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ ` ` when i get back home . '' \\n▁ i knew what he was saying and it felt like he 'd plunged a knife in my gut . \\n▁ why did he persist in this ? \\n▁ expecting me to give everything while holding himself away . \\n▁ ` ` yes , when you get back home , '' i forced out . \\n▁ his face dipped closer and i braced , every part of me . \\n▁ i knew he felt it . \\n▁ i knew he heard my heart stuttering , my breath coming uneven . \\n▁ i knew he felt my body tightening . \\n▁ i knew it because i knew he had those abilities . \\n▁ and i knew it when i saw his face get even gentler , his eyes warmer and more troubled . \\n▁ god , why would n't he just go away ? \\n▁ ` ` i told you what we had would be beautiful , '' he reminded me , twisting that knife he left in my gut , making me bleed . \\n▁ ` ` and i knew even before you said what you said earlier that you finally understood what i was giving to you . \\n▁ now , you must understand our future . '' \\n▁ he was wrong . \\n▁ i already understood it . \\n▁ i always understood it . \\n▁ i just chose to ignore it . \\n▁ stupidly , as usual . \\n▁ stupid , stupid , stupidly . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i agreed quietly . \\n▁ his eyes roamed over my face as his thumb moved over my cheek then he captured my gaze and whispered , ` ` it will still be beautiful . '' \\n▁ wrong again . \\n▁ ` ` i promise , leah , '' he continued softly . \\n▁ fucking liar . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i repeated . \\n▁ his eyes again roamed my face before coming back to mine . \\n▁ then , in perfect lucien style , he demanded , ` ` kiss your vampire before i go . '' \\n▁ his words sliced that knife up from my gut right through me , carving me open , laying me bare . \\n▁ but i did what i was told . \\n▁ wrapping my arms around his shoulders , i lifted my head the inch it needed to press my lips against his . \\n▁ his opened as did mine . \\n▁ that was when i kissed him hard , wet , long , giving him everything i had , showing him exactly how i felt , offering him everything that was me . \\n▁ and i did it because that was how i 'd been kissing him since this began , at first against my will then gleefully . \\n▁ but that was the last . \\n▁ he 'd never get that from me again . \\n▁ never . \\n▁ when he tore his mouth from mine , he immediately shoved his face in my neck . \\n▁ his arms again locked around me , his weight heavy on me and he growled , ` ` fuck , leah , '' against my skin . \\n▁ he felt it , i knew it . \\n▁ whether he understood that was the last he 'd ever get from me i did n't know . \\n▁ i also did n't care . \\n▁ i did n't care about anything . \\n▁ not anymore . \\n▁ my life yawned before me . \\n▁ years of being forced to live with a man i loved but did n't love me back and i could never really have . \\n▁ then years of bitter memories taunting me . \\n▁ i knew this . \\n▁ from the beginning i knew this . \\n▁ but did that stop me ? \\n▁ no ! \\n▁ stupid , stupid leah . \\n▁ i forced my arms to squeeze him and my lips to whisper , ` ` you need to go . '' \\n▁ he lifted his head and looked down at me . \\n▁ then he dipped it , touched his mouth to mine , pulled back slightly and murmured , ` ` i need to go . '' \\n▁ i drew in breath . \\n▁ then i was no longer in his arms . \\n▁ with vamp speed , he left the bed . \\n▁ numb , i lay still and listened to him brush his teeth , his short shower . \\n▁ before i knew it , he was wearing one of his fantastic suits , looking gorgeous standing by the bed . \\n▁ then i was mostly out of bed , my legs dangling , my feet brushing the covers , my torso held close to his with his arms tight around me . \\n▁ i looked up at him and blinked away the disorientation his speed created . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be home soon , '' he whispered . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i replied , my hands drifting to rest on his broad shoulders . \\n▁ he closed his eyes and dropped his forehead to mine . \\n▁ i used everything in my reserves to stop myself from sobbing . \\n▁ he lifted his head and opened his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , sweetling , for giving that to me . '' \\n▁ he was still whispering , his voice deeper , again rough but now with a different kind of feeling . \\n▁ in any other circumstance , i would think it was beyond beautiful . \\n▁ then , obviously , i did n't . \\n▁ because he was expressing gratitude for me giving my love and outside of a great house , fabulous clothes , beautiful shoes and unbelievable orgasms , that was the only thing he would ever give to me . \\n▁ ` ` you 're welcome , '' i replied , my voice strange , void , dead . \\n▁ he did n't miss it . \\n▁ ` ` sweetling - '' he whispered . \\n▁ ` ` you need to go , '' i reminded him . \\n▁ his arms gave me a squeeze before he ordered , ` ` busy yourself . \\n▁ do n't think of this while i ' m gone . \\n▁ when we talk , leah , i promise , you wo n't feel the way you feel right now . '' \\n▁ he was full of it . \\n▁ he 'd promised me a lot . \\n▁ and all of it was bullshit . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , you have to go , '' i told him . \\n▁ ` ` busy yourself and do n't think of this , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` okay , i 'll busy myself and not think of this , '' i lied . \\n▁ he held my eyes . \\n▁ then he whispered , ` ` you 're lying . '' \\n▁ whatever ! \\n▁ jeez ! \\n▁ why would n't he just go ? \\n▁ i held his eyes right back . \\n▁ lucien sighed . \\n▁ then he reiterated , ` ` i 'll be home soon . '' \\n▁ ` ` and i 'll be here . '' \\n▁ his arms spasmed around me again as his eyes continued to hold mine captive . \\n▁ then , if you can freaking believe , the big , fat , vampire jerk 's lips tipped up . \\n▁ his lips tipped up ! \\n▁ ` ` yes , pet , you will , '' he whispered then touched his mouth to mine . \\n▁ then he was gone . \\n▁ * * * * * it happened after i made my plans and executed them . \\n▁ i could n't get out of the talk , this i knew . \\n▁ so i would be prepared for it . \\n▁ i did not cry . \\n▁ i did not curl up and give my mind over to contemplating my bleak future . \\n▁ i did n't open up the forgotten why i hate lucien vault , catalog its multitudes and nurse my fury . \\n▁ i did n't immediately hit the kitchen and consume everything edible within reach . \\n▁ i took a shower . \\n▁ i took forever doing my hair . \\n▁ i spent a great deal of time on my makeup . \\n▁ i studied my vast wardrobe selection and picked the perfect outfit . \\n▁ and i strapped on a pair of fabulous shoes . \\n▁ i did this with only the aid of coffee supplied by edwina who took one look at me and knew things were not right . \\n▁ and fortunately she also knew that i was in no mood to discuss them . \\n▁ so she brought me coffee but otherwise let me be . \\n▁ i was coiffed . \\n▁ i was made up . \\n▁ i was wearing a freaking great pair of dark , xxunk jeans that i paired with a fabulous dusky blue , somewhat see - through top that clung to my midriff and h * ps but had a deep scoop at the back . \\n▁ i had a white xxunk tank under it . \\n▁ and my feet were in high - heeled , beige suede , wedge sandals that had a wide strap across the toe and a wide , sexy ankle strap . \\n▁ in this getup , mentally prepared for what lay ahead , i walked downstairs . \\n▁ my stomach felt hollow but i was n't hungry . \\n▁ this was unusual . \\n▁ usually , when i stupidly broke my own heart by picking the way wrong guy to give it to , i could and did eat everything in sight but only if it was n't good for me . \\n▁ now it felt like i 'd never feel hungry again . \\n▁ and the alarming thing was , now it felt like i 'd never feel anything again . \\n▁ that was how deeply lucien wounded me . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ that was n't correct . \\n▁ that was how deeply i allowed lucien to wound me . \\n▁ he fought to get in and i let him get in . \\n▁ but he knew he 'd never give himself to me . \\n▁ and i knew he never could . \\n▁ i just chose to ignore it . \\n▁ my foot hit the floor of the foyer , my mind shoving away these thoughts , forcing itself toward eating something . \\n▁ i needed to keep my strength up . \\n▁ lucien had been gone for nearly an hour . \\n▁ his office was half an hour away if you did n't drive a porsche . \\n▁ he drove a porsche and did it fast considering he could n't die unless his crash was fiery . \\n▁ so he could drive it in twenty minutes and he did . \\n▁ regularly . \\n▁ he said he 'd make the meeting short but i did n't know what that meant . \\n▁ i just knew there was a probability he could be home any minute . \\n▁ when my foot hit the floor of the foyer was when it happened . \\n▁ the front door flew straight off its hinges . \\n▁ it blew right by me through the foyer at least ten feet to crash to the floor and skid down the hall . \\n▁ every molecule in my body froze for an instant then i turned to flee up the stairs . \\n▁ my cell was on my dressing table in the wardrobe . \\n▁ i needed to call lucien . \\n▁ i got one step up and heard edwina scream . \\n▁ sheer dread coursed through my body but i had no chance to react . \\n▁ no chance to do anything . \\n▁ there was movement everywhere but nothing i could see . \\n▁ solid things dashing through the house causing blurs . \\n▁ one of them cut me off on the stairs . \\n▁ i ran into it and before i could see what it was , i fell back the step i took , landing painfully on my ass in the foyer . \\n▁ then i was up , my body like a rag doll , bent double at the waist , held tight to someone 's side , my hair blowing in the breeze created by our movement down the hall . \\n▁ as suddenly as we were moving , we stopped , my frame swaying with the rapidity of us halting . \\n▁ i was swung up and around , my body jerking unnaturally with the speed and it was sheer luck my neck or spine did n't snap . \\n▁ then i was held , my back to the front of someone , iron arms clamped around me , holding me captive , my arms held tight to my sides , rendered useless . \\n▁ but i did n't try to move . \\n▁ this was because , in the comfy seating area , i saw nestor , the vampire that had words with stephanie at my selection . \\n▁ and he was holding edwina like whoever was holding me except he had one big hand over her mouth . \\n▁ her eyes were wide and filled with fear . \\n▁ ` ` tape her to a chair in the dining room . '' \\n▁ i heard from behind me and i knew that voice . \\n▁ lucien 's father . \\n▁ etienne . \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ what was happening ? \\n▁ nestor and edwina were there one second and i felt the gust of wind they created when they sped by etienne and me . \\n▁ then they were gone . \\n▁ i heard movement in the dining room but my attention was caught on something else . \\n▁ my head jerking around i saw katrina , lucien 's ex or soon - to - be - ex mate and marcello from the night the council sent vampires to collect lucien . \\n▁ katrina was standing in my kitchen staring daggers at me . \\n▁ marcello was moving with a mortal 's speed toward etienne and me . \\n▁ my tight body got tighter but he stopped five feet away . \\n▁ then my tight body got so tight i thought it would snap in half when , his eyes burning into me with a light i did not like , he muttered heatedly , ` ` god , i want to drain her while i f * * k that fear . '' \\n▁ ` ` she is still my son 's concubine , '' etienne stated and marcello 's eyes jerked over my shoulder . \\n▁ ` ` he 's taken her as lover . \\n▁ all bets are off , '' he growled . \\n▁ ` ` we court his wrath already and you know it , '' etienne shot back . \\n▁ ` ` do n't be foolish . '' \\n▁ ` ` agreed so it should be worth my while , '' marcello returned . \\n▁ ` ` my brother , '' etienne said quietly , ` ` in the coming war , we will need your strength . \\n▁ i ask you to restrain your instincts . \\n▁ soon , all mortals will again be prey and you can take what you wish . \\n▁ my son falls or fails to protect his meal , you will have what you desire . '' \\n▁ his son falls ? \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ what was happening ? \\n▁ i breathed hard as marcello held etienne 's eyes . \\n▁ i felt no relief and kept breathing hard when he took a step back . \\n▁ ` ` now , leah , '' etienne whispered , his mouth at my ear , ` ` i ' m going to let you go and we 're going to talk . \\n▁ if you do anything unwise , i will let marcello have you . \\n▁ are you going to do anything unwise ? '' \\n▁ fuck no . \\n▁ these were vampires . \\n▁ no way i was going to do anything unwise . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` excellent , '' he murmured then let me go . \\n▁ i took two quick steps away then turned my back toward the hall and moved back two steps more . \\n▁ but it was there i stopped because i had three vampires ' eyes on me and i felt nestor come out of the dining room behind me . \\n▁ i looked amongst them , feeling my chest rise and fall , my fingers tingling , my legs quaking but i kept my shoulders straight and stood tall . \\n▁ then i moved my eyes to etienne . \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on ? '' \\n▁ i asked and was pleased beyond reason my voice did n't shake . \\n▁ ` ` we ' ve decided it 's time you knew a few things , '' etienne answered . \\n▁ i did n't want to know a few things , of this i was certain . \\n▁ i also was certain i had no choice . \\n▁ ` ` what things ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` things about our culture . \\n▁ things about your culture . \\n▁ things about my son . \\n▁ and things about this world and your place in it , '' etienne replied . \\n▁ that was a lot . \\n▁ some of which i knew or thought i did . \\n▁ though , not their versions of it . \\n▁ ` ` okay , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` now be a good girl , leah , and let your superior speak . \\n▁ i 'll tell you when and if you 're allowed to ask questions , '' etienne stated and i swallowed . \\n▁ god , seriously . \\n▁ he was such a dick . \\n▁ still , with no other choice , i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` very good , '' he leaned in , his eyes lighting , creepy , amused and terrifying , before he finished , ` ` pet . '' \\n▁ oh god . \\n▁ ` ` did you know , '' he started , ` ` that for five hundred years , it has been strictly forbidden for a vampire to take concubine as lover ? '' \\n▁ i could n't help it . \\n▁ i wanted to but i could n't . \\n▁ my midsection swayed back like he 'd struck me . \\n▁ etienne grinned . \\n▁ i opened my mouth to say no but remembered his order and instead shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` i did n't think so , '' he muttered then spoke louder when he informed me , ` ` but it 's true . \\n▁ no vampire has taken anything but blood from their concubine for centuries . \\n▁ centuries . \\n▁ but my son had your contract altered . \\n▁ he did this without the knowledge or the assent of the dominion . \\n▁ they ' ve since found out and they are not happy . '' \\n▁ the rule he broke . \\n▁ the not insignificant rule he broke . \\n▁ and he broke it to have me . \\n▁ please tell me this was n't happening . \\n▁ i stayed silent . \\n▁ etienne kept speaking . \\n▁ ` ` vampires do not live with their concubines . \\n▁ they do n't kiss them at feasts . \\n▁ and seeing as he 's obviously f * * king you , he 's done whatever the f * * k he wished to do prior to receiving permission from the council . \\n▁ they will not take to this kindly . '' \\n▁ i pressed my lips together and nodded so he knew i heard him . \\n▁ he went on . \\n▁ ` ` whether willfully or coincidentally , this has made other vampires question this law . \\n▁ we , '' he flung his arm out to indicate marcello , katrina and nestor , ` ` welcome this . \\n▁ because this means war . \\n▁ and we are ready . '' \\n▁ okay . \\n▁ right . \\n▁ this was n't just not good . \\n▁ this was not good ! \\n▁ ` ` it has been a long time coming , '' etienne whispered . \\n▁ ` ` vampires hunt . \\n▁ vampires feed . \\n▁ immortals should rule this planet not be ruled by rules . '' \\n▁ i fought it but i could n't stop myself from trembling . \\n▁ etienne was far from done . \\n▁ ` ` we do not wish to take your kind as mates . '' \\n▁ he spat out the last word and if i did n't already have a fair inkling about how he felt about ` ` my kind '' i knew by the way he spat that word . \\n▁ ` ` we simply wish to take your kind whatever way we like , whenever we like . \\n▁ and this is how it will be . '' \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ not good . \\n▁ i pressed my lips together . \\n▁ etienne kept going . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , either xxunk or unwittingly , began that process . \\n▁ everyone within our culture is positioning . \\n▁ vampires who do not wish change and are willing to fight for status quo . \\n▁ concubines who desire to keep their place as the parasites of our culture . \\n▁ vampires who wish to be free to find their mates whatever form they take . \\n▁ and my brethren , '' again with the sweep of his arm , ` ` wishing simply to be free to be vampires . '' \\n▁ well , one thing i could say about that . \\n▁ that was pure lucien , doing what he wanted to do and damn the consequences . \\n▁ when he stopped and did n't start again , even though i did n't want him to continue , i nodded anyway . \\n▁ so he continued . \\n▁ ` ` do not fool yourself into thinking my son cares about you . \\n▁ he wants you to believe this , of course , it is the way with a taming . \\n▁ but it is not real . '' \\n▁ another body sway when the impact of his words slammed into me and he smiled . \\n▁ he was loving every second of this . \\n▁ the bastard . \\n▁ he went on but this time he did it quietly , slowly , savoring the pain he knew he was going to cause . \\n▁ ` ` he had his mortal mate . \\n▁ the delectable maggie . '' \\n▁ god . \\n▁ god ! \\n▁ god ! \\n▁ ` ` maggie was captured , tortured and killed during the revolution . '' \\n▁ oh no . \\n▁ oh god . \\n▁ god . \\n▁ god ! \\n▁ god ! \\n▁ ` ` maggie was my son 's one and only true love , as sickening as that may be , it is the truth . \\n▁ maggie 's death was the reason lucien was unstoppable during that conflict . \\n▁ maggie 's death was the reason he was unstoppable in hunting his own who would plot to resurrect the conflict . \\n▁ maggie was everything to him . \\n▁ maggie was his reason for being . \\n▁ without maggie , he exists . \\n▁ he does it well , he enjoys his life and the fruits of his endeavors , but it is simply existence . \\n▁ nothing more . \\n▁ you , delicious leah , he is using . \\n▁ our lives are long , we must have our challenges and even if you 're simply breathing , you must find diversions to break up the monotony . \\n▁ that is what you are , leah . \\n▁ a diversion . \\n▁ an enjoyable one , a succulent one , but simply a diversion . '' \\n▁ love is a blanket that keeps you warm . \\n▁ lucien knew that to be true because of maggie . \\n▁ we 'd talked a lot . \\n▁ he 'd spent time educating me . \\n▁ he 'd told me stories of his family . \\n▁ but he 'd never mentioned maggie . \\n▁ i fought the tears that filled my eyes . \\n▁ i did n't succeed . \\n▁ and i hated it when etienne grinned a triumphant , creepy grin when he saw them slide down my cheeks . \\n▁ ` ` i will educate you about our taming , '' he said with false gentleness . \\n▁ ` ` we have been forbidden to do this as well but we all yearn for it . \\n▁ we all enjoy it . \\n▁ but once a taming is complete , we will take pleasure in the spoils of our victory and then we will retreat . \\n▁ move onto the next taming , the next meal , the next diversion that makes a vampire 's life sweet . '' \\n▁ every word , every single word he said was killing me . \\n▁ lucien had lied . \\n▁ he 'd not only broken promises , he 'd flat out lied . \\n▁ from the beginning . \\n▁ the very beginning . \\n▁ he 'd played with me like a toy . \\n▁ like his pet . \\n▁ he 'd played with me . \\n▁ the tears kept coming . \\n▁ ` ` you are nothing , leah , '' he whispered , his eyes boring into me . \\n▁ ` ` a plaything now and always a parasite . \\n▁ but in the end , in the course of a vampire 's life , a few years spent enjoying a morsel , we release you and in no time at all , we do n't remember how you taste , what you look like , even your name . '' \\n▁ more tears . \\n▁ that was all i had to give to what he was saying to me so that was all he got . \\n▁ but he loved each salty drop . \\n▁ ` ` and now you understand your place , do you have any questions ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` is edwina all right ? '' \\n▁ i asked in return and his eyes shifted behind me . \\n▁ nestor must have made some nonverbal reply because they shifted back and he nodded . \\n▁ i nodded back . \\n▁ ` ` that 's all you wish to know ? '' \\n▁ he prompted when i said no more . \\n▁ ` ` i think you ' ve been thorough , '' i whispered and heard nestor 's chuckle from behind my back but i did n't turn . \\n▁ i kept my eyes on etienne . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m pleased you think so , '' etienne muttered , grinning his sadistic grin at me . \\n▁ ` ` now , we will be leaving . '' \\n▁ i blinked . \\n▁ was he high ? \\n▁ break into the mighty lucien 's house and then just leave ? \\n▁ one could say i was thrilled beyond belief they were going but lucien was going to lose his mind ! \\n▁ he must have read my face for he carried on . \\n▁ ` ` you can tell him what you wish . \\n▁ we 're prepared for his response . '' \\n▁ oh shit . \\n▁ that did n't sound good either . \\n▁ ` ` yes , leah , we are prepared . \\n▁ you can tell my son that too , '' etienne whispered menacingly . \\n▁ i swallowed again . \\n▁ he kept going . \\n▁ ` ` and tell your aunts , your cousin , your friends to enjoy their lives as they are to their fullest . \\n▁ the days when a concubine could provide us nourishment for a spell then suck from us for the rest of their days are numbered . \\n▁ do you understand me ? '' \\n▁ oh yes . \\n▁ i understood him . \\n▁ totally . \\n▁ he did n't like mortals . \\n▁ but he really did n't like concubines . \\n▁ boy , i understood him all right . \\n▁ i nodded . \\n▁ ` ` good girl , '' he murmured patronizingly and bile slid up my throat . \\n▁ he studied me . \\n▁ i stood still and let him , just happy that i 'd quit crying . \\n▁ ` ` you know , '' he whispered thoughtfully , ` ` it 's almost sad , you mortals handing your hearts to vampires . \\n▁ it has been a long time since i ' ve seen that look on a mortal 's face after she learned of a vampire 's true nature . '' \\n▁ he cocked his head to the side , his lips twitched and he finished , ` ` thank you , delicious leah , for giving that back to me . '' \\n▁ and i knew it then . \\n▁ he 'd played with many women , scores of them , maybe hundreds of them . \\n▁ all of them just like his son had played me . \\n▁ god , i hated him . \\n▁ hated him . \\n▁ more than i hated his son and that was saying something . \\n▁ he jerked up his chin , my body swayed and my hair flew back when they all sped by me . \\n▁ i stood solid and staring at nothing then it hit me . \\n▁ edwina . \\n▁ i turned on my foot and ran to the dining room . \\n▁ i halted on a skid in the door when i saw her duct taped to a chair , more tape on her mouth , tears sliding down her cheeks , terror stamped on her features . \\n▁ i shook myself out of my horror and dashed to her . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry , i ' m sorry , edwina , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` in the movies they do this fast . \\n▁ i ' m going to do it fast . \\n▁ get it over with . \\n▁ please , forgive me . '' \\n▁ then i tore the tape off her mouth . \\n▁ she cried out in pain and the sound cut through me . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll get these off , '' i muttered , shaking the piece of tape away from my fingers and going to work on the tape at her wrists . \\n▁ ` ` are you okay ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i ' m … no , '' she answered shakily . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ of course not . \\n▁ she would n't be . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll just … i 'll … '' i stopped talking and my hands stopped moving . \\n▁ you are nothing , leah … a plaything … we do n't remember how you taste , what you look like , even your name . \\n▁ my eyes moved to edwina 's wet ones . \\n▁ she read mine immediately . \\n▁ ` ` leah , i heard him . \\n▁ every word , '' she whispered . \\n▁ do not fool yourself into thinking my son cares about you . \\n▁ he wants you to believe this , of course , it is the way with a taming . \\n▁ but it is not real . \\n▁ ` ` leah , listen to me . \\n▁ do n't believe what he says , '' edwina urged , her voice insistent . \\n▁ that is what you are , leah . \\n▁ a diversion . \\n▁ an enjoyable one , a succulent one , but simply a diversion . \\n▁ ` ` those vampires with him , they are few , '' edwina kept whispering urgently . \\n▁ ` ` everyone knows of etienne , no one respects him . \\n▁ katrina was only here because she 's angry . \\n▁ a week , a month , she 'll rethink and she 'll retreat . \\n▁ nestor , marcello , they have been enemies to lucien for years . \\n▁ jealous of his fame , his abilities , his fortune . \\n▁ they have allied with etienne for no other reasons then to make lucien suffer . \\n▁ do n't believe what he says , leah . \\n▁ not a word of it . '' \\n▁ i did n't hear anything she said . \\n▁ i heard lucien telling me , it will still be beautiful . \\n▁ i told him he had my love and he did n't return it . \\n▁ still , he thought he could talk me into continuing to service him by convincing me the emptiness he could give me was f * * king beautiful . \\n▁ he had the love of his life . \\n▁ it sucked she was tortured and killed but at least he had her . \\n▁ i did n't have anything . \\n▁ nothing . \\n▁ everything had been taken from me . \\n▁ everything i had , everything i owned , everything i was . \\n▁ taken by lucien . \\n▁ i focused on edwina 's face . \\n▁ ` ` please , someday , understand what i ' m going to do now and forgive me , '' i whispered . \\n▁ then i straightened away from her and ran out of the dining room on my high - heeled , kickass wedges . \\n▁ ` ` no ! '' \\n▁ she cried . \\n▁ ` ` leah ! \\n▁ no ! \\n▁ do n't listen to him . \\n▁ unbind me ! \\n▁ we must call lucien immediately ! '' \\n▁ i ran to the phones first . \\n▁ each one i grabbed and ripped free from the wall . \\n▁ each one i ran to the pool and threw it in . \\n▁ then i ran to the key hooks by the backdoor , grabbed edwina 's keys , went to her purse , snatched out her cell and i took those to the pool too and threw them in . \\n▁ i did n't have much time . \\n▁ i had to hurry . \\n▁ i ran upstairs and found the two suitcases i brought with me stored in the hall closet . \\n▁ i dragged them to the wardrobe . \\n▁ quickly but carefully i packed . \\n▁ not the things lucien bought for me -lrb- except my undies and nighties since i 'd thrown all my old ones away seeing as the ones lucien gave me were much nicer -rrb- . \\n▁ makeup . \\n▁ shampoo . \\n▁ lotion . \\n▁ jewelry . \\n▁ everything that was mine that i could see . \\n▁ i shoved my phone in my bag , ran to the desk in the bedroom and grabbed my passport . \\n▁ then i dragged the bags down the stairs and did n't look into the dining room as i rolled them right past . \\n▁ ` ` leah ! \\n▁ do n't ! \\n▁ please call lucien ! \\n▁ do n't leave ! \\n▁ if nothing else , it is n't safe ! '' \\n▁ edwina called after me . \\n▁ i felt like a bitch . \\n▁ worse than a bitch , leaving her tied there . \\n▁ that was mean . \\n▁ it was selfish . \\n▁ it was ugly . \\n▁ but i had no choice . \\n▁ i had to get away . \\n▁ i had to escape . \\n▁ and lucien could be home any minute . \\n▁ edwina was a nice lady so i hoped to god one day she 'd forgive me . \\n▁ i went out to the cayenne and loaded up my bags . \\n▁ i got in and hit the garage door opener . \\n▁ i buckled my seatbelt and noticed belatedly my hands were trembling . \\n▁ this was n't the only thing trembling . \\n▁ my whole body was . \\n▁ as were the tears in my eyes . \\n▁ i forced my thoughts on what was next . \\n▁ bank , drain the accounts where lucien deposited my concubine plaything money . \\n▁ find an atm and take a maximum withdrawal from my account at home . \\n▁ get out of dragon lake . \\n▁ stop at the nearest used car dealership , ditch the cayenne and get another car . \\n▁ i made my plans then i executed them . \\n▁ bank . \\n▁ thank god , no line . \\n▁ atm at the same place . \\n▁ easy . \\n▁ and as i drove out of dragon lake , i grabbed my cell and dialed 911 . \\n▁ ` ` nine - one - one , what 's your emergency ? '' \\n▁ they answered . \\n▁ ` ` there 's been a break in … '' i told them the address where to find edwina . \\n▁ then i whispered , ` ` hurry . '' \\n▁ i disconnected the call , hit the button to roll down my window and threw my cell phone out . \\n▁ i did n't know how it worked but on tv they could track you with phones . \\n▁ not mine . \\n▁ not anymore . \\n▁ lucien would hunt me and he was within his rights to kill me . \\n▁ i knew i 'd see him again . \\n▁ i knew when i did he 'd be infuriated . \\n▁ i knew it would be done , one way or another . \\n▁ done . \\n▁ over . \\n▁ and i would be free . \\n▁ chapter twenty - two the secret lucien drove into the car park under his office building . \\n▁ he was furious . \\n▁ the drive to his office took well over an hour . \\n▁ a four car pileup causing a massive backup with subsequent delays . \\n▁ more times than he could count , he stopped himself from turning around and going back . \\n▁ back home . \\n▁ back to leah . \\n▁ back to explain things to her , smooth that hideous look out of her features , the pain out of her eyes , inject the life back into her voice . \\n▁ but he could n't . \\n▁ this was gregor . \\n▁ gregor was a member of the council and with gregor 's alliance he could assist with making leah safe . \\n▁ twice , he 'd postponed a set meeting and he 'd done it to spend time with leah . \\n▁ he could n't delay again . \\n▁ gregor was impatient , the meeting important , even imperative , he 'd told lucien through avery . \\n▁ he had to take the f * * king meeting . \\n▁ he guided the porsche to its spot thinking she loved him . \\n▁ his leah loved him . \\n▁ he knew it . \\n▁ he knew it was happening . \\n▁ not only because stephanie warned him , kate told him but because he felt it . \\n▁ and that was why he 'd done what he 'd done . \\n▁ selfish in the extreme but it was too beautiful , leah 's love . \\n▁ better than her beauty . \\n▁ better than her smell . \\n▁ even better than her blood . \\n▁ it was like a drug . \\n▁ the feeling of ecstasy . \\n▁ constant , from waking until sleep and even in his dreams , having her close . \\n▁ fuck . \\n▁ fuck ! \\n▁ he should have talked to her as kate asked . \\n▁ as a priority . \\n▁ he should have talked to her . \\n▁ he parked , shut the porsche down and exited the car without delay . \\n▁ he needed to get this meeting done . \\n▁ he needed to get back home . \\n▁ back to leah . \\n▁ i ' m in love with you , mighty vampire lucien . \\n▁ the words pierced his brain as he closed the door to the car and he lost control . \\n▁ the door slammed to and the entire car shuddered and shifted four feet into the next , luckily vacant , spot . \\n▁ he stared at his vehicle as it continued to rock then as it stopped . \\n▁ he closed his eyes , leaned into his forearms on the roof of the car and dropped his head . \\n▁ sweetling , look at me . \\n▁ please , get off me . \\n▁ husky . \\n▁ agonized . \\n▁ leah , sweetheart , please , look at me . \\n▁ i should n't have said it . \\n▁ forget i said it . \\n▁ look at me . \\n▁ it did n't happen . \\n▁ just wipe it from your mind . \\n▁ go to your meeting . \\n▁ we 'll both forget it and everything will be okay . \\n▁ whispered . \\n▁ desperate . \\n▁ agonized . \\n▁ desperate . \\n▁ he 'd done that . \\n▁ he 'd made her feel those things . \\n▁ being selfish . \\n▁ taking and forgetting he could n't give . \\n▁ taking and forgetting his duty was to keep her safe . \\n▁ taking what he could n't stop himself from taking and forgetting to protect her , causing her agony , just like at her bloodletting . \\n▁ he 'd never forget she 'd said it . \\n▁ he 'd never be able to wipe it from his mind . \\n▁ it was burned there , literally for eternity . \\n▁ ` ` fuck , '' he whispered . \\n▁ his eyes opened , he lifted his head and looked blindly through the car park . \\n▁ then he thought of gregor . \\n▁ not the impending meeting . \\n▁ gregor 's decision five hundred years ago . \\n▁ lucien had three choices . \\n▁ keep taking from leah . \\n▁ make her his mate and put her in even more danger , conceivably making their nightmares come real . \\n▁ or , for her sake , release her . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ he had only one choice . \\n▁ the last . \\n▁ fuck . \\n▁ he sucked in breath , straightened from the car and eschewed the elevator in order to race up the forty flights of stairs with vampire speed . \\n▁ if a mortal saw him and it came to the attention of the council , f * * k it . \\n▁ let them fine him . \\n▁ in mere hours he was losing everything . \\n▁ everything . \\n▁ he slowed when he hit the hall and stayed slowed as he opened the door and moved through his busy offices . \\n▁ he took out his cell and turned it off in preparation for the meeting while employees nodded to him , lifted their chins , lucien returning the gestures . \\n▁ he saw sally behind her desk through the glass wall that exposed her office . \\n▁ she 'd been in his employ for ten years . \\n▁ in that time she 'd met and married her husband , had two children and lost her mother . \\n▁ in that time , he had n't aged a day . \\n▁ it was time to move on . \\n▁ create new companies , sell his vast holdings to himself , distribute severance packages , references , let his workforce go and move . \\n▁ this time , he 'd need to disappear , hire someone young and competent to act in his stead for twenty , thirty years . \\n▁ then he 'd need to go through the motions again , managing his holdings as a ghost . \\n▁ in sixty , seventy years , he 'd resurface or perhaps continue as a phantom looking after his fortune . \\n▁ he 'd been considering it a while . \\n▁ he 'd even planned to discuss the destination for their future home with leah . \\n▁ now he decided singapore . \\n▁ magdalene had moved there three years ago . \\n▁ she loved it . \\n▁ and he 'd never lived there . \\n▁ it was as good a place as any . \\n▁ in order to protect the knowledge he was vampire , he 'd done this times too numerous to count . \\n▁ it was a chore that was never less than trying . \\n▁ and every time he wished he could simply be who he f * * king was and not be forced to engage in this aggravation . \\n▁ he pushed through the glass doors to sally 's outer office . \\n▁ sally looked up and smiled . \\n▁ then she read his face and the smile died . \\n▁ therefore , instantly , she reported , ` ` i ' ve given them coffee and bagels , told them you called and explained your delay . '' \\n▁ ` ` thank you , sally , '' he muttered , moving to the glossy , wood panel double doors that led to his office . \\n▁ ` ` would you like fresh coffee ? '' \\n▁ she called to his back . \\n▁ he 'd had nothing but leah 's blood and he 'd had her blood not knowing it was the last taste of her he 'd ever have . \\n▁ he always savored her . \\n▁ if he 'd known , he would have taken the time to savor more . \\n▁ not just her blood , all that was her when she gave it to him . \\n▁ ` ` no coffee and no interruptions , '' lucien answered , turning the knob and pushing open the door . \\n▁ he took in the room before he closed the door behind him . \\n▁ cosmo leaning against the side of his desk , arms crossed , ankles crossed . \\n▁ stephanie lounging in an armchair in the seating area at the side of the room , legs crossed , coffee cup in hand . \\n▁ avery and gregor both seated on the couch , avery 's posture relaxed but alert . \\n▁ gregor , however , was lounged back like stephanie , legs crossed , looking bored . \\n▁ lucien walked to the seating area as cosmo pushed away from his desk and approached from the other side . \\n▁ ` ` i apologize for the delay . \\n▁ traffic , '' lucien muttered , stopping at the back of the vacant armchair across from stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` these things happen , '' gregor murmured , studying lucien . \\n▁ lucien crossed his arms on his chest and leveled his eyes on gregor , ignoring the others . \\n▁ rude , he knew , but he did n't give a f * * k . \\n▁ he needed to get this done and he needed to go home and release leah so she could begin healing from the wounds he 'd willfully inflicted , enjoying every f * * king second of it . \\n▁ ` ` unfortunately i must apologize again . \\n▁ i know my xxunk have been frustrating and today 's delay the same but the reasons for this meeting are now moot . \\n▁ this afternoon , i 'll be releasing leah from her contract . '' \\n▁ he heard the swift hiss of stephanie 's indrawn breath at the same time he heard cosmo 's whispered , ` ` what the f * * k ? '' \\n▁ both of these came with avery growing more alert and gregor 's gaze turning sharp . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry ? '' \\n▁ gregor asked softly . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m releasing leah , '' lucien answered . \\n▁ ` ` fucking hell , lucien ! '' \\n▁ stephanie snapped as she shot out of her chair . \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on ? '' \\n▁ lucien looked to stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` it 's none of your concern . '' \\n▁ her eyes got big . \\n▁ ` ` none of my concern ? \\n▁ are you mad ? '' \\n▁ lucien took in a long , slow breath and held her eyes but he did not speak . \\n▁ stephanie did n't like that , leaned forward and demanded , ` ` answer me ! \\n▁ are you mad ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i 'll repeat , xxunk , it 's none of your concern . '' \\n▁ ` ` you are mad , '' she whispered , her eyes narrowing . \\n▁ ` ` lucien even you can not expect to tip our culture on its head after five hundred years of convention then , weeks later , change your mind on a whim , '' cosmo put in , his voice low with anger . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes moved to cosmo as he spoke and when he was done , he stated , ` ` it 's not a whim . '' \\n▁ ` ` what is it then ? '' \\n▁ cosmo retorted . \\n▁ ` ` what it is , is none of your f * * king concern , '' lucien shot back . \\n▁ ` ` this is unbelievable , '' stephanie hissed and lucien looked to her . \\n▁ ` ` xxunk , calm , '' avery murmured . \\n▁ stephanie 's head was a blur when she turned to avery and shouted , ` ` i will not be calm ! \\n▁ we 're on the cuff of war ! '' \\n▁ ` ` you 're in love with her . '' \\n▁ the room went still when gregor spoke these word and lucien 's eyes moved to him . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he confirmed without hesitation . \\n▁ ` ` oh my god , '' stephanie whispered . \\n▁ ` ` jesus f * * king christ , '' cosmo said softly . \\n▁ ` ` you know my choices gregor , '' lucien stated calmly . \\n▁ ` ` you 're the only one in this room who does . \\n▁ i can keep her safe but for how long ? \\n▁ the feeding i ' ve done from her , it wo n't have had the chance to have much effect , give her a longer life . \\n▁ she has forty , fifty years left of mortal life . \\n▁ that 's better than living whatever length of time i can keep her alive , doing it on the run and her life ending on a scaffold while she watches me burn . \\n▁ you know that better than anyone in this room . \\n▁ therefore , this afternoon , i ' m releasing her . '' \\n▁ ` ` how long have you known ? '' \\n▁ stephanie asked quietly and lucien 's gaze went to her . \\n▁ ` ` the minute i saw her twenty years ago , '' lucien answered . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you say anything ? '' \\n▁ her voice was rising . \\n▁ ` ` because i only admitted it to myself two minutes ago , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ stephanie closed her eyes and dropped her head . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ cosmo asked and lucien looked to him . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` yes , lucien , why ? \\n▁ if you love her , why are you releasing her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` you ' ve never mated . \\n▁ seven hundred and fifty - three years , cosmo , you ' ve been on this earth and not one woman , mortal or immortal , have you stood beside and exchanged blood and vows . \\n▁ when you do , you 'll know why , '' lucien returned . \\n▁ ` ` none of this was about the taming , '' cosmo accused . \\n▁ ` ` it 's bullshit that you only knew two minutes ago you loved her . \\n▁ you ' ve known it all along . '' \\n▁ lucien inclined his head . \\n▁ ` ` on some level , yes . \\n▁ but i was denying it for leah 's safety . \\n▁ and bullshit it might have been cosmo , but you knew too . \\n▁ so did stephanie . \\n▁ and isobel . \\n▁ and anyone who really knows me . \\n▁ if you 're honest , all of you knew i was doing this for more reasons than to tame and f * * k a concubine . '' \\n▁ ` ` so on some level you knew you could n't have her and she could n't have you and you did it anyway , '' cosmo reminded him . \\n▁ ` ` what i knew from what i had with maggie was that having leah for even a little while was better than not having her at all . \\n▁ not only for me but for her . \\n▁ and our time together proved me right . \\n▁ and i knew , this time , our time together would be short . \\n▁ so i knew i could n't waste any . \\n▁ what i did not factor was that leah would return my feelings so swiftly . '' \\n▁ at this , understanding dawned . \\n▁ lucien knew it when cosmo flinched and turned his head away . \\n▁ lucien looked to gregor . \\n▁ ` ` she shared she was in love with me today . \\n▁ as the council is considering my request , i ' ve reflected on this . \\n▁ my first instinct was to talk logic to her in an effort to prolong our arrangement . \\n▁ but this is leah . \\n▁ i know her better than that . \\n▁ she consumes life , she 's ruled by emotion . \\n▁ she wo n't enjoy what we have for a short time . \\n▁ and she can not know i reciprocate her feelings . \\n▁ if she does , she 'll never let me go . \\n▁ and i 'll not want her to . \\n▁ thinking i do n't share her love , she 's already shut down on me . \\n▁ she 's retreating in an effort to control the pain i ' ve caused . \\n▁ i must release her for her sake . \\n▁ therefore , i do not need the council 's permission . \\n▁ that said , if other vampires wish to indulge in a taming , you should know i will champion them . '' \\n▁ ` ` please sit , lucien , '' gregor requested quietly . \\n▁ lucien shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` i must get back to leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` please , lucien . \\n▁ sit , '' gregor said more firmly . \\n▁ ` ` this is done . \\n▁ i must get back home . '' \\n▁ home . \\n▁ home . \\n▁ not anymore . \\n▁ fuck . \\n▁ fuck ! \\n▁ gregor held his eyes . \\n▁ then he stated , ` ` what i ' m about to say is known by very few . \\n▁ a very select few . \\n▁ if anyone outside of that sacred circle and the occupants of this room ever speak of what i ' m going to tell you , it wo n't matter which one of you shared the secret . \\n▁ all of you will be hunted . \\n▁ all of you will be captured . \\n▁ all of you will be tortured until you beg to be burned . \\n▁ every member of your family will have the same fate . \\n▁ and everyone you love , immortal or , '' his eyes sharpened on lucien 's face , ` ` mortal will share that fate too . '' \\n▁ ` ` holy shit , '' stephanie breathed , sitting back down . \\n▁ ` ` speak , '' lucien barked and gregor lifted his chin . \\n▁ then his gaze swept the room as he announced , ` ` immortal history is a lie . '' \\n▁ lucien felt his eyes narrow . \\n▁ ` ` i beg your pardon ? '' \\n▁ cosmo asked . \\n▁ ` ` immortal history is a lie , '' gregor repeated . \\n▁ ` ` millennia ago , a decision was made . \\n▁ there was much fighting . \\n▁ bloody battle after bloody battle was waged . \\n▁ immortals tortured , beheaded , burned . \\n▁ it was gruesome , it was destructive and in the end it simply decimated the number of our species . \\n▁ tragically . \\n▁ there were very few of us left . \\n▁ any of us . '' \\n▁ he lifted a hand to gesture to avery . \\n▁ ` ` vampires . \\n▁ werewolves . \\n▁ wraiths . \\n▁ phantoms . \\n▁ xxunk . \\n▁ the wee . \\n▁ so the remainder of the species came to an agreement and made their decision . \\n▁ many of our people need humans to survive . \\n▁ a way needed to be found that we could live amongst them peacefully . \\n▁ the battles were mostly fought over conflicts about domination . \\n▁ being vastly stronger and extremely difficult to kill , there were immortals who felt our kind should rule mortals and when i say that i mean enslave them . \\n▁ the others were bent on a more democratic co - existence even if they knew it would mean hiding who we are . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is not news , gregor . \\n▁ these ancient battles are known amongst all immortals . \\n▁ to this day it is a very ill - kept secret that there are those who still harbor these different political opinions , '' lucien informed him . \\n▁ ` ` yes , you do know of that , of course , '' gregor stated , looking up at lucien . \\n▁ ` ` what you do n't know is that the different species are not mutated from homo sapiens , a transmutation of wolf and human , an evolutionary process based on geography or a metamorphosis of natural forces into human forms nor did we evolve to what we are today from primordial slime . \\n▁ we were made from magic . '' \\n▁ ` ` holy shit , '' stephanie breathed . \\n▁ ` ` that 's ridiculous , '' cosmo bit out . \\n▁ gregor looked to cosmo . \\n▁ ` ` it may seem so but it 's absolutely true . \\n▁ we are otherworldly . \\n▁ we are supernatural . \\n▁ there is no explanation for us . \\n▁ we are magic . '' \\n▁ ` ` explain , '' lucien growled and gregor 's eyes came to him . \\n▁ ` ` i can not , lucien . \\n▁ as i said , there is no explanation for us . \\n▁ there has been much research on the topic but whenever and however we came into existence , in those ancient times there were no records kept . \\n▁ and there were so many of our species killed in these battles and the secret has been kept for so long , even the ancients who made the pact have since expired . \\n▁ if they knew the secret of our origin , they took it to their deaths . '' \\n▁ ` ` this ca n't be possible , '' stephanie whispered . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't , '' gregor informed her . \\n▁ ` ` that 's what makes it magic . '' \\n▁ ` ` if that 's the case , explain how we share the same exact body structure as humans . \\n▁ we mate the same . \\n▁ reproduce the same . \\n▁ breathe , sleep and , for the most part , eat the same , '' lucien demanded . \\n▁ ` ` i do not know the answer to that either . \\n▁ but think about it , lucien , '' gregor encouraged softly . \\n▁ ` ` each species does , indeed , share the same exact body structure as humans and yet , unless we are beheaded or burned , we do not die . \\n▁ on this earth , nearly everything dies eventually . \\n▁ even the ancients who made that pact did n't die naturally . \\n▁ some were killed and others killed themselves . '' \\n▁ ` ` we consume mortal blood to nourish us , keep us alive , '' stephanie put in . \\n▁ ` ` we 'd die without it . '' \\n▁ ` ` you 'd be weakened significantly . \\n▁ but you would not die . \\n▁ this is not a fact understood by our kind because none of us have tested this theory by abstaining . \\n▁ but it is nevertheless true , '' gregor stated , stephanie 's eyes got wide and gregor carried on . \\n▁ ` ` but wraiths and phantoms consume mortal energy . \\n▁ how is that possible ? \\n▁ it seems natural to us since we ' ve known it for what seems like eternity but , stephanie , it … is … not . \\n▁ if you think about it logically , you know it too . \\n▁ not to mention , werewolves are immortal and they do n't consume anything mortal or anything different than mortals do . \\n▁ except to say they consume a lot of it and xxunk it much faster . '' \\n▁ ` ` why would immortals be told we 're humans ? '' \\n▁ stephanie asked . \\n▁ ` ` lying to us about who we are does n't make sense . '' \\n▁ ` ` we already are different from humans and unfortunately that species is prone to fearing the unknown and we all know that fear often manifests unpleasantly . \\n▁ to convince immortals that they share integral parts with humans gave immortals a sense of humanity . \\n▁ a oneness with the other beings inhabiting this earth . \\n▁ doing it built in immortals an affinity between the species . \\n▁ if you feel you ' ve evolved from a species that is inferior to you but you have the capacity to feel compassion , it would assist in eradicating urges to subjugate your inferiors because they are an extension of yourselves . \\n▁ and , for millennia , you must admit , this has worked very well . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is bloody insane , '' cosmo muttered . \\n▁ ` ` indeed but it 's also absolutely true , '' gregor returned . \\n▁ ` ` and this great secret , '' lucien stated and gregor 's attention returned to him , ` ` you 're sharing this with us now because … ? '' \\n▁ ` ` because of the prophesies , '' gregor answered . \\n▁ ` ` oh shit . \\n▁ here we go , '' stephanie murmured and gregor turned to her , his eyebrows snapping together . \\n▁ ` ` you know of the prophesies ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she retorted . \\n▁ ` ` but two minutes ago i learned i ' m supernatural . \\n▁ it would stand to reason right on the heels of that you 'd spout nonsense about prophesies . \\n▁ fuck , gregor , i ' m hundreds of years old . \\n▁ i ' ve read my fair share of books . \\n▁ with supernatural shit , there 's always f * * king prophesies . '' \\n▁ stephanie was pissed but she was also amusing . \\n▁ even so , lucien did not laugh . \\n▁ gregor responded , ` ` well the ones you 'll learn of today all have to do with the three . \\n▁ the three being the sacred triumvirate which includes a vampire whose strength and cunning know no equal but who also has added abilities beyond any shared by his species . \\n▁ he will find his lifemate , a mortal woman of great spirit who also has her own abilities . \\n▁ those she was born with , one of which is the ability to absorb her mate 's powers through his feeding . '' \\n▁ the air in the room went thick and lucien 's gut wrenched as his chest squeezed . \\n▁ gregor was n't finished . \\n▁ ` ` the second is the king of werewolves who will find his lifemate and , she too , will have otherworldly powers . \\n▁ and the last is a werewolf , vampire hybrid whose mortal lifemate will also be exceptional . '' \\n▁ ` ` werewolves and vampires can not produce children , '' cosmo declared . \\n▁ ` ` yes , and neither can vampires and mortals but if the prophesies come true , lucien will sire four children on leah in the next ten years , '' gregor returned . \\n▁ lucien could n't have held back his reaction if he tried . \\n▁ but he did n't try . \\n▁ his hand shot out , his fingers curling tightly around the top of the chair in front of him . \\n▁ ` ` my god , '' stephanie whispered . \\n▁ gregor looked to lucien . \\n▁ ` ` times are changing , '' he stated softly . \\n▁ ` ` war is nearly upon us . \\n▁ and this is not a war amongst vampires who wish to be freed from the xxunk of the immortal and mortal agreement against those who do not . \\n▁ it will be war amongst all immortals allied with mortals who will fight against the immortals who wish to rid the planet of their brethren who think differently than they do . \\n▁ brethren who want to live amongst what their enemies consider their inferiors . \\n▁ and our enemy wishes to enslave their inferiors to serve them in all ways . \\n▁ and , i ' m sorry to say , lucien , as you have endured much in your years , you and your leah are part of the three . \\n▁ a trio of lifemates who will be instrumental in stopping this or the six of you will perish trying . '' \\n▁ fuck . \\n▁ fuck ! \\n▁ ` ` what does this mean ? '' \\n▁ cosmo asked . \\n▁ it was avery who answered . \\n▁ ` ` this means it is time for immortals to make inroads as immortals into the mortal world . \\n▁ and to do this , this means the council have already amended the immortal and mortal agreement . \\n▁ it means that not only will vampires be free to tame their concubines , they will be free to tame any mortal they desire . \\n▁ and lastly , '' his eyes moved to lucien , ` ` they will again be free to mate with mortals officially . \\n▁ the sentence has been done away with . \\n▁ they 'll be making an official statement on monday . '' \\n▁ lucien 's hand released the chair ; he turned and moved swiftly to the door . \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' gregor called , lucien stopped and turned back . \\n▁ but not because of gregor 's call . \\n▁ ` ` are these prophesies written ? '' \\n▁ he demanded . \\n▁ ` ` they are , '' gregor replied . \\n▁ ` ` but - '' lucien interrupted him , ` ` i must get to leah . \\n▁ later , you 'll arrange for me to read them . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's impossible , '' gregor returned . \\n▁ ` ` make it possible , '' lucien clipped . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't understand , '' gregor said carefully . \\n▁ ` ` and you can explain it to me after i speak with leah , '' lucien retorted . \\n▁ ` ` i might be able to arrange for you to see some of them but it is highly likely you 'll only be allowed to see those prophesies that do not concern you but instead the other two sets of lifemates in the triumvirate , '' gregor explained . \\n▁ ` ` pull strings , grease palms , exchange favors but find a way for me to read those prophesies , '' lucien gritted . \\n▁ ` ` luce , do you believe this nonsense ? '' \\n▁ stephanie asked in disbelief and lucien 's eyes cut to her . \\n▁ ` ` that leah 's my lifemate ? '' \\n▁ he asked , stephanie nodded and lucien finished , ` ` absolutely . '' \\n▁ stephanie 's head jerked right before her eyes narrowed and that was right before she grinned . \\n▁ ` ` okay , then do you believe about the prophesies ? '' \\n▁ she queried . \\n▁ ` ` if anything is written about leah and me , i want to read it whether it was written yesterday or three thousand years ago and whether i believe it or not , '' lucien replied . \\n▁ ` ` understandable , '' she muttered , still grinning . \\n▁ ` ` there is much still to talk about , '' gregor cut in and lucien 's eyes went to him . \\n▁ ` ` we 'll arrange another meeting . \\n▁ two weeks , '' he stated . \\n▁ gregor 's eyebrows shot up . \\n▁ ` ` two weeks ? '' \\n▁ ` ` gregor , i ' m about to walk out of this office , go home and ask the woman i love to spend eternity with me . \\n▁ yes , f * * king two weeks and consider yourself lucky i ' m not going to arrange a f * * king meeting until after two months . '' \\n▁ gregor 's eyes dipped to his knees but not before lucien saw them light . \\n▁ jesus , the vampire was n't entirely cold and unfeeling . \\n▁ this was good to know . \\n▁ on that thought , the door opened and lucien turned to it to see sally 's head stuck in . \\n▁ then his body went solid when he registered her pallor , her wide eyes and smelled her fear . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m so sorry , lucien . \\n▁ i know you said no interruptions but edwina 's on the phone and she said it 's a dire emergency . '' \\n▁ fuck , he 'd turned off his cell for this meeting . \\n▁ and with cosmo , stephanie and avery at the meeting , he 'd necessarily but unwillingly left leah unprotected . \\n▁ fuck ! \\n▁ he strode swiftly to his desk , forcing himself to do it at a mortal 's pace , demanding to know , ` ` what line ? '' \\n▁ ` ` one , '' sally replied . \\n▁ he yanked the phone out of its cradle , put it to his ear , hitting line one at the same time . \\n▁ ` ` edwina . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien , '' she breathed , her voice hitching . \\n▁ ` ` oh , lucien . '' \\n▁ ` ` talk to me , '' he ordered . \\n▁ ` ` your … your father , ka … katrina , marcello and um … i do n't know his name but there were four vampires here . \\n▁ they busted through the door . \\n▁ they - '' fuck . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ oh f * * k , no . \\n▁ ` ` leah ? '' \\n▁ he barked . \\n▁ ` ` she 's gone , '' edwina whispered and lucien 's gut twisted as his free hand curled into a fist and his chest started to burn . \\n▁ ` ` gone ? '' \\n▁ he whispered back , stunned at their audacity as well as livid . \\n▁ ` ` they took her ? '' \\n▁ ` ` no , no … she left . \\n▁ they , your father that is , he said the most awful things to her , lucien . \\n▁ you would n't … i could n't even believe it . \\n▁ he told her such awful things . \\n▁ and he told her about some woman named maggie . '' \\n▁ lucien closed his eyes as his fist tightened . \\n▁ he put it to his desk and leaned into it . \\n▁ edwina kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` he … he … oh lucien , i ' m sorry to tell you this about your own father but … he touched her . '' \\n▁ lucien opened his eyes but he saw nothing but red . \\n▁ ` ` he touched leah ? '' \\n▁ ` ` oh f * * k. '' he heard stephanie whisper but edwina was again talking . \\n▁ ` ` he touched her and he spoke to her , such vile things . \\n▁ she was … she was crying , lucien . \\n▁ it was … oh goodness , the look on her face . \\n▁ i 'll never forget it . \\n▁ i tried to explain but she … i ' m sorry , she packed her things and left . \\n▁ she was so desperate to get away , she left me tied up but called the police to come get me . \\n▁ they 're here now . \\n▁ they got here just minutes ago . \\n▁ i called you as soon as i - '' ` ` do not leave . \\n▁ do not make a complaint to the police but keep them there until i ' m home . \\n▁ i 'll bring others with me so you 'll be safe . '' \\n▁ ` ` all right , lucien , '' she whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i , uh … you should know , your father said they would be prepared for your response . '' \\n▁ fuck . \\n▁ ` ` did they harm you ? '' \\n▁ he asked belatedly . \\n▁ ` ` they scared me and taped me to a chair . \\n▁ it hurt when they ripped the tape off but i ' m fine . '' \\n▁ they would burn for the hurt edwina endured when the tape was ripped off . \\n▁ they would scream before they burned for attacking leah . \\n▁ and his father would beg for his life to end . \\n▁ and he 'd do this for a long f * * king time . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be home in twenty minutes , '' lucien told her . \\n▁ ` ` all right . '' \\n▁ he put the phone down and turned to see avery and the three vampires all on their feet . \\n▁ ` ` what do you need from us ? '' \\n▁ cosmo asked immediately . \\n▁ ` ` you hunt katrina , '' lucien ordered , cosmo 's face went hard but he nodded . \\n▁ lucien looked to stephanie . \\n▁ ` ` you bring me marcello . '' \\n▁ stephanie smiled a humorless smile before she nodded . \\n▁ lucien looked to gregor . \\n▁ ` ` there was another vampire there . \\n▁ i want to know who he was . '' \\n▁ gregor simply nodded . \\n▁ lucien looked to avery . \\n▁ ` ` gregor finds out , he tells you . \\n▁ you send rafe . '' \\n▁ avery tipped up his chin . \\n▁ ` ` they 're expecting you , '' lucien warned all of them . \\n▁ ` ` we heard , '' cosmo replied . \\n▁ lucien nodded and looked at avery . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll need you to follow me . \\n▁ guard edwina . '' \\n▁ avery lifted his chin . \\n▁ ` ` lucien moved to the door . \\n▁ ` ` are you hunting your father ? '' \\n▁ stephanie asked his back . \\n▁ ` ` no , he can wait , '' he turned , hand on the doorknob and looked at stephanie , ` ` i ' m hunting leah . '' \\n▁ he heard her indrawn breath but he walked out the door . \\n▁ chapter twenty - three the vow my eyes on the television set , i pulled the two scrunched pillows i was holding deeper into my body . \\n▁ i was curled tight around them , my neck bent , my cheek resting on the rough material . \\n▁ the tv was n't set to loud . \\n▁ this was because i wanted to hear what was happening outside . \\n▁ not that i could get away if lucien caught up with me . \\n▁ i just wanted the half a second i 'd have to prepare myself to die . \\n▁ but my mind was n't on the tv . \\n▁ my mind , as it had been for days , was on everything . \\n▁ would i be able to sleep that night , alone in a bed in a hotel room after spending weeks sleeping every night curled into a vampire ? \\n▁ where would i go tomorrow ? \\n▁ north , south , east , west ? \\n▁ canada ? \\n▁ mexico ? \\n▁ should i take the chance to phone my family ? \\n▁ i 'd left nine days ago and it was likely they 'd been informed i 'd escaped and they were probably worried about me . \\n▁ not to mention , it would be my last chance to speak to them if lucien was enraged when he caught up with me , went the way of the vampire and took my life . \\n▁ i clearly did n't know him -lrb- at all -rrb- but what i now knew of him , i convinced myself he would go the way of the vamp . \\n▁ and lastly , wondering how much time i had and if i should just stop moving , let him catch me and be done with it . \\n▁ i was ready to die and this was messing with my head too . \\n▁ it was sick and crazy but i was tired , hungry , heartbroken , on the run and i knew to my soul my future was f * * ked . \\n▁ i 'd fallen hard for a vampire who 'd spent months playing me against me . \\n▁ and i was just so done with it . \\n▁ but weirdly , considering what lucien had done to me , i had to admit that a lot of my xxunk was taken up with worry about things his father had said . \\n▁ things that meant lucien was in danger in a variety of ways . \\n▁ i should n't care , i knew it . \\n▁ but i did . \\n▁ i was totally messed up . \\n▁ and then there was the incessant beating myself up . \\n▁ asking myself why i was so stupid . \\n▁ asking myself when would i learn . \\n▁ i tried to cut myself some slack . \\n▁ he was lucien and there were n't a lot of men like him -lrb- in fact , none -rrb- . \\n▁ he 'd worked hard at it , vowed to break me . \\n▁ and a vampire vow was a bond . \\n▁ so , obviously , he pulled out all the stops to succeed . \\n▁ but i could n't cut myself any slack . \\n▁ my decisions were my own . \\n▁ my capitulation was on me . \\n▁ my flight and the consequences of it were mine to bear . \\n▁ i knew it would hurt my family which made it harder for me not to call them . \\n▁ but i told myself , if what etienne said was true , it might be time for the buchanan women to get out of the concubine business . \\n▁ i stared unseeing at the tv . \\n▁ this was the ninth hotel room i 'd been in . \\n▁ i splurged this time . \\n▁ i 'd stayed in crappy places off the beaten track the last eight nights . \\n▁ but i was tired . \\n▁ i 'd had little sleep . \\n▁ this place was n't great and it certainly was n't the luxury i 'd grown accustomed to . \\n▁ it was old but at least it was clean . \\n▁ i needed clean . \\n▁ i needed sleep . \\n▁ hunger pains gnawed at my gut but i knew i could n't eat . \\n▁ i 'd tried . \\n▁ the thought of it made me nauseous and the one time i tried to eat something it made me flat out sick . \\n▁ so i stopped trying . \\n▁ i just drove wherever my hands on the steering wheel took me . \\n▁ i drank loads of coffee to stay awake . \\n▁ then i found a place to settle in and pray for sleep . \\n▁ but sleep eluded me . \\n▁ i was so damned tired . \\n▁ i 'd never been that tired . \\n▁ that hungry . \\n▁ i 'd never been that heartbroken . \\n▁ i missed him . \\n▁ i missed my vampire who would never be mine . \\n▁ i missed him every second of every day i was away from him . \\n▁ and i hated myself for it . \\n▁ i felt the tears gather in my eyes and i blinked them away , trying to concentrate on the tv screen . \\n▁ this did n't work . \\n▁ i knew it but i did n't give up . \\n▁ every night , the tears came and no matter how i 'd struggle to beat them , they 'd always silently fall . \\n▁ if this was a romance novel and he was n't lucien , i could believe we were lifemates . \\n▁ my tears and heartbreak were n't about knowing i was on the run from the man i loved who would find me and kill me . \\n▁ they were about losing the man i loved -lrb- see ? \\n▁ messed up ! -rrb- . \\n▁ i 'd never felt this way when a relationship ended with one of my other boyfriends . \\n▁ i did n't even know you could feel this badly . \\n▁ i did n't know this kind of pain existed . \\n▁ i wished i still did n't know . \\n▁ i was cold . \\n▁ i was wearing a pale pink cotton nightgown that fell to my knees and had a wide v - neck and short sleeves . \\n▁ i 'd stopped and bought a few and some underwear so i could throw away the stuff lucien gave me . \\n▁ to try to warm up , i curled my knees tighter to my chest . \\n▁ i was too exhausted even to move to get under the covers . \\n▁ the tears slid out the sides of my eyes making the tv screen blurry and i sighed . \\n▁ i wondered , if i actually managed to get to sleep , if i 'd have the nightmare . \\n▁ i had n't thought of that when i took off and each night this thought also served to keep me awake . \\n▁ but in the snatches of broken sleep i was able to get , it did n't come . \\n▁ i knew what this meant . \\n▁ we 'd been connected even if it was in a f * * ked up way . \\n▁ now we were not . \\n▁ who would have thought i 'd ever want that dream back ? \\n▁ it stunk but i did . \\n▁ i wanted any connection to him . \\n▁ even a connection that might bizarrely kill me . \\n▁ jeez , i was messed up . \\n▁ totally . \\n▁ i sighed again , the tears slowed and my eyelids started to feel heavy . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ sleep , please . \\n▁ i needed sleep . \\n▁ the tears stopped and my eyelids drooped . \\n▁ yes , sleep . \\n▁ i blinked slowly then closed my eyes . \\n▁ then , thankfully , nothing . \\n▁ * * * * * i woke and instantly knew he was there because i could feel his fingers wrapped around my ankle . \\n▁ knowing i would n't succeed but doing it anyway , i tensed for flight . \\n▁ then i felt my ankle jerked . \\n▁ suddenly , my body was on its back and the weight of lucien was on top of me . \\n▁ he had his long fingers around my jaw , his palm warm against my throat . \\n▁ i 'd fallen asleep with the lights on . \\n▁ i could see him right there , his face an inch away , his eyes filled with heat . \\n▁ hungry . \\n▁ i felt my heart hammering in my chest , fear burning through me , my fingers and legs tingling . \\n▁ ` ` leah , '' he whispered , my name coarse on his lips . \\n▁ i did n't speak . \\n▁ i waited for whatever would befall me . \\n▁ it sucked but i was ready . \\n▁ nine days . \\n▁ it took him nine days to find me . \\n▁ i was surprised and impressed . \\n▁ not impressed in a good way but still that was pretty unbelievable . \\n▁ ` ` i have n't fed in nine days , sweetling , '' he murmured . \\n▁ sweetling . \\n▁ still persisting in this charade when we both knew it was way over . \\n▁ god , i hated him . \\n▁ but this surprised me . \\n▁ i vaguely wondered why he had n't fed . \\n▁ then again , if he was going to drain me dry , he 'd need to be super hungry . \\n▁ ` ` sweetheart , i need to feed , '' he whispered . \\n▁ i swallowed , my throat moving against his palm , my mind hazy with exhaustion , wondering why it seemed he was asking for permission to kill me . \\n▁ maybe it was some crazy vampire tradition . \\n▁ i did the only thing i could do . \\n▁ and anyway , i might as well get it over with . \\n▁ i turned my head to the side , exposing my neck , his hand moving with me . \\n▁ i just hoped he anesthetized me . \\n▁ i did n't want to die but i really did n't want to experience that agonizing pain before doing it . \\n▁ i sensed his head dip but i definitely felt his tongue move up my neck . \\n▁ i licked my lips . \\n▁ that felt good and i was pleased he did n't intend to hurt me unduly before he killed me . \\n▁ but as good as it felt -lrb- and it felt great , as always , which also sucked -rrb- i would n't allow myself to react . \\n▁ then his tongue moved down . \\n▁ i felt the numbness then i felt him feeding . \\n▁ my eyes closed slowly and i finally found it fortunate i was so tired . \\n▁ i did n't have the energy or strength to react no matter how good it felt . \\n▁ his hand moved . \\n▁ his thumb tenderly gliding over my lips , his fingers drifting over my cheek , down my jaw , down to wrap around the side of my neck and pull me up as he deepened the suction . \\n▁ god , i used to love it when he did that . \\n▁ and even right then , as exhausted as i was , i felt a faint tingle in my ni * * les and between my legs . \\n▁ his thumb moved , stroking my throat and that , i thought , was so lucien . \\n▁ even while killing me , he was playing the game , pretending gentleness , giving me something beautiful . \\n▁ my eyes opened slowly and just as slowly closed again . \\n▁ god , i was so exhausted . \\n▁ i was n't going to fight no matter how futile it would be . \\n▁ i had nothing left in me . \\n▁ i was n't even going to stay awake through my death . \\n▁ this , i decided , was probably good . \\n▁ lucien 's weight , his heat , his feeding , his big , warm hand at my neck , his thumb stroking soothingly , his other arm wrapped around me tight , my eyelids fluttered one last time . \\n▁ so he 'd give me a beautiful death . \\n▁ that was lucien too . \\n▁ i let go , allowed the glory of his feeding to overwhelm me then i drifted into oblivion . \\n▁ * * * * * ` ` it may take a few days . \\n▁ i need to see to leah . '' \\n▁ as i swam toward consciousness , i heard lucien 's deep voice saying these words quietly . \\n▁ then i heard , ` ` i do n't know . \\n▁ what i do know is she has n't been seeing to herself . \\n▁ nine days and she 's lost an alarming amount of weight . \\n▁ her color is not good , there are shadows under her eyes and she fell asleep during a feeding . '' \\n▁ there was a pause and then , ` ` yes , xxunk , during . '' \\n▁ i struggled against the weight of the fatigue that still held me in its grip . \\n▁ this was aided by the fact i was held snug and tight to lucien 's side , part of my body on top of his , my cheek resting on his chest . \\n▁ lucien kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be moving her to a decent hotel , feeding her , getting her rest . \\n▁ then we 'll be talking . \\n▁ i do n't want to start the journey home until i ' m satisfied she 's fit for it . \\n▁ so hold them . \\n▁ i 'll deal with them when i return . '' \\n▁ another pause then , ` ` if you wish . \\n▁ play with them all you like . '' \\n▁ what was he talking about ? \\n▁ and more importantly , why was i alive and being held snug and tight to lucien ? \\n▁ my eyes opened then i blinked . \\n▁ lucien 's arm around my back shifted , his hand drifting up my spine , his fingers tangling in my hair . \\n▁ ` ` she 's awake , xxunk . \\n▁ i 'll phone you later when i know more . '' \\n▁ his fingers moved , twisting a lock and my heart skipped a beat . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ we 'll speak soon . '' \\n▁ then i heard a beep and i knew he was done . \\n▁ i had a second to process this before lucien shifted . \\n▁ he ended settled on his side , his other arm going around me , pulling me up so my head was not on his chest but on the pillow and i was eye - to - eye with him . \\n▁ god , his eyes were beautiful . \\n▁ nine days and i thought i remembered everything but i forgot just how beautiful his eyes were . \\n▁ ` ` you slept deep , sweetling . \\n▁ how do you feel ? '' \\n▁ he asked gently , his fingers still playing in my hair , his other arm holding me close to his heat . \\n▁ ` ` uh … what 's going on ? '' \\n▁ i whispered cautiously . \\n▁ ` ` you 're about to tell me how you feel , '' he replied . \\n▁ ` ` well … uh … '' i trailed off . \\n▁ he had n't killed me . \\n▁ in fact , looking at him , he did n't look angry at all . \\n▁ he looked like lucien except better . \\n▁ way better . \\n▁ his eyes filled with concern and a warmth so deep i 'd never seen anything like it . \\n▁ his face was soft . \\n▁ his voice was gentle and quiet . \\n▁ was this part of the taming ? \\n▁ your prey figured it out , took off and you got to go after her and do it all over again ? \\n▁ oh god , i hoped that was n't it . \\n▁ like , i really , really hoped that was n't it . \\n▁ seriously , i preferred it if he 'd kill me . \\n▁ ` ` when 's the last time you ate ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked when i trailed off and did n't start again . \\n▁ ` ` you mean , ate and kept something down ? '' \\n▁ i asked back and watched his eyes flash and his mouth go hard . \\n▁ oh boy . \\n▁ ` ` yes , the last time you ate and kept it down , '' he replied , his voice now tight but somehow not menacing . \\n▁ ` ` well , the night before … '' oh shit . \\n▁ i did n't want to go where i had to go . \\n▁ well , i had to say it because i knew he would n't let it go . \\n▁ ` ` the night before i took off . '' \\n▁ ` ` ten days , '' he murmured , surprising me when he looked thoughtful , not angry at my mention of my escape , his arms going tight , his eyes moving over my face then they locked on mine . \\n▁ ` ` that was foolish , my pet . '' \\n▁ okay . \\n▁ now . \\n▁ seriously . \\n▁ what was happening ? \\n▁ ` ` we need to get you food , '' he declared . \\n▁ ` ` do you have the strength to go with me to a restaurant or do you wish for me to go and bring something back ? \\n▁ if the latter , tell me what you 'd like . \\n▁ and i 'll warn you , you ' ve slept twelve straight hours , not counting however long you were asleep before i found you . \\n▁ it 's not morning . \\n▁ it 's one in the afternoon . '' \\n▁ learning this , i felt my eyes go wide as my lips parted . \\n▁ then i felt my stomach flutter when he took in this look , his face again went soft and his fingers stopped playing in my hair and fisted gently in it . \\n▁ still , he 'd just asked me what i wished and inferred he 'd go off and do as i asked . \\n▁ was this a new tactic ? \\n▁ ` ` uh … '' i mumbled , not alert enough to process this , defend myself , figure out what was happening . \\n▁ not alert enough for anything . \\n▁ he rolled me so i was on my back , he was looming over me but his torso was deep in mine and his face was super close . \\n▁ ` ` leah , my love , we can not delay in getting you fed and rested . \\n▁ we need to get back home . \\n▁ there is much we need to discuss but more , there is much that needs to be done . \\n▁ xxunk and cosmo have captured katrina and marcello . \\n▁ the council has sanctioned their torture and burning and i need to get back and see to that . \\n▁ so now i need to find you food , feed you , get you in a decent bed with sheets that do n't feel like cardboard , you need to rest , we need to talk then we need to go home . '' \\n▁ okay , there was a lot there . \\n▁ first , he 'd called me his ` ` love '' . \\n▁ he 'd never done that . \\n▁ never , ever , ever . \\n▁ second , the council sanctioned torture and burning ? \\n▁ third , lucien was going to ` ` see to that '' ? \\n▁ ` ` what 's going on ? '' \\n▁ i repeated . \\n▁ ` ` leah - '' ` ` lucien , '' i cut him off . \\n▁ ` ` what is going on ? '' \\n▁ ` ` we 'll talk about it later , after you ' ve eaten , you have some of your strength back and we ' ve moved to a different hotel . '' \\n▁ ` ` we 'll talk about it now . '' \\n▁ ` ` later , leah . '' \\n▁ ` ` now , lucien ! '' \\n▁ i snapped , still fatigued , definitely , but not so fatigued i was going to fall for his games . \\n▁ not again . \\n▁ and he needed to know that . \\n▁ ` ` i want to know what 's going on , now , not later . \\n▁ i do n't want to die ` at home ' as you put it . \\n▁ i do n't understand why you 're delaying it . \\n▁ i do n't get why you 're still playing me . \\n▁ just do it . \\n▁ drain me and get on with your life . '' \\n▁ his brows shot up . \\n▁ ` ` drain you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' i hissed . \\n▁ ` ` i knew when i left that you 'd hunt me and i knew leaving you gave you the right to feed until i was dead . \\n▁ so what are you waiting for ? '' \\n▁ his brows knitted , his eyes narrowed but contradictory to the ominous look stamped on his features , his hand left my hair to frame the side of my face . \\n▁ and furthering his contradictions , his voice was soft and sweet when he replied , ` ` i ' m annoyed with you for making the very unwise decision to attempt to escape me considering the danger you knew was inherent being away from me when you might dream . \\n▁ not to mention , you and edwina had been attacked by vampires who stated vile intentions so you also knew the dangers were not singular but many . \\n▁ nevertheless , it would be reckless of me to punish you for carrying through this rash decision by killing you , my pet , considering that would significantly f * * k with my plans for spending eternity with you . '' \\n▁ i stopped breathing . \\n▁ yes , stopped breathing . \\n▁ entirely . \\n▁ so it came out in a gust of air when i forced a , ` ` what ? '' \\n▁ lucien smiled and he used his whole face to do it . \\n▁ i 'd never seen him smile that openly and the effect was staggering . \\n▁ then he dipped his face closer to mine and whispered , ` ` i plan to spend eternity with you . '' \\n▁ i stared . \\n▁ then i whispered back , ` ` you do ? '' \\n▁ he nodded . \\n▁ ` ` i do . '' \\n▁ ` ` i. . . \\n▁ i. . . '' \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ was he serious ? \\n▁ or was this another game ? \\n▁ ` ` how ? \\n▁ why ? \\n▁ when did you … ? \\n▁ but you ca n't , '' i stammered . \\n▁ ` ` i can , '' he replied . \\n▁ ` ` but , it 's against the rules , '' i reminded him . \\n▁ ` ` the rules have changed , '' he informed me . \\n▁ oh boy . \\n▁ here we go again . \\n▁ lucien doing whatever he wanted to do and f * * k the consequences . \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' then he was n't lying on top of me and i was n't on my back . \\n▁ he was on his ass in the bed and i was straddling him . \\n▁ one of his arms was tight around my back holding my body close to his . \\n▁ his other hand had sifted in my hair , cupping the back of my head and holding my face super close to his . \\n▁ the instant he got us in this position , before i processed i was in it and therefore was by no means ready for what he was going to say next -lrb- not that i ever would be -rrb- , he stated , ` ` i ' m in love with you , sweetheart . '' \\n▁ oh my god ! \\n▁ was he … ? \\n▁ no . \\n▁ no ! \\n▁ ` ` do n't , '' i whispered , pain piercing through me and i watched lucien blink . \\n▁ ` ` do n't ? '' \\n▁ he whispered back . \\n▁ ` ` do n't do it again . \\n▁ do n't play me , '' i explained quietly and i watched the gentleness fade from his features as fury infused them . \\n▁ i braced . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m in love with you , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` do n't , '' i whispered , that word breaking in the middle and his hold on me tightened mightily . \\n▁ ` ` leah … i ' m … in … love with you , '' he growled , i opened my mouth but his arms squeezed so hard all breath left me . \\n▁ ` ` he lied to you . \\n▁ my father lied . \\n▁ i told you i did not respect him and you knew he was not a man to be respected . \\n▁ eating lunch with him , you figured it out . \\n▁ and at lunch , he was on his best behavior . \\n▁ during the attack , he treated you to exactly the vampire he really is . \\n▁ he lied , leah . \\n▁ edwina told me what he said and what he said to you about what 's between you and me , every bit of it , was a f * * king lie . '' \\n▁ i wanted to believe that . \\n▁ i really did . \\n▁ but … before i could even think through my ` ` but '' , lucien sensed there was one and kept talking . \\n▁ ` ` there are things i 'll explain more fully when i ' ve seen to the woman i love but for now , the council has amended the immortal and mortal agreement . \\n▁ vampires are again free to take mortal mates . \\n▁ and i ' m taking my mortal as mate . \\n▁ you love me , i love you , we 're connected , what we have is beautiful and that 's all it 'll ever be . \\n▁ for eternity . \\n▁ until the end of days . \\n▁ until the sun falls from the sky , all you and i will share is beauty . '' \\n▁ i felt my heart leap , tears fill my eyes and hope suffuse my system . \\n▁ but what came from my mouth was simply a whispered , breathy , ` ` please . '' \\n▁ i did n't even know why i said it but lucien did . \\n▁ so he replied in a voice filled with tenderness , ` ` yes , my love . \\n▁ i ' m not lying . \\n▁ i am not playing you . \\n▁ swear to god , this is all truth . '' \\n▁ he pulled me even closer . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , leah . \\n▁ i ' ve loved you for twenty years and i 'll love you for eternity . \\n▁ my beautiful leah , listen closely . \\n▁ what i say is pure truth . \\n▁ and on this truth , you have my vow . '' \\n▁ the tears slid out of my eyes , coursing down my cheeks . \\n▁ i knew lucien saw them but his eyes never left mine . \\n▁ and mine did n't leave his . \\n▁ i looked deep . \\n▁ i felt his arms around me , his big , strong body and i paid close attention to the wonder of his vow sinking deep . \\n▁ he loved me . \\n▁ the mighty vampire lucien loved me . \\n▁ oh god . \\n▁ that felt great . \\n▁ i pushed my hands that were trapped between us up until my fingers could curl around his neck and i whispered , ` ` you can be bossy and annoying . \\n▁ i can just be annoying . \\n▁ we 're going to fight . \\n▁ so my guess is , we 'll clash , like a lot . \\n▁ therefore it will be awesome but it wo n't be an eternity of just beauty . '' \\n▁ i barely got the last syllable out before his hand at my head crushed my mouth down to his . \\n▁ our lips opened , our tongues dueled and then i was on my back giving everything to my vampire and experiencing the beauty of finally , finally getting everything from my vampire in return . \\n▁ and , let me tell you , it was amazing . \\n▁ after a long time , he lifted his head and i dazedly opened my eyes to see his heated but gentle , searing into me . \\n▁ ` ` right . \\n▁ that 's done , '' he declared . \\n▁ ` ` now tell me , what do you f * * king want to eat ? '' \\n▁ i stared up at my vampire . \\n▁ then i burst out laughing . \\n▁ * * * * * i blinked the sleep away hearing from a distance lucien talking and i knew he was again on the phone . \\n▁ i stared across the sheets that did not , by a long shot , feel like cardboard . \\n▁ lucien had fed me . \\n▁ after our kiss , suddenly ravenous in a way that did n't mingle with nausea , i 'd asked for burritos . \\n▁ lucien told me burritos were out of the question considering i should have something bland and filled with vitamins and energy in my stomach after not eating for ten days . \\n▁ i told him i had a craving for burritos . \\n▁ he told me there was no way in hell i was getting burritos . \\n▁ i asked him why he asked me what i wanted when he was going to get me what he thought i should have anyway . \\n▁ he kissed me until i was dazed , left me in bed and then came back fifteen minutes later with a bunch of bananas and a jar of chunky peanut butter . \\n▁ i sat cross - legged in bed , using a plastic knife to gouge out peanut butter and glop it on my two bananas , eating them all the while glaring at lucien who was seeing to the not taxing chore of packing up my things . \\n▁ i did n't admit to him i loved bananas and peanut butter and it tasted awesome . \\n▁ i also did n't admit it filled me up and made me feel human for the first time in days . \\n▁ i dressed . \\n▁ lucien dragged my stuff to his porsche . \\n▁ we got in and he drove us forty - five minutes to the nearest city . \\n▁ upon entering the city , like it had a homing beacon and lucien was the receptor , he guided us straight to what had to be the most exclusive hotel in the city . \\n▁ he valet parked , grabbed one of my bags and his only bag and walked us in . \\n▁ he then proceeded to check us into the presidential suite which had its own butler -lrb- no joke ! -rrb- . \\n▁ we took the elevator up and lucien let us in . \\n▁ it was phenomenal . \\n▁ i lived in a mansion and the man who loved me was a billionaire and still , i 'd never seen anything so opulent . \\n▁ lucien ordered me to take a shower and get in bed . \\n▁ i told lucien i wanted to explore our sumptuous suite . \\n▁ he repeated he wanted me in the shower then in bed . \\n▁ i told him it would take ten whole minutes for me to look around so he should just keep his pants on . \\n▁ approximately three second later both lucien and i were naked , in the shower and he was turning on the water . \\n▁ at least i got to see the bathroom before he led me to the bedroom and gave me one of his long sleeved tees . \\n▁ he then made a point by digging through my bags and depositing my new nighties right in the trash . \\n▁ his point being discount department store nighties were not good enough for his leah . \\n▁ i rolled my eyes but i did n't protest . \\n▁ they were cute and comfy . \\n▁ what they were not was the finest silk and lace . \\n▁ he then ordered me to bed . \\n▁ unfortunately , after a long , hot shower with lucien , i had nothing in reserve . \\n▁ i pulled on his tee , crawled in bed and slept . \\n▁ this brought me to now . \\n▁ it was dark in the room but there was light coming around the not entirely closed door to the sitting room . \\n▁ i felt rested but again starved . \\n▁ tossing back the covers , i listened to his murmurings as i hit the bathroom . \\n▁ it was bigger than the living room in my old condo . \\n▁ wow . \\n▁ really , this suite was it . \\n▁ i wanted to live there . \\n▁ i did my thing , wandered out through the bedroom and to the door . \\n▁ before i got the door open , i knew lucien 's eyes were on it . \\n▁ i knew this because when the door was open they were on me . \\n▁ he was sitting in the chair at the desk . \\n▁ his cell held to his ear , he lifted up his chin to me then gestured with his hand to his lap . \\n▁ i wandered his way , pushing up the sleeves of his tee . \\n▁ when i got within reaching distance , lucien reached . \\n▁ then my ass was in his lap and his arm was wrapped around me . \\n▁ ` ` no , i 'll do it , '' he said into the phone as i settled in , cheek to his shoulder , my forehead pressed to his neck . \\n▁ his arm got tighter . \\n▁ ` ` i understand , '' he went on . \\n▁ ` ` but it will be me who hunts him . '' \\n▁ i sighed . \\n▁ lucien 's arm got tighter . \\n▁ then his voice was quiet when he continued , ` ` julian , i know this attack was perpetrated on the family . \\n▁ and yes , normally you would be correct that every member of the family is within their rights to exact vengeance . \\n▁ and you know i appreciate your and bel 's show of loyalty . \\n▁ you both can be there when i deal with him . \\n▁ but it will be me and only me who hunts etienne . '' \\n▁ well , the good part of that was that julian and isobel had their father and my backs and clearly thought of me as family . \\n▁ the bad part was that lucien was intending to hunt down his father . \\n▁ i was n't entirely surprised by this . \\n▁ he loved me and i loved that he loved me . \\n▁ i was certain it was partly about that . \\n▁ but his father had touched me , scared me and was just plain old mean to me . \\n▁ i knew lucien enough that i knew he would n't let that be . \\n▁ i did n't like etienne . \\n▁ he scared the xxunk out of me . \\n▁ still , hunting him down , torturing and burning him was pretty extreme . \\n▁ ` ` right , '' lucien continued . \\n▁ ` ` leah is up , she needs to eat then i need to feed . \\n▁ i ' m turning my cell off now . \\n▁ i want no further interruptions tonight . \\n▁ i 'll phone you tomorrow . '' \\n▁ he needed to feed and he wanted no further interruptions . \\n▁ i liked this idea . \\n▁ ` ` goodnight , julian . \\n▁ my love to bel , '' he muttered , i heard a beep then i saw his phone clatter on the desk . \\n▁ i lifted my head to look at him . \\n▁ ` ` is it time to talk ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' he answered , reached out to the hotel phone on the desk , grabbed the receiver and put it to his ear . \\n▁ then he stated , ` ` we 're ready to order dinner . '' \\n▁ then , without another word , he put it down . \\n▁ ` ` that was kind of abrupt , '' i told him . \\n▁ ` ` i do n't have the time or inclination to befriend a man i 'll see occasionally the length of our stay here and never see again . \\n▁ you 're rested . \\n▁ your color is back . \\n▁ you 're sitting in my lap with no underwear on . \\n▁ we were separated for nine days and reunited for one , the vast majority of which you ' ve been sleeping . \\n▁ i want you fed and you 'll eat sitting next to me not wearing any underwear . \\n▁ then i want to feed and do it while i ' m inside you . \\n▁ you need your strength . \\n▁ that , at the moment , is all i have time for . '' \\n▁ i was blinking at him , half turned on -lrb- okay , fully turned on -rrb- when out of nowhere a man wearing a spiffy hotel uniform walked into the room . \\n▁ lucien wrapped me tight in both arms and looked up at him . \\n▁ ` ` dinner , sir ? '' \\n▁ he prompted . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' lucien replied then launched into it . \\n▁ ` ` a french baton . \\n▁ pate xxunk gras with truffles . \\n▁ two fillet xxunk rare with xxunk sauce . \\n▁ sauteed potatoes . \\n▁ fine greens . \\n▁ rolls . \\n▁ a bottle of red , a bordeaux . \\n▁ this followed with two chocolate creme xxunk and a bottle of xxunk . '' \\n▁ it seemed while i was sleeping that lucien had familiarized himself with the menu and it was clear he was in the mood for french food . \\n▁ this was good since all that sounded great . \\n▁ ` ` yes sir , '' the hotel butler murmured . \\n▁ ` ` bring the creme xxunk and xxunk half an hour after you serve the main and then do n't disturb us for the rest of the night . '' \\n▁ he nodded , muttering , ` ` as you wish , '' then moved out of the room . \\n▁ okay , that was still abrupt but one could not say this presidential suite business was n't totally cool . \\n▁ on that thought we were up , me held in lucien 's arms and he was striding across the room . \\n▁ i barely got my arms around his shoulders when we were down again . \\n▁ me on my back in the couch , lucien partially on me , partially with his side in the seat . \\n▁ his head was up , his eyes on me and he lifted a hand , trailed a finger down the side of my face then curled all of them around my neck . \\n▁ ` ` you remembered the xxunk sauce , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` of course , '' he whispered back . \\n▁ ` ` we ' ve something to celebrate if belatedly . '' \\n▁ i felt my nose begin to sting . \\n▁ then i whispered , ` ` they 'll probably make it better than me . '' \\n▁ ` ` undoubtedly . '' \\n▁ i grinned then it faded and i ordered , ` ` tell me you love me . '' \\n▁ his hand slid up my neck , my jaw to cup my cheek as his head dipped closer . \\n▁ ` ` i love you , sweetling . '' \\n▁ dinner sounded great . \\n▁ but those words sounded better than anything . \\n▁ i sighed , my arm moving around him and i turned to my side . \\n▁ lucien shifted with me so we were face - to - face and in each other 's arms . \\n▁ ` ` why did n't you say it before ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` because i could n't , '' he answered immediately . \\n▁ ` ` because i had n't admitted it to myself . \\n▁ not when you gave that to me . \\n▁ not before . \\n▁ not for twenty years . \\n▁ if i admitted it to myself twenty years ago , i would n't allow myself to have you because i knew if i did , i would n't let you go . \\n▁ when i had you , i would n't admit it again because i would n't let you go . \\n▁ i was already flying in the face of the rules of the dominion with what i would allow us to have . \\n▁ they were going to accept that , i knew . \\n▁ they owe me . \\n▁ but they 'd never allow me to take you as mate . \\n▁ we could do it but they would hunt us , eventually find us and we 'd be given the sentence . \\n▁ i had to protect you from that . '' \\n▁ his eyes went strange and i knew why when he finished , ` ` but it seems i failed at protecting you from everything . '' \\n▁ ` ` it worked out in the end , '' i whispered reassuringly on an arm squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' lucien replied , not looking or sounding very reassured . \\n▁ i decided to change the subject to a far happier one . \\n▁ ` ` why did they change their minds so suddenly about immortals mating mortals ? '' \\n▁ ` ` they had their reasons , '' he answered vaguely . \\n▁ it had to be said , i was n't in the mood for vague . \\n▁ i 'd had a lot of vague not to mention seriously vague -lrb- in other words , stuff kept from me -rrb- . \\n▁ therefore i was so over vague . \\n▁ ` ` seems strange , '' i probed , ` ` all the trouble they took , all the heartbreak they caused , five hundred years and then , poof , '' i fluttered a hand in the air , ` ` whatever . \\n▁ mate with mortals . \\n▁ we do n't care . '' \\n▁ lucien grinned then clarified , ` ` all right , my love , how about they had very good reasons . '' \\n▁ ` ` war ? '' \\n▁ i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` yes , amongst other things . '' \\n▁ ` ` etienne told me about their plans and - '' ` ` do n't worry about it . '' \\n▁ do n't worry about it ? \\n▁ was he crazy ? \\n▁ ` ` lucien , what he told me was pretty scary . \\n▁ and they did n't say it straight out but it seemed you 're a specific target . \\n▁ how am i not supposed to worry about that ? '' \\n▁ his arms gave me a squeeze . \\n▁ his voice was low and firm when he repeated , ` ` leah , my love , do n't worry about it . \\n▁ you know i can take care of myself . \\n▁ what i must do is be certain i take better care of you . '' \\n▁ that was nice , very nice . \\n▁ still , i studied him and i did it closely . \\n▁ then i noted , ` ` you 're not going to share , are you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` not now , no . \\n▁ i need to have a meeting with a member of the council , discuss things and if it 's safe for you to know , i 'll tell you . '' \\n▁ i had a feeling i had no choice but to leave it at that . \\n▁ so i left it at that and changed the subject again . \\n▁ ` ` you did n't feed , '' i whispered and his arms gave me another squeeze . \\n▁ ` ` you do n't like me taking from anyone but you . \\n▁ i do n't like to feed from anyone but you . \\n▁ so i did n't feed until i found you . '' \\n▁ god , that was so sweet . \\n▁ ` ` thank you , '' i said softly and lucien leaned into me to touch his mouth to mine . \\n▁ when he pulled away again , i held his eyes . \\n▁ i did n't want to go where we had to go but we had to go there . \\n▁ we were starting an eternity together . \\n▁ there were a few things to get straight . \\n▁ ` ` you kept a lot from me , '' i said quietly trying not to make an accusation sound like one . \\n▁ ` ` i did , pet , and i ' m sorry , '' he replied . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ lucien sighed then pulled me closer . \\n▁ ` ` first , i did n't tell you about the restrictions against physical intimacy and living together because i knew you well already . \\n▁ and knowing you , i knew i had my hands full . \\n▁ i did n't need you having more ammunition to use to keep yourself from me . '' \\n▁ this , i had to admit , was true . \\n▁ ` ` second , i did n't tell you about maggie because it served no purpose . '' \\n▁ ` ` it 's a part of you , a part of your history , '' i reminded him . \\n▁ ` ` and i was falling in love with you . \\n▁ but even if i was n't we were sharing our lives together and would being doing so for a while . \\n▁ you already knew everything about me and you had to know i wanted to know everything about you . \\n▁ ` ` i did , sweetheart , but i 'll remind you we ' ve known each other a very short time and only a small portion of that has been time you ' ve let me in . \\n▁ i can not say , had my father not intervened , if i would have told you . \\n▁ but it 's likely . \\n▁ you 're right , i intended for you to be a part of my life for years to come which would mean you being around my friends and family . \\n▁ there was a high probability someone might let something slip . \\n▁ secrets have a way of revealing themselves and , i tell you true , when you learned about maggie , i would have wanted it to come from me . '' \\n▁ ` ` i believe you , '' i said softly and that got me lucien 's smile . \\n▁ then he went on gently , ` ` edwina told me what my father said . \\n▁ and part of it is true . \\n▁ i loved her . \\n▁ i thought i 'd spend the rest of eternity with her and i was happy with that . \\n▁ we were together for seventy - five years . \\n▁ i was a young vampire when i met her but i knew my heart and her place in it . '' \\n▁ okay , suddenly , i did n't want to know so much about maggie . \\n▁ lucien read my face and gathered me even closer as he leaned into me , pressing me partially on back and he kept going . \\n▁ ` ` but she died , leah . \\n▁ her death incensed me and i avenged it . \\n▁ it took decades , blood was spilled , lives were lost but i avenged maggie 's . \\n▁ and baring this to you , you also need to know that until very recently , i had not recovered from her loss . \\n▁ that was how much i loved her . \\n▁ she was a good woman and she made me happy . '' \\n▁ my face must have given something away because lucien got closer and his arms got tighter . \\n▁ ` ` she was a good woman , my love , and she made me happy . \\n▁ i missed her . \\n▁ i hate having the knowledge in my brain that she endured what she endured prior to her death at the hands of my people simply because she fell in love with a vampire . \\n▁ and that love will always be true . \\n▁ but i have not lied to you the times i told you i 'd never had more beautiful than what i have with you . \\n▁ you are what i ' ve been looking for for five hundred years . \\n▁ you and me , we were meant to be . \\n▁ maggie was my mate but she is gone . \\n▁ you are my lifemate . '' \\n▁ i sucked in breath as my heart flipped over and whispered , ` ` you believe in lifemates ? '' \\n▁ ` ` i did n't until the day you told me you loved me and i could no longer deny i felt the same for you . \\n▁ then i did . \\n▁ absolutely . '' \\n▁ his tone was firm , his eyes held mine , his gaze was unwavering and intense . \\n▁ he meant it . \\n▁ absolutely . \\n▁ ` ` even running from you , believing your father , still , the pain i felt losing you , i often thought if we were in a romance novel , we 'd be lifemates , '' i admitted . \\n▁ lucien 's eyes grew warm and his arms relaxed . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m sorry you lost her and the way you lost her , lucien , '' i whispered . \\n▁ ` ` i am too , '' lucien whispered back . \\n▁ i kept going . \\n▁ ` ` and i ' m sorry i believed etienne , took off and did n't talk to you . '' \\n▁ his lips twitched and he repeated , ` ` i am too . '' \\n▁ ` ` still , '' i started to defend myself , ` ` you kept things from me and - '' his hand came up to curve around my jaw and his thumb slid to press against my lips . \\n▁ ` ` my father attacking you was his decision , he carried it through and he 'll bear the consequences . '' \\n▁ his thumb slid from my lip and along my cheek . \\n▁ ` ` but you are correct . \\n▁ it was me who kept things from you , even after the taming was complete , which left it open for my father to plant those seeds . \\n▁ that was my error in judgment . \\n▁ and i left you unprotected . \\n▁ i did n't think i would be gone that long . \\n▁ i had no idea they were lying in wait to instigate their plan . \\n▁ and even if they did , i must admit i ' m shocked that any of them touched you , even my father . \\n▁ scared you . \\n▁ warned you . \\n▁ threatened you . \\n▁ shared things with you i was keeping from you . \\n▁ yes . \\n▁ touched you . \\n▁ no . \\n▁ not any of them and especially not my father . '' \\n▁ ` ` maybe we should talk more about this , '' i suggested . \\n▁ ` ` what are you planning ? '' \\n▁ ` ` marcello and katrina have been caught , as you know . \\n▁ they 're holding them awaiting me . \\n▁ cosmo and rafe are hunting nestor . \\n▁ they will hold him too . \\n▁ i will deal with them then i 'll hunt my father and deal with him . '' \\n▁ ` ` deal with them how , uh … exactly ? '' \\n▁ his mouth went hard , his eyes started burning in a scary way that -lrb- yes , i ' m deranged -rrb- was totally fabulous and he answered immediately , ` ` i will torture them until they scream their pleas for me to burn them . \\n▁ then i will burn them . '' \\n▁ i was n't certain how i felt about that . \\n▁ so i turned , pressing myself to him and whispered , ` ` darling , is n't that a bit - ? '' \\n▁ he interrupted me . \\n▁ ` ` it is my culture , leah . \\n▁ it 's how we deal with these things . \\n▁ it is n't only accepted , it 's expected . \\n▁ and it will be done . '' \\n▁ ` ` but you were married to katrina , '' i reminded him . \\n▁ ` ` and she attempted to attack you twice prior to the events ten days ago . \\n▁ that was enough for me to seek permission from the council to hunt her and end her life . \\n▁ and they would have granted it , leah . \\n▁ without demure . \\n▁ but this was worse . \\n▁ far worse . \\n▁ not only did they penetrate a concubine 's home , manhandle her , frighten her and lie to her , they tied up her servant who also has my protection . \\n▁ further , what edwina told me they told you , they are planning revolution . \\n▁ so not only are their deaths expected , they are necessary for the safety of your people and , in a way , mine . '' \\n▁ i could n't deny that . \\n▁ his hand left my jaw so his arm could wrap around me while he reminded me , ` ` this is your world now , pet . \\n▁ you must learn to accept these things . '' \\n▁ i nodded because he was right . \\n▁ it was wild , it was scary but then again , i had a long time to get used to it . \\n▁ ` ` do you have any more questions ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ i shook my head . \\n▁ ` ` then we must talk about the claiming , '' he stated . \\n▁ i blinked . \\n▁ ` ` the what ? '' \\n▁ i asked . \\n▁ ` ` if you wish a mortal 's wedding , i 'll give you one . \\n▁ but we 'll also have a claiming ceremony . '' \\n▁ oh my . \\n▁ i felt my belly turn squishy . \\n▁ ` ` what 's a claiming ceremony ? '' \\n▁ i whispered and his face got soft at my tone and probably the look on my face and also probably the fact he heard my heart skip a beat . \\n▁ ` ` it 's our ceremony , pet . \\n▁ words are spoken , i take of your blood , you take of mine then we share the words of claiming . \\n▁ much like the mortal 's ' i do ' . '' \\n▁ ` ` and what are the words of claiming ? '' \\n▁ i was still whispering . \\n▁ ` ` until the sun falls from the sky , '' he whispered back . \\n▁ that was nice . \\n▁ he said that earlier to me . \\n▁ i loved it then and now i loved it more knowing its meaning . \\n▁ ` ` i like that , '' i told him softly and he grinned . \\n▁ then he spoke . \\n▁ ` ` for us , it will be real and right now , i need to know you understand that . '' \\n▁ ` ` understand ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that it 's real . '' \\n▁ ` ` that what 's real ? '' \\n▁ ` ` that we will be together until the sun falls from the sky . '' \\n▁ oh yes . \\n▁ that was nice and i loved it . \\n▁ ` ` i told you i liked it . '' \\n▁ ` ` you told me , leah , but you 're forty years old . \\n▁ i ' m eight hundred and twenty - two . \\n▁ i have a fair understanding of what immortality means . \\n▁ you have no idea . \\n▁ although it was understandable , it was a loss to all of us when isobel 's mother took her life . \\n▁ living forever may seem alluring but life is the same whether you 're mortal or immortal . \\n▁ there are highs and lows , good times and bad . \\n▁ and , bottom line , there 's a lot of time . \\n▁ a lot of time to travel , read , make love , eat and a lot of time to disagree , fight , get frustrated with each other . \\n▁ and there will be a lot of time to get bored . '' \\n▁ ` ` i never get bored , '' i informed him . \\n▁ ` ` everyone gets bored , '' lucien informed me . \\n▁ ` ` well , i do n't unless i have absolutely nothing to do like when you left me in the house with no wheels and no books and that was an extreme circumstance . \\n▁ still , i found something to do . \\n▁ and , if you 're with me , '' i grinned at him , ` ` you wo n't get bored either . '' \\n▁ lucien returned my grin then leaned in and touched his mouth to mine . \\n▁ but when he pulled back , his face was serious . \\n▁ ` ` you 'll well outlive your entire family , sweetling , '' he warned gently . \\n▁ my mood subdued at a thought i had n't yet had . \\n▁ a thought that really stunk . \\n▁ but i nodded and whispered , ` ` yes , but i 'll also get the chance to know their children . \\n▁ and their children 's children . \\n▁ so i 'll always , in some way , have family . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's a nice way to look at it , '' he muttered and i felt my lips tip up . \\n▁ then i pressed even closer and told him , ` ` i know what you 're trying to make me understand , darling . \\n▁ and i ca n't tell the future . \\n▁ but i ' m looking forward to it , as long as it seems , as far as it goes , as long as you 're in it . '' \\n▁ he pulled me tight to him , his mouth descending to mine , his tongue sliding inside as he rolled to his back , shifting under me . \\n▁ my hands went into his hair on either side of his head to hold him to me even though he was n't going anywhere . \\n▁ his hands went up my shirt to my bare ass , his fingers curving in to hold me to him and i was definitely going nowhere . \\n▁ i broke my mouth from his , slid it down to his ear and whispered , ` ` i could study to be a doctor . '' \\n▁ then i slid my lips to the hinge of his jaw and kept whispering . \\n▁ ` ` and when i get bored of that , i could study to be a sculptor . '' \\n▁ my lips moved to his neck . \\n▁ ` ` then i could become a lawyer . '' \\n▁ my lips moved to his throat . \\n▁ ` ` and i 'd have centuries to my perfect my xxunk sauce . '' \\n▁ i felt his body shaking under mine , his fingers pressed into the cheeks of my ass and my head went up so i could smile down at him . \\n▁ then the smile slid away from my face and i whispered , ` ` i 'll never get bored , darling . '' \\n▁ his heated eyes turned soft then suddenly i was on my back with lucien covering me . \\n▁ i caught my breath at this maneuver but understood it five seconds later when i heard the clinking and jingling of a cart being rolled into the room . \\n▁ ` ` dinner , '' the hotel butler called . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll set it at the table in the sitting room . \\n▁ is that okay with you ? '' \\n▁ ` ` perfect , '' lucien answered , his eyes on me . \\n▁ i giggled . \\n▁ the butler laid out our food . \\n▁ then lucien 's gaze roamed over my face . \\n▁ ` ` perfect , '' he repeated on a whisper and my stomach dropped then his head descended and he resumed kissing me . \\n▁ epilogue the future her fists in his hair became insistent . \\n▁ he felt it , stopped feeding , lashed his tongue along the wound and gave his bride what she wanted . \\n▁ he tipped his head back and looked at her . \\n▁ she slid down , filling herself full of him , her eyelids heavy , christ , so beautiful . \\n▁ but her focus was all on him . \\n▁ ` ` this is our eternity , '' she whispered and his arms , already wrapped around her , went so tight he felt it as the gentle wind of her breath stroked his face . \\n▁ all he could see was her beautiful features . \\n▁ all he could feel was her body in his arms , her sex wrapped around his cock , her thighs pressed tight to his hips , her br * * sts to his chest , her arms curved around his shoulders holding him close . \\n▁ all he could smell was the overpowering scent of her excitement . \\n▁ all he could taste on his tongue was her blood mingled with her skin and her pu * * y. all he could hear was her heart beating , her excited breaths . \\n▁ ` ` this is our eternity , '' he agreed quietly . \\n▁ her lids grew heavier even as she smiled an alluring smile . \\n▁ ` ` give me beauty , my vampire , '' she demanded . \\n▁ instantly , he flipped her to her back and gave into her demand . \\n▁ * * * * * lucien 's eyes opened , the dream still on him . \\n▁ so real it was like it happened . \\n▁ the moment his eyes opened , he felt leah shift against him . \\n▁ his arm around her grew tighter . \\n▁ his other arm moved to circle her . \\n▁ she slid up his body and looked into his eyes . \\n▁ hers were wondrous , her lips parted . \\n▁ fucking hell , he loved that look . \\n▁ but he knew . \\n▁ he knew even before she whispered , ` ` darling , i just had the best dream . '' \\n▁ ` ` this is our eternity , '' he stated , his voice rough with sleep and her eyes got wider . \\n▁ ` ` you dreamed it too ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ lucien nodded . \\n▁ ` ` wow . \\n▁ awesome , '' she whispered . \\n▁ he grinned thinking , sharing dreams like that with leah , eternity , already sweet , just became sweeter . \\n▁ then his arms grew taut around her , he rolled her and continued living the dream . \\n▁ * * * * * her scream still ringing around the room , lucien stepped away while watching katrina 's head drop . \\n▁ ` ` now , you burn , '' he said softly . \\n▁ he watched her breathe , the effort visibly taxing and he did this for some time . \\n▁ ` ` you tried to teach me , '' she whispered , hanging from her wrists pinned to the wall , her body limp , lifeless , nearly bloodless . \\n▁ ` ` it 's too late to tell me you ' ve learned , rina . '' \\n▁ lucien continued to speak soft . \\n▁ to his shock , her sagging body slumped deeper . \\n▁ he gave her time and , as he expected , she again spoke . \\n▁ ` ` i ' m okay with this , '' she went on in a whisper . \\n▁ ` ` i could n't live without you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' he replied and watched her put extreme effort into lifting her eyes to him . \\n▁ ` ` not at all , '' she admitted . \\n▁ ` ` not even for a second . '' \\n▁ ` ` i know , '' he repeated . \\n▁ ` ` you love her ? '' \\n▁ she asked , the stamp of agony in her face twisting with new pain . \\n▁ ` ` yes , '' he answered shortly . \\n▁ she 'd endured enough . \\n▁ now it was time for her pain to end . \\n▁ but just like rina , she begged for more . \\n▁ ` ` i wanted you to love me like that , '' she told him something he already knew . \\n▁ lucien made no reply . \\n▁ ` ` why could n't you love me like that ? '' \\n▁ she asked . \\n▁ ` ` rina , let julian take you to the stake , '' lucien replied gently . \\n▁ ` ` give me that before i die . \\n▁ tell me why . \\n▁ why could n't you love me like that ? '' \\n▁ lucien sighed then reminded her , ` ` i ' ve told you why . '' \\n▁ she smiled a humorless smile before she whispered , ` ` i 'll listen now . '' \\n▁ he held her eyes . \\n▁ then he answered , ` ` because you wanted it so badly . '' \\n▁ ` ` that 's not good ? '' \\n▁ she asked , genuinely perplexed . \\n▁ lucien shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` the moment i understood leah 's love for me caused her pain , i knew i had to let her go . \\n▁ even knowing losing her i would lose everything . \\n▁ i was willing to sacrifice everything to ease her pain . \\n▁ and when i understood i loved her but if we stayed together our time would be short and end in tragedy , i understood this more completely . \\n▁ and i was determined to let her go to prolong her life in hopes , during it , she might find happiness . \\n▁ what you failed to learn is that true love is not selfish , rina . \\n▁ it 's selfless . '' \\n▁ she gazed at him , even in her state the unhealthy , fevered , obsessive love she had for him burned in her eyes . \\n▁ quietly , he finished , ` ` you never understood that . '' \\n▁ ` ` no , '' she whispered , ` ` and i still do n't . \\n▁ today , i die for my love for you , lucien . '' \\n▁ ` ` if it makes you feel better to believe that , rina , then i ' m pleased you do , '' lucien returned on a whisper . \\n▁ she continued to gaze at him he knew in order to steal more of his time and attention . \\n▁ but he was done . \\n▁ he stepped away and jerked his chin at his son . \\n▁ julian moved forward . \\n▁ lucien did n't watch as his son carried his ex - mate over his shoulder out of the room . \\n▁ instead , he pulled out his phone and made three calls . \\n▁ two were business . \\n▁ one was to leah to tell her he 'd be home soon . \\n▁ she told him she was making her fried chicken . \\n▁ this was something over the past week since they returned that he was growing accustomed to . \\n▁ a new nuance of his soon - to - be bride . \\n▁ she did n't ask about the unpleasant business , simply waited for him to tell her if he so desired . \\n▁ but she was attuned to him . \\n▁ now that he 'd opened it to her , both of them could sense each other 's moods with an acuity that had nothing to do with body language , facial expressions or tone of voice . \\n▁ they tracked each other easily . \\n▁ so she knew when he had them and she made certain she did something , sometimes large , sometimes small , to make his unpleasant days end well . \\n▁ he finished his call with leah and moved outside . \\n▁ bel was there . \\n▁ stephanie . \\n▁ rafe . \\n▁ duncan . \\n▁ and xxunk was there to represent the council . \\n▁ when lucien arrived , julian handed him the torch . \\n▁ without delay , he threw it at the wood and kindling at katrina 's feet . \\n▁ and he gave her one last thing . \\n▁ lucien held her eyes as she burned . \\n▁ when she was no longer of this world , he left , leaving xxunk to gather the ashes and scatter them to the winds . \\n▁ * * * * * lucien sat back and yanked off the white gloves they 'd asked him to wear before he handled the ancient parchments . \\n▁ it was over a month after he 'd found leah . \\n▁ he was in the ancient city of xxunk in a windowless , air - controlled , intensely secured room in the basement the dominion 's international headquarters . \\n▁ he lifted his head and looked across the table at avery , gregor and rudolf . \\n▁ ` ` this does not make me happy , '' he muttered his understatement . \\n▁ he 'd just seen the prophesies or what they would allow him to see . \\n▁ he had no idea what else there was . \\n▁ however , they had shown him some of what referred to leah and himself . \\n▁ ` ` that 's understandable , '' rudolf replied . \\n▁ ` ` do you now understand why we ' ve asked you to refrain from hunting your father ? '' \\n▁ avery asked carefully . \\n▁ ` ` i understand it but i do n't like it , '' lucien answered tightly . \\n▁ ` ` as you can see from those documents , he is surely the general of the xxunk noted in them . \\n▁ if his death is precipitous , it could tip war and we 're not ready , '' rudolf explained . \\n▁ ` ` i did read that in the parchments , rudolf , '' lucien muttered with irritation . \\n▁ ` ` you will have your time , '' avery assured him quietly . \\n▁ he f * * king well would . \\n▁ lucien nodded . \\n▁ ` ` she 's already exhibiting the abilities , '' gregor stated , looking at him closely . \\n▁ lucien briefly weighed the wisdom of answering , glanced at avery who already knew and decided . \\n▁ ` ` she has exceptional powers of the mind . \\n▁ she can mark me . \\n▁ track me . \\n▁ sense my mood and , therefore , when she 's with me , sense danger when i do . \\n▁ she can speak to me with her mind and , as the days go by , this power increases significantly . \\n▁ indeed , if i wished , i could call to her where she 's sitting at a cafe across the street and she 'd hear me . \\n▁ she could do the same . \\n▁ we also have begun to share dreams , having them separately and , on occasion , simultaneously . '' \\n▁ he gestured to the papers on the table before him . \\n▁ ` ` however , she does not demonstrate uncommon speed or strength . '' \\n▁ ` ` you are vampire , she is mortal , lucien , would you know if she had uncommon speed or strength for a mortal ? '' \\n▁ rudolf asked an excellent question . \\n▁ before he could answer , gregor spoke . \\n▁ ` ` we would like to ask you to speak to her about submitting herself for testing . '' \\n▁ lucien 's felt his body prepare for battle , his adrenalin releasing , his muscles expanding and he immediately replied , ` ` absolutely not . '' \\n▁ ` ` lucien - '' gregor began but lucien leaned forward . \\n▁ ` ` you get near her without my permission , i 'll tear you apart and then you 'll burn , '' lucien vowed , his voice low and unmistakable . \\n▁ gregor gestured to the table . \\n▁ ` ` you can see from what you ' ve read that it 's important we understand we 're in the position to combat this threat . '' \\n▁ ` ` my bride is not a mutant warrior in this war to be prodded and researched , '' lucien clipped . \\n▁ ` ` there are yet two other lifemates to unite . \\n▁ we will allow matters to play out and as they do , she and i will decide how we will proceed . '' \\n▁ ` ` we do n't have a great deal of time . \\n▁ callum will mate with sonia before christmas this very year , '' gregor told him and lucien held his eyes . \\n▁ callum was king of the werewolves . \\n▁ lucien knew him . \\n▁ lucien respected him . \\n▁ sonia , he knew , was the name of gregor 's mortal charge . \\n▁ ` ` sonia ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked . \\n▁ ` ` yes , sonia , '' gregor answered then clarified , talking quietly , ` ` my sonia . '' \\n▁ ` ` so this is why you took her into your care , '' lucien surmised . \\n▁ ` ` that and i held deep regard for her parents prior to their deaths and affection for her prior to her losing them , '' gregor replied . \\n▁ lucien nodded but he did not share further words on the topic . \\n▁ the prophesies were vague as prophesies tended to be but it was not vague what would befall sonia , the woman who would soon be the mortal queen of the werewolves . \\n▁ gregor knew of this . \\n▁ and gregor was hiding his despair at the knowledge . \\n▁ instead , he asked , ` ` does she know ? \\n▁ callum ? '' \\n▁ gregor shook his head . \\n▁ ` ` no . \\n▁ and they wo n't . \\n▁ as this was kept from you and leah , it will also be kept from the other mates . \\n▁ as you read , it is essential that every immortal demonstrates his ability to make a crucial , selfless sacrifice for his mortal lifemate . \\n▁ and it is essential that every mortal demonstrate her generosity to or protection of immortals . \\n▁ to establish an eternity of peace between the species , the three must xxunk that we can live together through diversity and in harmony . '' \\n▁ he 'd read this in the prophesies . \\n▁ it was annoying but it was understandable . \\n▁ ` ` and the third lifemates ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked . \\n▁ ` ` they have not been located , '' rudolf answered . \\n▁ ` ` we believe the male is living amongst mortals . \\n▁ their story is xxunk in the prophesies but we believe from studying the parchments that he knows who he is , what he 's capable of . \\n▁ he feeds from mortals , he morphs to wolf . \\n▁ but he does not know of the existence of others of his kind . \\n▁ he thinks he is an anomaly , hides his abilities and lives underground . \\n▁ therefore , it is difficult to find him . '' \\n▁ ` ` perhaps he has not yet come into existence , '' lucien suggested . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' avery whispered , ` ` sonia 's destiny will play out shortly . \\n▁ the noble war is nearly upon us . \\n▁ he 's out there as is she , whoever she may be . '' \\n▁ lucien tipped up his chin then remarked , ` ` if he thinks he 's an anomaly , he 's correct . \\n▁ unless i ' m mistaken , he would be the only vampire , werewolf hybrid in history . '' \\n▁ ` ` in the years to come , many things will change , lucien , '' avery replied . \\n▁ ` ` many . \\n▁ what was impossible will be exceptional but possible . \\n▁ then it will become commonplace . '' \\n▁ as it always had been . \\n▁ as , he hoped to christ , it always would be for a very long time . \\n▁ lucien moved on . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll be telling leah of the prophesies , '' he announced and the three other men in the room tensed . \\n▁ ` ` this is unwise , '' gregor muttered . \\n▁ ` ` why ? '' \\n▁ lucien shot back and gregor 's eyes slid to avery . \\n▁ ` ` it is n't unwise , '' lucien stated and gregor 's gaze came back . \\n▁ ` ` you 're intent to keep your secrets from being revealed . \\n▁ but i can assure you she wo n't speak of them . '' \\n▁ ` ` can you be certain ? '' \\n▁ rudolf asked . \\n▁ ` ` she is mortal but there are many mortals who are far from stupid , rudolf , '' lucien returned . \\n▁ ` ` i 'll explain to her the importance of keeping the secret and she 'll understand it . \\n▁ i 'll also explain the consequences of not keeping it and she 'll definitely understand that . '' \\n▁ ` ` of course but she is also in the life . \\n▁ her family is in the life . \\n▁ what is to come , her part in it , she may be moved to warn them , '' rudolf replied . \\n▁ ` ` she wo n't speak of the prophesies , '' lucien repeated . \\n▁ ` ` it 's essential she does n't , '' gregor pressed , lucien looked to avery then back to gregor and impatiently reiterated , ` ` she will not speak of them . '' \\n▁ gregor took in a breath . \\n▁ then he nodded . \\n▁ lucien wanted to get back to leah so he demanded in the form of a request , ` ` i wish to speak to avery alone . '' \\n▁ glances were exchanged but rudolf and gregor assented , said their farewells and moved to leave the room . \\n▁ gregor , however , stopped at the door . \\n▁ ` ` the council wishes you to know that the access provided you to these documents means our debt is paid . '' \\n▁ ` ` servicing the dominion by hunting my own and taking them to their deaths for fifty years is hardly paid by providing me access to documents that describe , however vaguely , that myself and my bride face mortal perils in a noble war , '' lucien returned . \\n▁ ` ` that is surely my due and i regard it as such . \\n▁ tell the council i consider that i still hold the marker and i will call it when i need to use it . '' \\n▁ gregor held his eyes . \\n▁ then he sighed . \\n▁ then he tipped up his chin and left the room . \\n▁ lucien did n't speak until he sensed they were well out of hearing distance . \\n▁ then his eyes moved through the room . \\n▁ not finding what he was looking for , he turned his gaze to avery . \\n▁ ` ` is this room monitored ? '' \\n▁ he asked . \\n▁ ` ` no , '' avery answered . \\n▁ ` ` what i wish to discuss , it would be foolish to lie , '' lucien stated quietly . \\n▁ ` ` as has been explained , very few know of the prophesies , lucien . \\n▁ this is a humidity , air and temperature controlled room that holds nothing but the prophesies . \\n▁ access to it is strictly limited . \\n▁ security is state of the art . \\n▁ however , it does not include cameras or microphones . \\n▁ it would n't do for security guards to be able to catch a glimpse of the parchments or hear those allowed in this room discussing them . '' \\n▁ lucien nodded once . \\n▁ then he crossed his arms on his chest and stated quietly , ` ` you 're an ancient . '' \\n▁ avery slowly closed his eyes . \\n▁ he was . \\n▁ fucking hell . \\n▁ ` ` do you know our origin ? '' \\n▁ lucien asked and avery opened his eyes . \\n▁ ` ` i vow to you , lucien , that this is also a mystery to me , '' avery answered . \\n▁ ` ` are there others older than you ? '' \\n▁ lucien queried . \\n▁ ` ` i can not say , '' avery demurred . \\n▁ ` ` but there are other ancients , '' lucien went on . \\n▁ ` ` i can not say , '' avery repeated . \\n▁ ` ` how many people know that ancients still exist ? '' \\n▁ lucien pushed . \\n▁ ` ` one , '' avery answered . \\n▁ ` ` you . '' \\n▁ that was what he was looking for . \\n▁ an indication of trust . \\n▁ and he had it . \\n▁ this secret was more crucial to guard than the prophesies . \\n▁ lucien took a moment . \\n▁ then he reminded him quietly , ` ` my future bride and i risk much for this world . '' \\n▁ avery studied him . \\n▁ then he whispered , ` ` you do . \\n▁ and therefore i will give you another vow . \\n▁ there will be those who will do everything in their considerable power to keep the sacred triumvirate safe . \\n▁ but right now , this is all i can give you . '' \\n▁ ` ` i have children and the prophesies state that i will have four more . \\n▁ for reasons that , if the prophesies are true , are no longer accurate , leah and i do not use protection . \\n▁ if this noble war means my bride and i will perish and our children will live without parents or worse , die themselves , i need to know what you know and take precautions . '' \\n▁ ` ` you must find out along with me , '' avery replied . \\n▁ ` ` you know no more ? '' \\n▁ lucien pressed . \\n▁ avery extended a hand to the papers on the table . \\n▁ ` ` i wrote those parchments . \\n▁ i wrote everything i knew , lucien , everything that came to me . \\n▁ if i knew more , i would gladly tell you . \\n▁ i do n't . \\n▁ therefore , you must find out along with me . '' \\n▁ lucien held his gaze and read nothing . \\n▁ and he knew from this that when avery gave away the knowledge he was indeed an ancient , this was his intention . \\n▁ he tried once more by reminding him , ` ` i lived eight hundred and twenty - two years waiting for the woman who was destined for me . '' \\n▁ ` ` and we 're counting , very much , on your desire to keep hold of that destiny , '' avery returned . \\n▁ ` ` if that 's true , avery , then you are very lucky , '' lucien whispered . \\n▁ at that , avery smiled . \\n▁ lucien did n't smile back . \\n▁ he lifted his hand in a brief gesture of farewell and left the room to make his way to his mate . \\n▁ * * * * * ` ` okay , seriously , this is awesome ! '' \\n▁ leah exclaimed . \\n▁ she was sitting astride him . \\n▁ lucien was on his back in their bed in their hotel room in xxunk , leah straddling his hips . \\n▁ she was wearing a black , silk nightie adorned with thick edges of cream lace . \\n▁ they 'd just made love and her hair was a wild tumble around her shoulders . \\n▁ prior to their making love , he 'd given her an emerald cut , black diamond engagement ring . \\n▁ after , he told her of the prophesies . \\n▁ as was her way , her reaction surprised him . \\n▁ ` ` my pet , we 're talking about war , '' he reminded her quietly . \\n▁ she leaned into him , putting her hands to his chest , her face getting close to his . \\n▁ hers was still excited . \\n▁ ` ` yes , and you , me and the other four are going to kick ass , '' she declared then lurched back to sitting and cried , ` ` i ca n't wait to get superhuman abilities ! '' \\n▁ lucien shook his head , finding he could n't stop himself from grinning . \\n▁ then he sat up , his grin died and he wrapped his arms around her loosely . \\n▁ ` ` my love , '' he started to caution , ` ` anything can happen in war . '' \\n▁ she wrapped her arms loosely around his shoulders and tipped her head to the side . \\n▁ then she asked , ` ` darling , are you the mighty vampire lucien ? '' \\n▁ his lips twitched but he did n't answer . \\n▁ ` ` you are , '' she whispered , her arms getting tighter . \\n▁ ` ` you 're unstoppable . \\n▁ and you 're giving me your abilities . \\n▁ so we 'll be unstoppable . '' \\n▁ her expression grew serious as she pressed closer . \\n▁ ` ` before you get all mature vampire and impart wisdom on me , i 'll tell you , i get it . \\n▁ i ' ve never been in a war but everyone knows wars are to be avoided . \\n▁ and i hate to remind you of something that upsets you but edwina and i were attacked by four vampires . \\n▁ i had no power in that situation and i was terrified out of my mind . \\n▁ so it may be that my powers wo n't be akin to a vampires ' . \\n▁ but at least i 'll have a fighting chance . '' \\n▁ she was right . \\n▁ she 'd reminded him of something that upset him . \\n▁ greatly . \\n▁ lucien did n't share this and leah was n't done . \\n▁ ` ` but i also get something else . \\n▁ and i ' ve thought this for a long time even when you told me before that you were mostly like me . \\n▁ there is magic at work . \\n▁ and that magic , i know in my heart , led me to you . \\n▁ and if that 's the kind of magic we 're dealing with then it 's the good kind . \\n▁ and we have that on our side . \\n▁ and we have love on our side . \\n▁ and the other four will have love on their side too . \\n▁ and when you have our kind of love , you ca n't be beat because you wo n't allow yourself to be beat . '' \\n▁ ` ` i ca n't argue with that , '' he muttered and was rewarded with her smile . \\n▁ then her arms left his shoulders so her fingers could wrap around the sides of his neck and she tilted her face close . \\n▁ ` ` nothing will take you away from me , darling , '' her fingers squeezed , ` ` nothing . '' \\n▁ lucien stared into her beautiful eyes . \\n▁ then his arms tightened around her and he twisted her to her back as his mouth took hers in a searing kiss . \\n▁ when he lifted his head , she took in an unsteady breath . \\n▁ then she finished their conversation with a whispered , ` ` i get all this , '' her limbs gave him a squeeze and her lips gave him a smile , ` ` and kickass , superhuman abilities . \\n▁ i. . . \\n▁ ca n't … wait . '' \\n▁ lucien grinned down at her . \\n▁ then he dropped his head and kissed the smile away from her face . \\n▁ then he took his time doing a great many other things . \\n▁ things he could n't wait to do . \\n▁ * * * * * it was after the ancient claiming ceremony . \\n▁ after the celebration following . \\n▁ after nadia threw her back out xxunk at the celebration . \\n▁ but before they would board a plane in the morning to travel to italy for their honeymoon . \\n▁ her fists in his hair became insistent . \\n▁ he felt it , stopped feeding , lashed his tongue along the wound and gave his brand - new bride what she wanted . \\n▁ he tipped his head back and looked at her . \\n▁ she slid down on his cock , filling herself full of him , her eyelids heavy . \\n▁ christ , she was beautiful . \\n▁ so f * * king beautiful . \\n▁ her lids were heavy but her focus was all on him . \\n▁ ` ` this is our eternity , '' she whispered . \\n▁ his arms , already wrapped around her , went so tight he felt it as the gentle wind of her breath stroked his face . \\n▁ all he could see was her beautiful features . \\n▁ all he could feel was her body in his arms , her sex wrapped around his cock , her thighs pressed tight to his hips , her br * * sts to his chest , her arms curved around his shoulders holding him close . \\n▁ all he could smell was the overpowering scent of her excitement . \\n▁ all he could taste on his tongue was her blood mingled with her skin and her pu * * y. all he could hear was her heart beating , her excited breaths . \\n▁ ` ` this is our eternity , '' he agreed quietly . \\n▁ her lids grew heavier even as she smiled an alluring smile . \\n▁ a smile for his words . \\n▁ a smile because she , like he , knew they were living a dream . \\n▁ ` ` give me beauty , my vampire , '' she demanded . \\n▁ instantly , he flipped her to her back and gave into her demand . \\n▁ fuck , but he loved it when their dreams came true . \\n▁ literally .</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>"
